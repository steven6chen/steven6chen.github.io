Allergic reactions to proteins in HSP usually present as either systemic reactions or localized vaginal reactions during or following vaginal sexual intercourse, which are prevented by condom use. The clinical manifestations, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of HSP allergy will be discussed in this topic review.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23477746\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergic reactions to human seminal plasma (HSP) proteins present either as systemic allergic <span class=\"nowrap\">reactions/anaphylaxis</span> or as localized vaginal reactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17329331\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The largest review of published cases included 74 women. Seventy percent (52 patients) experienced systemic symptoms. Forty percent of those with systemic reactions also had local reactions, whereas approximately one-third of patients had <strong>only</strong> local reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. All types of reactions are prevented by the use of condoms, which is a critical component of the clinical history. (See <a href=\"#H621608421\" class=\"local\">'Clinical history'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29595059\"><span class=\"h3\">Systemic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaphylactic reactions to HSP typically begin within minutes after ejaculation. Initial symptoms commonly include localized vulvar and vaginal pruritus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> edema, followed by diffuse pruritus, nasal obstruction, itchy eyes, urticaria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angioedema, often involving the face, lips, tongue, and throat. Gastrointestinal symptoms and respiratory symptoms of dyspnea, wheezing, and stridor have also been reported during systemic reactions. Life-threatening anaphylaxis with profound hypotension and cardiovascular collapse requiring emergency treatment was reported in 16 patients in the series of 74 women mentioned previously, indicating that severe reactions are not characteristic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Anaphylactic deaths attributable to HSP allergy have not been confirmed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In addition to immediate-type systemic reactions, there are case reports of a patient presenting with a fixed cutaneous eruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and a serum sickness-like reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Another uncommon reaction is worsening of pre-existing eczema during the days following HSP anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29595069\"><span class=\"h3\">Local reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local vaginal reactions to seminal plasma are manifested by vulvar or vaginal pain, itching, burning, and edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Symptoms and signs may begin immediately following ejaculation or may be delayed in onset by minutes to hours. Vulvar and vaginal discomfort can last several days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>An immediate-onset pruritic rash accompanied by periorbital angioedema was reported in one case after cutaneous exposure to HSP without any history of vaginal intercourse, suggesting that the skin could be an important route of sensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Localized urticaria or eczema has been reported following contact of the skin with HSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Symptoms from oral contact have not been reported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17329338\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the large series already described, 87 percent of allergic reactions began within the first 30 minutes following ejaculation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This time course is consistent with an immediate-type allergic reaction (ie, beginning within one hour of exposure to the allergen). Symptoms usually resolved within 24 hours, although some symptoms (ie, vaginal pain, recurrent urticaria, and malaise) lingered for days to weeks.</p><p>Late-onset reactions, most of which were systemic reactions, accounted for 13 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Time to onset of symptoms ranged from 1 to 15 hours after coitus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H260552860\"><span class=\"h2\">Emotional impact</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of HSP hypersensitivity places significant strain on relationships [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, couples present with anxiety about their ability to conceive, although this is usually not a problem if the disorder is managed effectively. (See <a href=\"#H285562113\" class=\"local\">'Conception and pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5759455\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nearly one-half (41 percent) of all HSP-allergic reactions occur after a patient's first episode of sexual intercourse. However, anecdotal cases of HSP-allergic reactions specific to a certain male partner have been reported in women tolerating intercourse with previous partners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Once HSP allergy has developed, it is usually persistent and continues to occur with the woman's current partner, as well as with future partners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. There are no known reports of &quot;natural tolerance&quot; developing with repetitive intercourse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23477754\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human seminal plasma (HSP) allergy is seen exclusively in women. Over 60 percent of women presenting with HSP allergy are between the ages of 20 and 30, although new-onset symptoms have been reported after age 50 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The general prevalence of seminal plasma allergy is unknown, although it has been described worldwide. There are only about 80 cases of HSP-allergic reactions well-documented in the medical literature. However, due to the socially sensitive nature of this problem and the broad differential diagnosis of localized reactions, it is likely under-reported or mistaken for nonallergic vulvovaginitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>A questionnaire survey was conducted to estimate prevalence among 1000 women in North America who voluntarily reported postcoital symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In this survey, 266 women reported 130 events (84 systemic and 46 localized). Reactions were classified as &quot;probable&quot; HSP hypersensitivity reactions if symptoms were consistently prevented by use of condoms. Skin testing and serum-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) were not performed to confirm HSP allergy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17329520\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A history of other allergic disorders was present in over 80 percent of women with human seminal plasma (HSP) allergy in the large review previously described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Anecdotal reports suggest that adult atopic dermatitis and asthma are common clinical features of women presenting with severe HSP-induced anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/4,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10,11</a>]. However, HSP anaphylaxis has also been reported in nonatopic women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Based upon case reports, HSP allergy has been associated with reproductive events or surgical procedures, such as the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long intercourse-free periods (eg, pregnancy).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Menopause.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insertion of an intrauterine device.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hysterectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous prostatectomy or reversal of vasectomy in the male partner, although the clinical relevance of these procedures is unclear because many women develop HSP allergy with their first intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23477762\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, systemic human seminal plasma (HSP) reactions are caused by a type I immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In contrast, most localized reactions to HSP do not appear to involve IgE, nor have other causative immune mechanisms been clearly established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>].</p><p>However, there is anecdotal evidence that other immunologic mechanisms can account for some reactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80466\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80466 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is at least one case report of a delayed-onset systemic reaction consisting of periorbital edema, skin rash, arthralgias, and diarrhea beginning approximately eight hours after ejaculation and lasting four to five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A type III immunologic mechanism was implicated in this serum sickness-like reaction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80466\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80466 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is at least one report of a woman with a fixed cutaneous reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H621609142\"><span class=\"h2\">Allergens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple allergenic proteins with molecular weights ranging from 12 to 75 kDa have been identified in HSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/1,9,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,19</a>]. In one case report, serum-specific IgE binding to a 33 kDa protein with a molecular weight identical to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was demonstrated in a patient with HSP anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In contrast, sperm proteins have not been implicated as allergens, and artificial insemination using sperm intensively washed free of HSP is well-tolerated in women with severe HSP allergy. (See <a href=\"#H285562113\" class=\"local\">'Conception and pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p>The observation that approximately 41 percent of all HSP-allergic reactions occur following the first episode of sexual intercourse suggests that susceptible women can become sensitized prior to their first known contact with human semen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. The prevalence of HSP-specific IgE in women without HSP allergy has not been studied. There are some data to suggest that sensitization may result from exposure to cross-sensitizing dog proteins, although this is only one theory. In one study, 24 percent of patients with serum-specific IgE to dog dander exhibited IgE binding to PSA, suggesting existence of cross-reactivity between the major HSP allergen and dog epithelial allergen, which has been identified as Can f 5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Prostatic kallikrein is a major dog allergen found in dog urine and epithelium that cross-reacts with human PSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Based on this data, it is possible that women with pre-existing dog allergy may be at greater risk for HSP allergy. However, not all women with HSP hypersensitivity are dog owners, although dog allergens are abundant in most indoor environments. There is little utility to evaluating patients for sensitivity to dog allergens, since commercial extracts cannot reliably exclude sensitization to relevant prostatic allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23477778\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H621608421\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A history of localized or systemic reactions following ejaculation and prevented by the use of condoms should prompt investigation by an allergist with knowledge of the evaluation and management of human seminal plasma (HSP) allergy.</p><p>The following questions are helpful in determining if a patient's history is consistent with HSP allergy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you experience the sensation of vaginal burning during or after ejaculation? If yes, is it prevented by use of a condom?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you experienced hives, swelling (angioedema), chest tightness, shortness of breath, wheezing, diarrhea, dizziness, or loss of consciousness during or after ejaculation? If yes, is it prevented by use of a condom?</p><p/><p>In addition, affected women should be questioned about latex, food, or medication allergies. If the woman has known allergies to foods or medications, the history should be explored to determine if a food or drug could have been ingested by the male partner within two to three hours prior to intercourse and passed from the male to the female partner through the ejaculate. (See <a href=\"#H23477786\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>If not already done, the patient should have a thorough gynecologic evaluation to exclude other causes of vaginal discomfort. (See <a href=\"#H23477786\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H621608428\"><span class=\"h2\">Objective testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with a history suggestive of systemic HSP allergy should be assessed for immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic sensitization to HSP, as well as those patients reporting immediate-onset local symptoms (ie, vaginal pruritus, angioedema).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1790482\"><span class=\"h3\">In vitro testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific IgE assays for seminal plasma are commercially available, but these tests have not been clinically validated. It is the author's experience that these tests are rarely positive, even in patients with HSP anaphylaxis, and a negative test result does not exclude HSP allergy. Therefore, skin prick testing (not intradermal) with whole or fractionated HSP is preferred over serologic testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1790475\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin testing with whole seminal plasma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before HSP skin prick testing is undertaken, the issue of transmission of bloodborne illnesses should be addressed with the couple. We generally test the patient's male partner for serologic evidence of active hepatitis A, B, and C, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and syphilis. Testing or treatment procedures should not be performed with HSP from a partner infected with any of these pathogens, unless that female partner is also confirmed to be infected and gives consent.</p><p>The male partner then submits a fresh semen sample, which is allowed to liquefy (ie, sit undisturbed) for 30 minutes at room temperature in a tube. The upper layer (HSP) is used for skin prick testing. If possible, the sample can be centrifuged (as described below) and the supernatant used for testing.</p><p>Positive (eg, histamine) and negative (saline diluent) controls should be included, as with skin testing to any allergen. The male partner commonly serves as a control and undergoes identical skin tests to exclude the possibility of false-positive irritant skin reactions in the female patient. Technical issues related to skin testing are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;, section on 'Controls'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1790501\"><span class=\"h4\">Interpretation of results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A skin prick test with undiluted whole HSP eliciting a wheal of 3 mm greater than or equal to saline control with surrounding erythema (ie, flare response) is positive, confirming HSP allergy. The male partner should have a negative result.</p><p>If the clinical history is suggestive of HSP hypersensitivity and skin prick testing with whole HSP is negative, it may be a false-negative result due to low concentrations of HSP allergens. In the latter case, sensitization should be further evaluated with individual HSP fractions. The use of intradermal testing with whole HSP for confirming HSP hypersensitivity is not recommended, based on evidence demonstrating false-positive skin test responses to HSP fractions in male volunteers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1790548\"><span class=\"h2\">Referral for advanced evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a false-negative result is suspected, HSP allergens can be concentrated by column fractionation, which is performed at specialized treatment centers and is relatively costly and labor intensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, couples regularly choose to pursue this therapy, and in most cases, they are also planning to undergo subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) to the fractionated HSP preparation.</p><p>Fractionation requires that multiple ejaculate samples be collected from the male partner. The pooled sample is centrifuged at 1000 g for 30 minutes to separate the spermatozoa from the HSP. The HSP is then run through a column, which isolates those fractions of HSP rich in protein allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/12,24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,24,27</a>]. Five or more HSP fractions are typically collected, filter-sterilized by syringe through a 0.22 micron filter, and then dialyzed to exclude all materials below molecular weights of 6000 to 8000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Prick and intradermal skin testing is performed with each fraction, identifying the allergenic ones. If indicated, HSP immunotherapy may then be performed with one or more allergenic fractions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23477786\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several conditions that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of human seminal plasma (HSP) allergy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vulvodynia (also known as vulvar vestibulitis syndrome) is a condition of chronic pain localized to the vulva or vestibule and triggered by vulvar penetration or physical activity. The clinical manifestations of vulvodynia and local HSP hypersensitivity overlap. HSP allergy has been confirmed in a subset of patients diagnosed with vulvodynia. Serum-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) bound to seminal plasma was detected in 50 percent of vulvodynia patients reporting pain exclusively during or after coitus and prevented by condoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/16,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,29</a>].

These conditions are not prevented by use of condoms.

Couples may have tried various barrier devices and found some are tolerated while others are not. If necessary, patch testing can be performed to identify a device that does not cause contact reactions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) or postcoital asthma triggered by sexual intercourse can be confused with HSP-induced anaphylaxis. However, use of a condom does not prevent EIB. Patients suspected of having EIB can be instructed to use an inhaled bronchodilator 10 minutes before intercourse, which should partially or completely prevent symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Natural rubber latex allergy can cause localized or systemic allergic reactions when latex condoms are used. If symptoms occur when latex condoms are used, a leak in the condom product must be excluded. If this cannot be excluded, nonlatex condoms should be tried. The patient should be informed that nonlatex condoms may not effectively prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. When latex allergy is suspected, evaluation should be conducted with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared specific IgE immunoassays <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> skin prick testing with latex extract, provided a suitable skin test reagent is available. Concurrent sensitization to both latex and HSP has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

In such cases, reactions only occur when the male partner ingests the allergenic food or drug or receives the drug in a period of hours to one day before intercourse. With some medications (eg, chemotherapy), the medication may be present in the male partner's body for several days, which must be considered when evaluating the temporal pattern of reactions. In either scenario, allergic reactions with intercourse do not occur consistently. Sensitization to suspected allergens should be confirmed in female patients with appropriate tests.

In addition, condom use does not meet the needs of couples who wish to conceive naturally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17329639\"><span class=\"h2\">Prophylactic antihistamines and cromolyn</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a case report, premedication with antihistamines was effective in preventing mild postcoital-systemic urticarial reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, antihistamine pretreatment has not been demonstrated to be effective in preventing HSP anaphylaxis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28170123\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of localized reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are warned that unprotected intercourse without condoms can lead to more severe localized or systemic reactions. Intravaginal cromoglycate has been used prior to intercourse to prevent localized vaginal reactions, with inconsistent results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other than using condoms, immunotherapy with HSP is the only known effective treatment for preventing localized allergic reactions during intercourse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H285562113\"><span class=\"h2\">Conception and pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two approaches to conception are described in women with HSP allergy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravaginal or subcutaneous desensitization can allow couples to conceive naturally. Uncomplicated pregnancies and births have been consistently achieved in this manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Artificial insemination with spermatozoa extensively washed free of HSP has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/9,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,36</a>]. Most HSP-allergic women have tolerated such procedures well, although allergic reactions to washed spermatozoa have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. In addition, this approach does not allow for natural conception.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17329646\"><span class=\"h2\">Desensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Desensitization through immunotherapy with HSP may be considered for those patients who find condom use unacceptable or for those wishing to conceive naturally. Both intravaginal and subcutaneous routes of HSP immunotherapy have been successful. These procedures should only be performed in a clinical facility that is fully equipped and adequately staffed for treating anaphylaxis.</p><p>Following successful desensitization, the patient can tolerate unprotected sexual intercourse with her male partner. However, the couple must have unprotected intercourse two to three times weekly to maintain the desensitized state.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H621609003\"><span class=\"h3\">Intravaginal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several case reports of intravaginal desensitization using the male partner's semen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/33,34,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34,39,40</a>]. Intravaginal desensitization has advantages over injection therapy in that it does not require a laboratory or incur the significant costs associated with collection, preparation, and analysis of HSP fractions. However, this approach is not uniformly successful in preventing reactions during intercourse. Based upon the author's experience, many patients referred for subcutaneous desensitization have failed intravaginal protocols. No published series are available to provide estimates of the success of this approach.</p><p>Intravaginal immunotherapy is performed with whole seminal fluid. In one case report, the procedure was initiated with the intravaginal deposition of 2 mL of a 1:1,000,000 dilution of seminal fluid in normal saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Increasing 10-fold concentrations were then given every 45 minutes, until a dose of undiluted semen was deposited (ie, a seven-step protocol).</p><p>Unprotected sexual intercourse needs to be repeated two to three times weekly to maintain the desensitized state. Nonbarrier methods should be used for birth control when the couple does not want to conceive. Interruption of regular sexual intercourse can result in loss of tolerance and recurrence of postcoital-allergic reactions. Therefore, if one partner must travel for a period of time, semen can be collected in advance, refrigerated, and inserted intravaginally every three days to maintain tolerance.</p><p>If intravaginal desensitization is not successful and the couple wishes to conceive naturally, referral for subcutaneous desensitization with fractionated HSP should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The other alternative for conception is artificial insemination. (See <a href=\"#H285562113\" class=\"local\">'Conception and pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1790358\"><span class=\"h3\">Subcutaneous immunotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1984, subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) was performed successfully in a woman with seminal plasma anaphylaxis using HSP fractions isolated from pooled samples of the male partner's ejaculate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The HSP fraction was selected based on its ability to elicit a positive intradermal test and induce histamine release from the patient's basophils.</p><p>A rapid two-day SCIT protocol with HSP fractions has been used successfully in treating patients with immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated localized and systemic HSP reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/12,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,28</a>]. The author's clinic has successfully desensitized approximately 23 patients. After desensitization, patients discontinue injections and maintain the desensitized state by having unprotected intercourse with their partner, which should take place at least two to three times weekly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Less frequent intercourse may not be adequate to maintain tolerance. In the author's experience, couples are generally successful with this approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21691201\"><span class=\"h4\">Outcomes and fertility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HSP hypersensitivity does not appear to be associated with reduced fertility in most cases, although data on long-term outcomes are limited. In the author's experience, women with systemic reactions to HSP can be successfully treated and can conceive normally. In contrast, the outcomes of women with localized reactions to HSP seem more variable. A retrospective series included 12 women treated in the author's clinic with SCIT for localized HSP reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Patients were contacted by phone and asked a series of questions about how successful the treatment was and about subsequent efforts to conceive. Seven reported that treatment completely resolved their symptoms. Within this group, two subsequently had normal-term pregnancies, and one was pregnant at the time of the study. Two patients conceived but then miscarried. One patient did not try to conceive, and another was unable to. Another five women reported that treatment was partly successful or unsuccessful. Within this group, three had normal-term pregnancies. Overall, one-half of the 12 women with local HSP reaction had successful term pregnancies. This study had two findings of particular interest. First, three of the women who had successful term pregnancies experienced only partial or no relief of symptoms from the treatment, so successful treatment is not essential for pregnancy. Second, women who experience difficulty conceiving following treatment may have an unrelated fertility problem and should be referred for further evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23477802\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergic reactions to human seminal plasma (HSP) may present with either localized vaginal reactions, systemic allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), or both. The signs and symptoms begin after ejaculation, typically during or immediately following the completion of coitus. Symptoms are prevented by the use of condoms, which is an important piece of the clinical history. (See <a href=\"#H23477746\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HSP allergy is rare, although it may be under-reported because of the socially-sensitive nature of the problem or misdiagnosed as vulvovaginitis. The disorder occurs exclusively in women, most typically between the ages of 20 and 30 years of age. Once established, it usually occurs with other male partners and is persistent in the absence of desensitization therapy. (See <a href=\"#H23477754\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of HSP allergy should be suspected based upon the clinical history, combined with the demonstration of sensitization to HSP by skin prick testing with whole seminal plasma or allergen-containing fractions of HSP. (See <a href=\"#H23477778\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis includes reactions to other allergens (eg, latex) or substances applied to the vaginal area, exertion-related disorders (eg, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [EIB]), and the various disorders that present as vulvodynia and dyspareunia. (See <a href=\"#H23477786\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any woman who has experienced anaphylaxis due to HSP allergy should have an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjector prescribed and should be counseled to have it readily available during intercourse, as well as how and when to use it to self-inject epinephrine. (See <a href=\"#H1790619\" class=\"local\">'Epinephrine for anaphylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who do not wish to conceive and do not object to regular condom use, we suggest avoidance of HSP exposure through careful use of condoms (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This approach to management is simple, although there is some risk to the patient if a condom leaks or breaks. (See <a href=\"#H17329632\" class=\"local\">'Condoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who find condom use unacceptable or wish to conceive naturally, we suggest HSP desensitization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Desensitization can be accomplished using either intravaginal or subcutaneous protocols. (See <a href=\"#H17329646\" class=\"local\">'Desensitization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Artificial insemination with sperm washed free of HSP is another approach to conception that is well-tolerated by women with HSP hypersensitivity. (See <a href=\"#H285562113\" class=\"local\">'Conception and pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Shah A, Panjabi C.
