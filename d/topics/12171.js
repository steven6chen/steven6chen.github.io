When these elements do not clearly confirm or refute an allergy, the clinician, typically an allergy specialist or sometimes a gastroenterologist, may perform a clinician-supervised oral food challenge (OFC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. OFCs may also be used to determine if a food allergy has resolved. In addition, they can be undertaken to define other adverse reactions to foods, such as intolerance.</p><p>OFCs generally consist of a gradual feeding of the test food under close observation. The test usually results in a definitive conclusion about whether the food was tolerated.</p><p>An OFC is preceded by a period of dietary elimination, performed either therapeutically (because the food was already suspected or known to have caused a reaction) or for diagnostic reasons (to determine if elimination of the suspect food resulted in amelioration of symptoms).</p><p>This topic review will present the role of diagnostic elimination diets, the selection of patients for OFCs, different types of OFCs, and a general approach to performing an OFC. Other related food allergy topics are covered separately.

Elimination diets are used diagnostically to determine if symptoms, usually chronic in nature, resolve after the suspected food(s) is removed from the diet. Elimination diets are discussed in greater detail in another topic review, and avoidance of a food allergen once the allergy is diagnosed is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-avoidance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Avoidance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are three types of elimination diets:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elimination of one or several foods suspected to be causing symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elimination of all but a defined group of &quot;allowed&quot; foods (oligoantigenic diet)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An elemental diet consisting of a hydrolyzed formula or an amino acid-based formula</p><p/><p>The type of elimination diet chosen depends upon the clinical history and the results of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute IgE-mediated reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A patient may be instructed to avoid several potential causal foods if a reaction suggesting an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated disorder (eg, urticaria) occurred suddenly after a meal but a single causal food allergen could not be identified by testing or history. It is improbable that more than one food in a given meal would cause a reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elimination of multiple foods may be indicated for patients with certain chronic inflammatory diseases. For example, atopic dermatitis and eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases are associated with food allergy that is usually non-IgE mediated or mixed IgE and non-IgE mediated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/1,2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6</a>]. History, testing, and epidemiologic considerations may yield an extensive list of suspect foods. Thus, elimination of multiple foods is typically needed to determine if the disorder is food responsive.</p><p>A provisional diagnosis of food allergy is given if symptoms resolve, as documented by history, symptom diaries, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physical examination. However, OFCs are still needed to confirm the causal foods. Elimination diets can sometimes result in acute allergic reactions to foods that were previously in the diet when these foods are reintroduced.

Variables to consider when trying to determine if a food allergy has resolved include specific IgE tests, age of the individual, time since the last reaction, and the outcomes after recent accidental exposures, if any. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergy in children: Prevalence, natural history, and monitoring for resolution&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1022166511\"><span class=\"h1\">INAPPROPRIATE APPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is generally no clinical reason to perform a diagnostic OFC if there has been recent, severe anaphylaxis to an isolated ingestion with a positive test for specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody to the causal food. In addition, an OFC may not be relevant when the food or food family being eliminated is not important to the allergic individual's diet and can be simply avoided (eg, a rarely ingested fruit).</p><p>OFCs may not accurately reflect reactions outside of the challenge setting, because OFCs use a gradual administration of the tested food and the challenge is discontinued if symptoms occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus, OFCs should not be undertaken solely to document severity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DECIDING TO PROCEED TO AN OFC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical and patient factors must be considered when determining if it is appropriate to undertake an OFC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F55879\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55879 \">table 1</a>). Patient preferences and concerns are important to consider and should be discussed with the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span>. OFCs should only be performed when the food is expected to become part of the diet since recurrence of food allergy after a negative challenge, although uncommon, is associated with continued avoidance or infrequent ingestion of the challenge food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Based upon a study of young children with egg, milk, or peanut allergy, OFCs resulting in reactions were not associated with increases in food-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) or skin test responses, so this concern should not deter performing the diagnostic procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3882957098\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medical history, skin test results, and in vitro test results may be used to estimate the risk of current allergy. Data are conflicting as to whether increasing concentrations of food-specific antibodies and size of reactions on skin testing correlate with the severity of a reaction during a challenge, possibly because of additional factors affecting severity including dose ingested and comorbid conditions such as asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/13-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-avoidance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Avoidance&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;History and physical examination in the patient with possible food allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergy in children: Prevalence, natural history, and monitoring for resolution&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As an example, a patient with an egg allergy had a reaction a few months ago after an accidental exposure. The in vitro test for food-specific IgE to egg is now negative. However, the prior probability that this patient is still allergic to egg is high, given the relatively recent reaction. A clinician may decide to proceed with the challenge if the skin test to egg is negative as this indicates a lower likelihood of reacting during the challenge. Conversely, a challenge may be deferred if the patient has a large positive reaction on skin testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>OFCs performed after a period of elimination have resulted in acute and severe reactions, even though the food was previously associated only with chronic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. This occurs most commonly when there is a positive specific IgE test for the food. This risk must be considered prior to trial diagnostic elimination diets and during OFCs. As an example, in a retrospective chart review of patients presenting to a tertiary care allergy clinic with a concern for food-triggered atopic dermatitis, 19 percent with food-triggered atopic dermatitis and no prior acute allergic reactions to the eliminated food experienced immediate reactions on re-exposure. Of these reactions, 30 percent were anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1306893014\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient/family preference</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Agreement upon the correct time to undertake a food challenge requires joint consideration by the clinician and the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span>. Some clinicians typically offer food challenges for young children when risks of having a reaction to the challenge are approximately 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Others suggest challenges when the risk is higher, on the grounds that avoidance, especially of staple foods, is a significant burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In contrast, some <span class=\"nowrap\">patients/families</span> may prefer to wait until there is a greater chance of tolerating the food (a negative challenge).</p><p>As an example, the family of a two-year-old child with a 90 percent risk of peanut allergy may not consider an OFC worthwhile because the food is easily avoided and the chance of tolerating it may improve with time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Conversely, it may be useful to perform on OFC in a teenager with the same 90 percent risk to determine with certainty whether the patient needs to continue avoidance since teenagers are more prone to risk taking and may otherwise try the food on their own.</p><p>Families may decline an offered OFC based upon incorrect assumptions. As examples, they may not understand the benefit of adding that particular food to the diet, may assume a reaction is likely or fear a reaction, or may plan to attempt home introduction, which could result in reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. These are best addressed in anticipatory guidance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1555894837\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutritional importance of the food</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Food challenges may be indicated to allow expansion of the diet, despite poor odds of tolerance, in a child whose nutritional status is negatively impacted because of the avoidance of multiple foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3030058338\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of a reaction (positive challenge result)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A child with fear of eating because of past severe reactions may warrant psychological treatment prior to OFC to reduce the risk that a reaction during OFC would increase food avoidance behaviors. Some studies suggest that an OFC, whether showing tolerance or allergy, may result in improved quality of life and may even decrease, rather than increase, anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF FOOD CHALLENGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three general types of OFCs: open, single-blind, and double-blind challenges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/1,2,5,6,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5,6,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Open OFC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An open OFC involves gradually feeding the tested food in its natural state (eg, peanut butter) to patients who know that they are eating the food being tested. This method is potentially prone to patient and observer bias because of expectations of a reaction, but it is easy to perform since no special preparation is needed. There is little concern about bias if the patient tolerates the ingestion of the food. However, bias must be considered when symptoms develop, especially if they are subjective.</p><p>Open challenges are a good option for screening when several foods are under consideration or there is minimal concern about observer or patient bias. The test can be repeated with blinding and controls if there is a reaction to an open challenge and there is concern that the reaction may have been anxiety related rather than physiologic. Open feeding is also used to follow a double-blind, placebo-controlled OFC (DBPCFC) to ensure a meal-sized portion of the food is tolerated in its natural state. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Single-blind OFC'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Double-blind, placebo-controlled OFC'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Single-blind OFC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Single-blind challenges require that the food be masked in taste by adding it to another food or hidden in opaque capsules. This procedure helps to alleviate some patient bias. However, the single-blind OFC does not remove observer bias.</p><p>The single-blind challenge may be performed with a placebo arm, or the operator may decide to use initial placebo doses to observe for subjective symptoms prior to proceeding with the challenge.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Double-blind, placebo-controlled OFC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The DBPCFC is considered the gold standard for diagnosing food allergy and is preferred for research purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The tested food is hidden in another food. Bias is reduced because there are at least two feedings and neither patient nor operator knows which challenges contain the food being tested.</p><p>The procedure for DBPCFC is more labor intensive than the open- or single-blind challenge, but it can still be carried out in an office setting if the required materials and personnel are available. The aid of a third party is needed to prepare the challenges. A coin flip can be used by the third party to randomize the order of administration. It is sometimes difficult to provide a meal-sized portion of a food in its natural state because the food is masked.</p><p>The false-negative rate for DBPCFCs is 0.7 percent, and the false-positive rate is 2.8 to 3.2 percent, based primarily upon studies in children with atopic dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-42</a>]. Worsening eczema was the most frequent clinical reaction in one series, and reactions to placebo were more common in children &le;1.5 years of age compared with older children (4 versus 1.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>The placebo arm and active arm may be performed in a single day in patients with a history of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions. There should be several hours between challenges. The practice of interspersing placebo and active food proteins during a single challenge (ie, random ordering of sequential doses of placebo and suspected allergen) should be discouraged because it may be difficult to differentiate whether a reaction following a placebo dose was due to the placebo or other factor or was a delayed reaction to the suspected allergen.</p><p>As noted above, an open feeding of a meal-sized portion of the tested food prepared in its usual manner is often performed as a follow-up to any negative DBPCFC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. A DBPCFC may need to be repeated using larger doses or different methods of food preparation if such an open feeding induces a reaction. Although DBPCFCs typically include only two separate challenges (a single placebo and only one active feeding component), increasing the number of challenges to both placebo and active allergen helps to diminish the possibility of a reaction due to chance rather than true allergy; however, this approach is very labor intensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">PERFORMANCE OF AN OFC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In all challenges, the food is given in gradually increasing amounts. Consensus has not been reached on a uniform international protocol for performing OFCs, although suggestions for standardization have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/6,37,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,37,45</a>]. The protocol for OFC (eg, dosing, time between doses) may need to be varied to match clinical issues (eg, the history of the reaction pattern).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Informed consent should be obtained from the patient or guardian and documented prior to beginning the challenge.</p><p>Patients should avoid the suspected food(s) for at least two weeks before the OFC for suspected immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy and several weeks longer for non-IgE-mediated reactions. Patients should not eat or drink for at least two hours prior to challenge.</p><p>Antihistamines, beta-agonists, beta-adrenergic blockers (including eye drops), and other medications that may either alter symptoms of a reaction or interfere with its treatment should be discontinued for at least five half-lives (specific to each medication) prior to challenge. Patients should be instructed to bring their autoinjectable <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> to their appointment so that it is available to them on the trip home after the test in the event of a delayed reaction.</p><p>Patients are advised to cancel the OFC if they are experiencing acute allergic symptoms or are otherwise ill at the time of their appointment. Patients with asthma should be symptom free and be stable on current therapy with no recent exacerbations. Spirometry may be performed to ensure a good baseline. Infrequently, hospitalization may be necessary to treat severe or acute allergic disease and establish a stable baseline prior to challenges.</p><p>Children may be more cooperative if they are supplied with videos, games, and other distractions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OFCs are almost always performed under direct medical supervision either in a clinic or hospital setting. Options for location include clinician offices, outpatient centers designed for procedures, inpatient hospital units, and monitored intensive care units. In unusual circumstances, foods may be gradually added back into the diet at home. This may be undertaken when specific IgE tests are negative, symptoms are mild or chronic, and there is little concern for potential anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergy in children: Prevalence, natural history, and monitoring for resolution&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Selection of an appropriate setting requires clinician judgment about risks and availability of advanced treatment of anaphylaxis.

The clinician must have appropriate training and be prepared with emergency medications and equipment to promptly treat such a reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/1,22,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22,47,48</a>]. Intravenous access for rapid fluid resuscitation should be readily available for patients with food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) undergoing a food challenge since they are at risk for hypotension with re-exposure to the food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

In contrast, in a review of positive food challenges performed in children expected to react (performed for screening for interventional studies), epinephrine was used for 39 percent of 74 reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective series reviewed 584 OFCs performed in children who were estimated to have a &le;50 percent risk of a reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Forty-three percent of the challenges were positive. Thirty-nine percent of the reactions were mild, 33 percent moderate, and 28 percent severe. The type and incidence of the different reactions were cutaneous (78 percent), gastrointestinal (43 percent), oral (26 percent), lower respiratory (26 percent), and upper respiratory (25 percent). No children had cardiovascular symptoms. There was no difference among foods in the severity of positive challenges or the type of treatment required to reverse symptoms, despite presumptions about certain foods causing more severe reactions than others (eg, peanut compared with egg or milk). All reactions were reversed with antihistamines without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, beta agonists, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> glucocorticoids. Patients were observed for a minimum of four hours after completion of the challenge, and none had a delayed reaction after discharge.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another series reviewed 150 food challenges performed in 109 patients aged six months to 18 years at a university-based pediatric allergy clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Challenges were performed to either confirm an allergy or determine if an allergy had resolved. Patients with a history of severe cardiovascular symptoms were excluded from this series. The median IgE level at the time of the challenge was 1.22 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span> for milk, 0.96 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span> for peanut, and 0.65 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span> for egg. There were 40 (27 percent) positive challenges (milk, 4 of 39; peanut, 12 of 37; egg, 13 of 29; other, 11 of 45). Only three patients were graded as having severe reactions because they had wheezing. All other positive challenges were mild to moderate in severity and included skin, upper respiratory, and gastrointestinal manifestations. Reaction severity did not correlate with specific IgE level. Thirty-five percent of positive challenges were managed with observation only, and 57 percent were treated with an antihistamine. No challenges induced cardiovascular symptoms or required treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Food preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In blinded challenges, the allergenic food is hidden in another food.</p><p>Opaque capsules have been used but are now in disfavor because they pose several potential problems. Some patients, especially young children, are unable to ingest enough capsules or even swallow them at all. In addition, capsules can bypass oral contact, which would normally provide the earliest <span class=\"nowrap\">symptoms/clues</span> of a clinical response. Finally, slow degradation of capsules may result in overlapping doses (ie, administration of a subsequent dose before the previous dose was fully released). This can lead to unintended administration of a higher-than-needed dose to elicit symptoms and to more severe reactions.</p><p>Thus, allergenic foods may be mixed into masking foods. Equipment used for food preparation includes paper plates, cups, disposable utensils, mixing bowls, scale, <span class=\"nowrap\">mortar/pestle,</span> blender, and a microwave. Suggestions for masking foods are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F64516\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64516 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. The following points should also be considered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is often easier to mask liquid into liquid or to use powdered or dehydrated forms of foods that can be folded into solid vehicles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a gritty allergen is being hidden in a vehicle, then a similarly gritty food should be added as placebo to the carrier vehicle. For example, for a challenge with ground oats hidden in applesauce, cornmeal may be mixed into applesauce as a placebo.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is preferable not to use fatty foods as vehicles, since they can delay gastric absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain flavoring agents, such as mint, tuna, or garlic, can mask odors (such as the odor of peanut butter). However, it is important to select vehicles that are clearly tolerated by the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measuring small amounts (eg, fractions of a mg) may be difficult and inaccurate; mixing and diluting the food in a carrier vehicle is often a more practical approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain preparation methods (eg, canning, dehydration) may alter allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. For this reason, a negative challenge should always be followed by an open feeding of the food, prepared in the way it is normally ingested. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Discontinuing a challenge'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Dosing and timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No single approach to dosing and timing is universally established for food challenges. Dose amounts and timing between doses should be adjusted to match the patient's history (eg, if days of ingestion are needed to elicit symptoms) or concerns about heightened sensitivity (eg, starting with minimal doses spaced out over longer periods of observation).</p><p>For example, a child with a history of atopic dermatitis flaring over days with milk ingestion, who carries positive IgE tests to milk and has been avoiding this protein for a year, may have an acute allergic reaction on the day of challenge or may experience a flare over days of ingestion. A graded OFC under clinician supervision on the first day would evaluate the risk of an acute reaction and, if tolerated, following the child's symptoms over the following days with milk added to the diet, would evaluate for delayed responses.</p><p>The general approach is to select a regimen that is unlikely to result in a severe acute reaction by cautiously and gradually increasing the amount ingested (with the target cumulative dose of a meal-sized portion), while also considering time constraints.</p><p>For patients with past food reactions that occurred immediately after ingestion, doses are generally administered at 10- to 30-minute intervals over approximately 90 minutes, followed by a larger, meal-sized portion of food a few hours later.</p><p>Different dosing regimens are suggested when performing OFC for FPIES. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Total dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One approach used for double-blind, placebo-controlled, OFCs (DBPCFCs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/1,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,59</a>] is to administer a total of 8 to 10 grams of the dry food or 100 mL of <span class=\"nowrap\">wet/liquid</span> food (double amount for <span class=\"nowrap\">meat/fish,</span> eg, 20 grams). Dry forms of peanut (flour), milk, and egg are often used. The grams used may not match the protein content of ingested foods in their natural form. Powdered forms with a weight of 8 to 10 grams are approximately equivalent to 105 mL skim milk, 1.2 eggs, and 21 mL of peanut butter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Starting dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The starting dose should be low enough that it does not trigger a reaction in most patients. Estimation of a starting dose may differ based on estimation of the risk of reaction based on history and testing. According to a workgroup report, the challenge may begin with 0.1 to 1 percent of the total challenge food, which may represent 1 to 5 mg of the food protein and 8 to 10 mg of the whole food, depending on the type of food and its preparation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology proposed starting doses as follows (shown as protein weight or liquid volume): peanut 0.1 mg, milk 0.1 mL, egg 1 mg, cod 5 mg, wheat 100 mg, soy 1 mg, shrimp 5 mg, hazelnut 0.1 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Another consensus report suggested starting with 3 mg of food protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Starting doses of 100 mg or less are recommended in part based upon results from a series of 513 positive challenges to six common allergenic foods in children with atopic dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In this series, starting doses ranged from 100 to 500 mg. Neither prick skin test size nor specific IgE antibody concentration was predictive of the dose required to trigger a reaction. Eleven percent of the reactions that occurred on first dose were severe. The following results were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 50 percent of children reacted at the first dose for egg and milk; 25 percent for soy, wheat, and peanut; and 15 percent for fish.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twenty-two percent of milk challenges and 8 percent of egg challenges were positive at a first dose of 250 mg.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three percent of milk and egg challenges were positive at a first dose of 100 mg.</p><p/><p>One could argue for starting doses that begin under the thresholds reported to induce reaction, especially in patients who have a history of reacting to trace amounts of a food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. However, threshold data are not available for most foods, and the thresholds that are published vary logarithmically. Reactions are usually not reported under 0.25 mg of protein for peanut (1 mg of peanut, an amount about the size of the head of a pin), 0.13 mg for egg (similar to the weight and volume of peanut butter), and 0.6 mg for milk (approximately 0.02 mL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. These doses are difficult to measure accurately with typical office equipment.</p><p>Labial food challenge (placing the food on the lower lip for two minutes and observing for local or systemic reactions in the ensuing 30 minutes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>] has been suggested by some as a starting point before an OFC.

As an example, for a milk challenge with the target dose of 100 mL (1 mL = 1 percent of the total dose), the doses could be: 1, 4, 10, 20, 20, 20, and 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, a variety of other challenge regimens have been used, including lower starting doses, variations in the dosing increments, and different time intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A reaction occurring after a dose may represent symptoms due to just that dose or to the cumulative effect of previous doses given [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be examined carefully prior to an OFC to determine their baseline and to confirm that they do not have any current significant allergic <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms</span> or an illness that would interfere with assessment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment of a reaction during the challenge. Vital signs are measured, and signs and symptoms are recorded at baseline, prior to each dose, and at set intervals after the final dose. Assessments are made for symptoms affecting the skin, cardiovascular system, and gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77080\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77080 \">table 3</a>). Scoring systems are useful in the research setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/37,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,64</a>] but are not generally implemented in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Children may become suddenly quiet or assume a fetal position prior to exhibiting more objective symptoms. Early indications of a reaction can include subtle signs, such as moving the tongue in the mouth to rub an itchy palate or ear pulling as an indication of pruritus. Oropharyngeal pruritus or pain often precedes objective symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>].

Expert judgment is needed about whether or not to discontinue a challenge if symptoms are not clear. Generally, a challenge is discontinued if subjective symptoms are repetitive or prolonged.</p><p>Following a negative OFC in which the allergen was administered in a form not normally eaten (eg, peanut flour or powdered egg), it is essential to perform an open challenge with a meal-sized portion of the food in the state in which it is normally ingested (eg, peanut butter or boiled egg). This is done to ensure that the processing of the allergenic food for challenge did not alter the allergen and to confirm the negative result.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical treatment for a reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medications are given as needed to treat allergic or anaphylactic reactions. Generally, antihistamines are given at the earliest sign of a reaction. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Epinephrine</a> and other treatments are given if there is progression of symptoms or any potentially life-threatening symptoms.

It is possible to have later-onset symptoms, and we extend this period if the history suggests delayed reactions (especially for suspected delayed reactions to mammalian meats) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>] or if prior reactions were severe. We inform the patient not to eat more of the test food that day and to report and treat any symptoms. The food is added to the diet the next day if no delayed symptoms are reported.</p><p>Following a positive challenge, we observe patients for a minimum of two hours past resolution of mild symptoms that required minimal treatment and at least four hours for more significant reactions.

Typically, the food is started in the diet in normal portions the day after the challenge. Some patients and parents may continue to be fearful about eating the food, despite a negative challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>], and this can result in continued avoidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Patients and parents should be counseled that delayed reactions or reactions to a normal serving size of the food eaten all at once can occur, usually within a few days of the challenge, but they should also be reassured that these reactions are rare. As noted above regarding peanut, avoidance or infrequent exposure may result in resensitization to the allergen. It is therefore important to encourage normal incorporation of the food into the diet. Patients should be asked at subsequent visits about regular ingestion of the former allergen. A repeat challenge may be required in patients who have continued to avoid the food.</p><p>Patients who have had a negative OFC to one allergen may have remaining food allergies. These patients must be cautioned specifically about cross-contamination by foods that are commonly associated with the food that they are now able to ingest.</p><p>Some patients may wish to continue carrying <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> even when there are no remaining food allergies.
