Many patients are asymptomatic, while others have symptoms referable to the aneurysm such as pain with ambulation (claudication) or acute limb ischemia due to aneurysm thrombosis or distal embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

These patients can be managed in a manner similar to patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease if symptoms (eg, claudication) develop, with surgical bypass reserved only for disabling symptoms or critical limb ischemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=popliteal-artery-aneurysm#H1231035351\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Popliteal artery aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Asymptomatic patients'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=popliteal-artery-aneurysm#H1314527\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Popliteal artery aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Chronic ischemia'</a>.)</p><p>Although most patients with appropriate indications for repair are candidates for open or endovascular repair, patients who are nonambulatory and those with prohibitive risks for intervention should be treated conservatively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=popliteal-artery-aneurysm#H20038379\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Popliteal artery aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Indications for repair'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with acutely thrombosed popliteal aneurysms who have persistently poor (or no) runoff through the tibial vessels in spite of thrombolysis (preoperative or intraoperative) may be poor candidates for popliteal artery repair. In one retrospective review, poor runoff (as measured by runoff score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]) was one of only two variables associated with loss of graft patency; ongoing smoking was the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, in this study, nearly one-half of the grafts used were synthetic. In another review in which only vein grafts were used, the outcome did not correlate with runoff anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thus, in patients with acutely thrombosed popliteal aneurysms, poor runoff following thrombolysis may be a relative contraindication to popliteal artery aneurysm repair if a suitable vein conduit is not available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=popliteal-artery-aneurysm#H16064863\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Popliteal artery aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Role of antithrombotic therapy and thrombolysis'</a> and <a href=\"#H1231031621\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1231031448\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY OF THE POPLITEAL FOSSA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The popliteal fossa is a diamond-shaped space located posterior to the knee joint. The superior and inferior margins are defined by the supracondylar line of the femur and soleal line of the tibia, respectively. From a posterior view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F62362\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62362 \">figure 2</a>), the space is bounded above the knee by the biceps femoris tendon which inserts laterally, and semimembranous tendon which inserts medially. Below the knee, the medial and lateral margins are formed by the insertions of the medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius muscle. </p><p>The popliteal fossa contains the popliteal artery, popliteal veins, and tibial nerve. The popliteal artery is the continuation of the superficial femoral artery. Anatomic landmarks demarcating the popliteal artery include the tendinous insertion of the adductor magnus muscle in the distal femur superiorly, and the bifurcation of the popliteal artery into the anterior tibial artery and tibioperoneal trunk at the level of the tibial tuberosity inferiorly. Anatomic variations of the distal popliteal artery include a high origin of the anterior tibial artery, trifurcation of the vessel into the anterior tibial, peroneal, and posterior tibial arteries (ie, no tibioperoneal trunk), and a hypoplastic or aplastic posterior tibial artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Collateral flow around the knee is critical in maintaining lower extremity perfusion when a popliteal aneurysm thromboses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72956\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72956 \">figure 3</a>). Collateral pathways are provided by the superior and inferior genicular (medial and lateral), anterior recurrent tibial, and descending genicular arteries. </p><p>The popliteal vein is typically paired, traveling adjacent the popliteal artery with numerous interconnections (venae comitantes); one of the veins usually predominates in size. The popliteal vein originates at the confluence of the anterior and posterior tibial veins; the peroneal veins empty into it more superiorly. The popliteal vein becomes the femoral vein at the adductor canal.</p><p>The tibial nerve is derived from the sciatic nerve. In the popliteal fossa, the tibial nerve gives off muscular branches (ie, gastrocnemius, popliteus, soleus, plantaris), and a sensory branch (ie, soleal nerve) that innervates the lateral aspect of the foot. The tibial nerve traverses distally in the leg along the surface of the soleus muscle supplying the muscles that plantar flex the foot.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1231031455\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to open surgical or endovascular repair of the popliteal artery, the patient's clinical condition, medical comorbidities and vascular anatomy, including the presence of other large vessel aneurysms, are evaluated. These factors influence the timing of repair and the choice between open surgical or endovascular repair of the popliteal aneurysm. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604915778\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Popliteal aneurysm is often asymptomatic, but many patients have symptoms referable to the aneurysm, with symptoms ranging from pain with walking (ie, intermittent claudication) to symptoms of acute limb ischemia due to acute aneurysm thrombosis, or distal embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=popliteal-artery-aneurysm#H1231035344\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Popliteal artery aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute lower extremity ischemia&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentations'</a>.)</p><p>Asymptomatic patients and those with viable limbs that are not threatened (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75112\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75112 \">table 1</a>) can undergo outpatient preoperative evaluation and repair. For patients who present acutely with a threatened extremity, urgent or emergent inpatient evaluation and repair are undertaken. In patients with acute thrombosis, an intravenous heparin infusion should be initiated to limit the extension of thrombus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=popliteal-artery-aneurysm#H16064863\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Popliteal artery aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Role of antithrombotic therapy and thrombolysis'</a>.)</p><p>Limb salvage rates following repair of popliteal artery aneurysm (open surgical or endovascular) correlate with an increasing number of patent tibial outflow vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/1,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,9</a>]. To improve outflow, thrombolytic therapy (catheter-directed or intraoperative) or thromboembolectomy are routinely performed. Catheter-directed thrombolysis is less appropriate for immediately-threatened extremities because length of time needed to dissolve the clot is usually prolonged (12 to 24 hours). (See <a href=\"#H542106921\" class=\"local\">'Open versus endovascular repair'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604915890\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging the patient's vascular anatomy is necessary prior to repair. Arterial imaging with computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) angiography, or invasive arteriography assesses the suitability for endovascular repair, evaluates proximal and distal arterial patency and may identify coexisting aneurysm. Although duplex ultrasound may identify the presence of an aneurysm, it does not show sufficient detail to plan a repair but is essential for mapping the venous system to identify suitable veins to serve as a bypass conduit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease#H58544718\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive diagnosis of arterial disease&quot;, section on 'Ultrasound'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease#H58544732\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive diagnosis of arterial disease&quot;, section on 'Advanced imaging'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H601500443\"><span class=\"h3\">Suitability for endovascular repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tortuosity and extent of aneurysm and the presence of adequate stent-graft landing zones should be carefully evaluated. At least 15 to 20 mm of normal artery should be available proximal and distal to the aneurysm to obtain adequate stent-graft fixation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Clinicians should review the instruction for use (IFU) for the particular endovascular device being used. (See <a href=\"#H1231031579\" class=\"local\">'Endovascular aneurysm repair'</a> below.)</p><p>The aneurysm may be limited to the popliteal fossa or extend proximally to the distal superficial femoral artery or distally to popliteal artery bifurcation. Focal aneurysms more typically have normal appearing proximal and distal popliteal artery segments, but popliteal artery aneurysms are frequently associated with diffuse arteriomegaly. Focal aneurysms are amenable to a short bypass or placement of a single stent-graft. Angulation may be present (most commonly at the adductor canal) if the aneurysm extends proximally into the superficial femoral artery. Although mild angulation may straighten with a stent, severe angulation (&gt;45 degrees) is likely to cause future kinking of the stent and open surgical repair may be more appropriate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H601500472\"><span class=\"h3\">Proximal and distal circulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low flow due to proximal stenosis or occlusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreased outflow from a <span class=\"nowrap\">stenotic/thrombosed</span> popliteal artery or occluded tibial vessels decreases patency rates of open surgical and endovascular repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/9,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,12</a>]. Restoration of arterial inflow with stenting or bypass <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> restoration of arterial outflow with <span class=\"nowrap\">thrombectomy/thrombolysis</span> should be performed prior to, or at the same setting as, popliteal aneurysm repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic limb-threatening ischemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease is present in a significant proportion of patients with popliteal artery aneurysm and should be managed concomitant with popliteal artery aneurysm to improve the outcomes of repair. In one retrospective review, 40 percent of patients had severe atherosclerosis of the femoral artery. Atherosclerosis-related occlusion of the superficial femoral artery was present in 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Tibial vessel occlusion in patients with popliteal artery aneurysm is most likely due to thromboembolism. Thrombolytic therapy (catheter-directed or direct intraoperative) may restore patency of the anterior tibial, posterior tibial, or peroneal arteries in patients presenting with acute ischemia, thus improving the likelihood of a successful popliteal artery aneurysm repair. Patients with acutely thrombosed popliteal artery aneurysms who have poor runoff in spite of thrombolysis may be poor candidates for popliteal artery aneurysm repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=popliteal-artery-aneurysm#H16064863\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Popliteal artery aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Role of antithrombotic therapy and thrombolysis'</a> and <a href=\"#H1231031441\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604916299\"><span class=\"h3\">Coexistent aneurysms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Popliteal aneurysm is a marker for a large artery aneurysm diathesis. An estimated 75 percent of patients with a popliteal aneurysm will have another aneurysm at a separate site (contralateral popliteal artery, femoral arteries, abdominal aorta, iliac arteries) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=popliteal-artery-aneurysm#H1231035388\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Popliteal artery aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The presence of other aneurysms (aortic, iliac, or femoral) influences the timing and nature of the popliteal aneurysm repair. Generally, for asymptomatic patients, aneurysms proximal to the popliteal aneurysm should be managed first, if indicated, as these have a potential to embolize distally and may occlude the popliteal bypass or stent. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604916154\"><span class=\"h3\">Availability of conduit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term patency rates are higher when autogenous vein rather than prosthetic graft is used for lower extremity bypass below the knee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14</a>], and thus, the availability of vein may determine the approach to popliteal aneurysm repair. The diameter, length, and patency of the great saphenous vein ipsilateral and contralateral to the popliteal aneurysm should be evaluated. The ipsilateral saphenous vein may be preferred in patients with bilateral aneurysms and in those with more extensive popliteal aneurysms (ie, requiring a long bypass). The femoral vein is an acceptable conduit if great saphenous vein is not available bilaterally and the patient is not a candidate for endovascular repair.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1231031484\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical risk assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk factors for popliteal artery aneurysm are similar to those of other major vascular aneurysms (ie, abdominal aortic, iliac, and femoral aneurysms) and include smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cerebrovascular disease, and coronary heart disease, among others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, in contrast to atherosclerotic occlusive disease, diabetes mellitus is associated with a decreased risk for aneurysmal disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=popliteal-artery-aneurysm#H1231035337\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Popliteal artery aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.).</p><p>Because of these associations, a complete medical history with particular attention to risk factors for cardiovascular disease should be obtained, since comorbidities may impact the choice of repair. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of cardiac risk for noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Prior to elective repair, the patient should be referred to a smoking cessation program. Active smoking at the time of surgery is associated with an increased risk for pulmonary complications and is an independent risk factor for bypass graft failure.

Open surgical bypass and endovascular stent-grafting each accomplish these goals. Whether an open surgical or endovascular approach is preferred is the subject of much debate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Clinical practice varies widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Limited data are available comparing popliteal artery aneurysm repair techniques, and major society guidelines provide no guidance in choosing between open surgical versus endovascular repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/2,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17</a>]. We advocate an individualized approach taking into account the clinical presentation (elective versus emergent), the degree of limb ischemia, the patient's medical comorbidities, and their vascular anatomy (suitability for endograft, status of the <span class=\"nowrap\">proximal/distal</span> circulation, coexistent aneurysm, availability of vein conduit) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>The benefit of endovascular stent-grafting may be the greatest in patients with indications for elective repair who have a high perioperative risk for surgery. We suggest endovascular repair in these patients provided the popliteal segment is suitable for endograft placement (see <a href=\"#H601500443\" class=\"local\">'Suitability for endovascular repair'</a> above). Compared with endovascular repair, open repair is associated with increased mortality, particularly in patients with medical comorbidities, although some have argued that the outcomes of studies comparing open and endovascular repair may be biased since open repair of popliteal artery aneurysm is more commonly used for managing patients with acute popliteal aneurysm thrombosis. Nevertheless, we feel that avoiding the risks associated with anesthesia and potentially the need for transfusion in high-risk patients is highly desirable. (See <a href=\"#H1231031621\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p>Whether patients with indications for elective repair who are <strong>not</strong> at high risk for open surgery should undergo open surgical or endovascular repair is more controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. For these patients, we suggest open surgical repair, provided the patient has adequate vein conduit. If adequate vein is not available, an endovascular approach is an acceptable alternative. Open surgical repair is the accepted standard and is a durable procedure that has been shown in retrospective studies to be associated with low perioperative morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/8,15,19,21,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15,19,21,24,25</a>]. A database review from the Vascular Quality Initiative suggested better outcomes for elective open compared with endovascular repair (asymptomatic patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]; however, some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], but not all, retrospective reviews have found no significant differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Early graft failure is uncommon with open repair, and long-term rates for limb loss are low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Systematic reviews have identified one randomized trial comparing open surgical and endovascular repair of popliteal aneurysms (not acutely thrombosed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/18,21,28,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21,28,30-32</a>]. In this trial, although there were no significant differences in the overall patency of popliteal bypass grafts compared with endovascular stent-grafts, endovascular repair had a significantly increased risk of early (30-day) reintervention (OR 18.8, 95% CI 1.4-245.9) and a trend toward early (30-day) graft thrombosis. The main advantage of endovascular repair was a shorter length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference -3.9 days, 95% CI -4.3 to -3.4). An update of this randomized trial assessed longer-term outcomes in 27 open and 21 endovascular repairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Primary patency rates in patients undergoing open popliteal aneurysm repair compared with endovascular repair were not significantly different at 12- or 72-month follow-up. Secondary patency rates at 72 months were 88 and 86 percent for open and endovascular repair, respectively. The latest systematic review, including the randomized trial and 13 other observational studies, evaluated the outcomes of 4880 cases (1210 endovascular, 3915 open surgical) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Primary patency at one year was significantly better for open repair (88.3 versus 71.2 percent at one year [11 studies], and 79.4 versus 68.2 percent at three years [6 studies]), but there were no differences for secondary patency rates (92.3 versus 86.3 percent at one year [9 studies], and 86.6 versus 80 percent at three years [5 studies]). Open repair was more likely to be performed in younger patients and those with worse tibial runoff compared with those who underwent endovascular repair. This meta-analysis found that while endovascular repair had a lower wound complication rate and shorter length of stay, it comes at the cost of inferior primary patency, but not secondary patency out to three years.</p><p>Other factors need to be taken into consideration in patients undergoing popliteal artery aneurysm repair for emergent indications (acute thrombosis, rupture). Thrombolytic therapy is appropriate for thrombosed popliteal artery aneurysms causing acute limb ischemia to improve outflow, provided the limb is not immediately threatened. Patients with an immediately-threatened limb are treated with an open surgical approach that includes thromboembolectomy and intraoperative infusion of lytic agents rather than using a percutaneous method of thrombolysis due to the prolonged time needed to lyse a heavy burden of thrombus that could further compromise the extremity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/9,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,34,35</a>].

There are no randomized data to support one approach over the other. In a systematic review of observational studies involving 1427 repairs (338 posterior, 1089 medial), although primary patency rates favored a posterior approach, there were no significant differences between the approaches for long-term patency, amputation rates, or complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>In one retrospective review of 571 patients, 87 percent were managed with a medial approach and 8 percent with a posterior approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In another review of 234 open surgical repairs, a posterior approach was used in 71 patients, and in the remaining 163, a medial approach was preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Aneurysmal ligation and bypass grafting was used in 122 interventions, aneurysmectomy with graft interposition was used in 108, and four patients underwent aneurysmectomy with an end-to-end anastomosis. An autologous vein was used in 49 interventions, and a prosthetic graft was used in 181. Primary vein graft patency rates were not significantly different between the medial and posterior approach (85 versus 90 percent). (See <a href=\"#H604915890\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H542106921\" class=\"local\">'Open versus endovascular repair'</a> above.)</p><p>Patency rates notwithstanding, anatomic considerations may indicate a preference for one approach over the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>]. When an initial surgical approach is indicated in patients with acutely thrombosed popliteal aneurysms (ie, threatened limb), or there is evidence of embolization of the tibial vessels, we suggest a medial approach which facilitates thromboembolectomy or intraoperative thrombolytic therapy. Graft patency is improved when the burden of thrombus is minimized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/1,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,9</a>]. It may be more difficult to effectively clear thrombus using a posterior approach. On the other hand, for patients with focal aneurysms confined to the popliteal fossa, we suggest a posterior approach, which minimizes the length of the graft required (see <a href=\"#H1231031565\" class=\"local\">'In-line reconstruction'</a> below).

(See <a href=\"#H1231031448\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy of the popliteal fossa'</a> above.)</p><p>The conduit of choice for lower extremity bypass is ipsilateral great saphenous vein (reversed or nonreversed).

Below-the-knee prosthetic (polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]) grafts have an increased risk of thrombosis and are avoided, whenever possible, for the repair of popliteal artery aneurysm. In one single institution review, primary patency at 24 months for saphenous vein was 95 percent compared with 79 percent for PTFE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Anatomic placement allows a straighter graft with less potential for kinking around the knee and may be more suitable for patients with muscular legs; however, the popliteal graft segment may be more difficult to appreciate on ultrasound surveillance. (See <a href=\"#H1231031614\" class=\"local\">'Graft surveillance'</a> below.)</p><p>Extensive aneurysmal degeneration or atherosclerotic disease that affects the superficial femoral artery proximally, or popliteal artery distally (ie, at the origin of the anterior tibial artery) necessitates originating a bypass graft from the common femoral artery or extending the graft distally to one of the tibial vessels, respectively. Aggressive distal bypass to the tibial vessels may be important for optimizing outcomes. In a retrospective review of 51 popliteal aneurysm repairs (37 elective; 14 emergent), overall primary patency rates at one-year and five-years follow-up were 96 and 85 percent, and secondary patency rates were 100 and 97 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

As such, most surgeons would not approach a thrombosed popliteal aneurysm posteriorly, particularly if outflow is compromised.</p><p>With the posterior approach, a vein or prosthetic graft is used to reconstruct the popliteal artery. In a retrospective review of 571 patients, 45 of whom were managed with a posterior approach, vein graft and PTFE had similar one-year patency rates (85 and 81 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. A 'lazy' S-shaped incision is made over the popliteal fossa to minimize problems with scar contracture. After gaining vascular control, the popliteal artery is opened and the graft sutured to normal artery proximally and distally. Upon completion of the repair, the aneurysm sac is closed over the graft, provided enough arterial wall remains (similar to other aneurysm repairs).

This complication usually occurs later in the postoperative course. In one retrospective review, perfusion of the aneurysm sac was identified at a median of six years after primary repair (range 1 to 20 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Rupture of the residual popliteal aneurysm has been reported. If the residual sac continues to expand or the patient becomes symptomatic, the vessel(s) providing flow into the excluded aneurysm need(s) to be identified and ligated. This is usually accomplished using a posterior approach. The aneurysm sac is identified and opened, and the branches are ligated from within the sac.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because of the nature of the open posterior approach, in-line reconstruction is associated with a much lower risk of postoperative sac expansion compared with the medial approach. In one retrospective review of 571 patients, the risk of expansion following posterior repair was 8 percent compared with 33 percent for the medial approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aneurysm <span class=\"nowrap\">extension/vein</span> graft aneurysm &ndash; Aneurysmal degeneration of the arterial wall may continue following aneurysm repair.

More aggressive uses of endovascular stent-grafts include multiple stents for the repair of more extensive aneurysms that involve the superficial femoral artery, and stenting of ruptured popliteal artery aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>Early stents-grafts for the repair of popliteal artery aneurysm were homemade and fashioned from balloon-expandable stents attached to a 6 mm polytetrafluoroethylene graft (PTFE), and on occasion, this type of graft may still be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

Patients who have evidence of prior embolization may benefit from thrombolytic therapy. Inadequate restoration of flow in continuity with the popliteal artery precludes placement of a stent-graft. These patients will require bypass to one of the tibial vessels. (See <a href=\"#H1231031542\" class=\"local\">'Surgical bypass'</a> above.)</p><p>A soft guidewire is advanced through the popliteal aneurysm into one of the tibial vessels. The initial wire is replaced with a catheter through which a stiffer wire is placed. An adequate diameter and longer sheath is placed to protect the stent-graft as it is passed to the aneurysm site. The device is advanced over the stiff wire and additional imaging performed to ensure accurate placement of the device. The stent-graft should overlap the proximal and distal normal artery by at least 1 cm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68952\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68952 \">figure 6</a>). Care is taken to avoid points of vessel flexion to avoid kinking the stent which can potentially lead to stent-graft thrombosis. Some studies have shown that the primary site of arterial flexion occurs at the superior margin of the patella [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. When multiple stents are needed, stent overlap in this region needs to be long enough to ensure that kinking does not occur and that components do not separate. (See <a href=\"#H601500443\" class=\"local\">'Suitability for endovascular repair'</a> above.)</p><p>Once the proper position is confirmed, the graft is deployed from its sheath and an appropriately sized balloon is inflated within the proximal and distal graft to ensure an adequate seal.

Endoleak most commonly develops at the stent-graft fixation points (type I). If a type I endoleak is identified at the time of completion arteriography, additional balloon angioplasty or stent-graft placement is performed to remedy the leak. With time, arterial wall aneurysmal degeneration may change the configuration of the popliteal aneurysm, potentially leading to stent-graft migration and a delayed type I leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

For these patients, we further suggest using a medial approach, which facilitates thromboembolectomy or intraoperative thrombolytic therapy, rather than a posterior approach (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom popliteal artery aneurysm stenting is scheduled or anticipated, we recommend periprocedural antiplatelet therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For those patients not on chronic aspirin therapy, we give aspirin 325 to 650 mg daily starting at least 48 hours before the procedure or, if within 48 hours of the procedure, a loading dose of aspirin 650 mg given at least four hours before the procedure. Following popliteal artery aneurysm stenting for patients in whom the risk of bleeding is low, we suggest dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) for at least four weeks (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1231031607\" class=\"local\">'Antiplatelet therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following open or endovascular repair of popliteal artery aneurysm, duplex ultrasound surveillance should be performed postoperatively to establish a baseline, and then at six months postoperatively to identify areas of stenosis in the graft or stent-graft, aneurysm sac enlargement, and for endovascular repair, endoleak, or stent-graft fracture. Thereafter, duplex surveillance is obtained annually unless symptoms develop. (See <a href=\"#H1231031614\" class=\"local\">'Graft surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The outcomes of popliteal artery aneurysm repair (eg, graft patency, limb salvage, mortality) are affected by the nature of the presenting symptoms and signs, type of repair, quality of distal runoff, and risk factors for aneurysmal disease progression (eg, smoking) and type of repair. (See <a href=\"#H1231031621\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above.) </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Pulli R, Dorigo W, Troisi N, et al.
