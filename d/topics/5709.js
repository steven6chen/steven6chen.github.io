The Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies are caused by mutations of the dystrophin gene and are therefore named dystrophinopathies. Weakness is the principal symptom as muscle fiber degeneration is the primary pathologic process.</p><p>The dystrophinopathies are inherited as X-linked recessive traits and have varying clinical characteristics. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is associated with the most severe clinical symptoms. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) has a similar presentation to DMD but a relatively milder clinical course.</p><p>Glucocorticoid treatment and potential disease-modifying therapies for Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy will be discussed in this review.

In addition, the average time to climb four stairs was approximately 43 percent faster with prednisone treatment compared with placebo (4 versus 7 seconds, respectively). In this and other trials, strength increased significantly by 10 days, reached a maximum at 3 months, and was maintained at 6 months and 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-glucocorticoid-and-disease-modifying-treatment/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a trial of 28 patients with DMD, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deflazacort-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deflazacort</a> treatment for nine months was associated with increased muscle strength and function compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-glucocorticoid-and-disease-modifying-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

These studies reported comparable improvements in muscle function, pulmonary function, and orthopedic outcomes for prednisone and deflazacort treatment. Side effect profiles of prednisone and deflazacort were also similar in most of these reports. In one nonrandomized observational study of 340 patients with DMD, deflazacort was associated with a later loss of ambulation and increased frequency of adverse effects (but not weight gain) compared with <span class=\"nowrap\">prednisone/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-glucocorticoid-and-disease-modifying-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In a small trial, prednisone administered at 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per week given over two weekend days was equivalent to daily dosing at 0.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> for preserving muscle strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-glucocorticoid-and-disease-modifying-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, in an extension of a randomized trial, alternate day therapy with prednisone (1.25 and 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every other day) was <strong>not</strong> sufficient to achieve the sustained benefit associated with daily prednisone ranging from 0.3 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-glucocorticoid-and-disease-modifying-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deflazacort-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Deflazacort</a> is generally dosed at 0.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-glucocorticoid-and-disease-modifying-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There is limited evidence from a small placebo-controlled trial that alternate day dosing of deflazacort (2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every other day) is also effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-glucocorticoid-and-disease-modifying-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deflazacort-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Deflazacort</a> is an oxazoline derivative of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>; the relative potency of prednisone compared with deflazacort is 1:1.3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-glucocorticoid-and-disease-modifying-treatment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Thus, 1.3 mg of deflazacort is approximately equivalent to 1.0 mg of prednisone. Deflazacort was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-glucocorticoid-and-disease-modifying-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. It is available in Canada via the Special Access Programme (SAP), which provides access to nonmarketed drugs for practitioners treating patients with serious or life-threatening conditions when conventional therapies have failed, are unsuitable, or unavailable.

Other potential adverse effects of glucocorticoids include decreased linear growth and short stature, delayed puberty, long bone and vertebral bone fractures, acne, gastrointestinal symptoms, cataracts, and behavioral changes.

The glucocorticoid dose can be reduced by 25 to 35 percent if the side effects are intolerable or unmanageable, with reassessment in one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-glucocorticoid-and-disease-modifying-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The dose can be lowered by an additional 25 percent if intolerable side effects persist. A gradual tapering of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> to as low as 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day may give significant but less robust benefit.</p><p>In patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy, abrupt cessation or rapid withdrawal of glucocorticoids should be avoided because it can result in adrenal insufficiency. In the setting of acute illness, trauma, or surgery, stress-dose glucocorticoid therapy may be needed.

Similarly, another trial of 18 patients found that deflazacort treatment was associated with a lesser increase in body weight than prednisone treatment at 12 months (2 versus 5 kg), though there was no significant difference in weight gain with longer-term treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-glucocorticoid-and-disease-modifying-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Thus, deflazacort is used in preference to prednisone in some centers (eg, in Canada) for patients with DMD who may be predisposed to obesity based on body habitus or family history.</p><p>Weight gain in patients with DMD is not solely an undesirable side effect because it is associated with an increase in muscle mass as noted above. In addition, one study found that ambulatory patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> did not have significantly greater weight gain than placebo treated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-glucocorticoid-and-disease-modifying-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].
