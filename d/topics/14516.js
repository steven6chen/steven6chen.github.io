Protein S is a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein, but it is not a zymogen of a serine protease enzyme. It serves as a cofactor for activated protein C, which inactivates procoagulant factors Va and VIIIa, reducing thrombin generation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110320\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110320 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-s-deficiency/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Protein S also serves as a cofactor for activated protein C in enhancing fibrinolysis and can directly inhibit prothrombin activation via interactions with other coagulation factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-s-deficiency/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].</p><p>Protein S deficiency impairs this normal control mechanism, increasing the risk of thrombosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;, section on 'Activated protein C and protein S'</a>.)</p><p>Protein S is synthesized by hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and megakaryocytes. It undergoes vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylation, which is required for its activity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin K and the synthesis and function of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mature gamma-carboxylated protein S circulates in two states: free, and bound to the complement component C4b-binding protein (C4b-BP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-s-deficiency/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The free form comprises 30 to 40 percent of total protein S and is the only form of protein S that has cofactor activity for activated protein C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-s-deficiency/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Total protein S levels change with age, but free protein S levels are more constant:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total protein S levels in healthy newborns at term are 15 to 30 percent of that in adults, while C4b-binding protein is markedly reduced to less than 20 percent. Thus, free protein S predominates and functional protein S levels are only slightly reduced compared with those in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-s-deficiency/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The average plasma concentration of total protein S in adults is 23 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL,</span> which by definition is assigned a value of 100 percent, or 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/mL</span> (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-s-deficiency/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The increase with age is seen with total protein S but not free protein S; a finding that has been explained by an increase in C4b-BP levels during normal aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-s-deficiency/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>Free and total protein S levels appear to be higher in men than in women, although no clinical significance has been ascribed to this minor difference.

In one series of 150 adults in a community practice, total protein S levels were increased as much as 10 percent between those with the lowest versus the highest cholesterol levels, and free protein S rose as much as 30 percent between those with the lowest versus the highest triglyceride levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-s-deficiency/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics of protein S deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Protein S deficiency is an autosomal dominant condition due to mutations in the <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/176880&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWFIMH7yNC/5dUJ3wt7p6kOQaWKKvl+hRpQmKFCzKfzM1&amp;TOPIC_ID=1357\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">PROS1</a> gene, a large gene on chromosome 3. The first descriptions of familial protein S deficiency were reported in 1984 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-s-deficiency/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Subsequently, a number of additional families and familial mutations have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-s-deficiency/abstract/18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-23</a>].</p><p>The majority of individuals with hereditary protein S deficiency are heterozygous for a <em>PROS1</em> mutation, although rare homozygous or compound heterozygous individuals with much more severe clinical features have been reported (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below).

In a series of 118 French patients with thromboembolism associated with protein S deficiency, 26 had a serine to proline substitution at amino acid 460 (the Heerlen polymorphism), which affects protein S metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-s-deficiency/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

As noted below (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Venous thromboembolism'</a> below), the individuals in this series included 2331 adults with a personal history of venous thromboembolism (VTE; but not a strong family history) and 2872 controls. When protein S deficiency was defined by the level of free protein S that correlated with an increased likelihood of VTE (&lt;33 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/dL),</span> the frequency of protein S deficiency in this population was quite low (approximately 48 of 5317; 0.9 percent). Only 10 of these individuals had a <em>PROS1 </em>mutation. Earlier studies had reported frequencies of protein S deficiency in the range of 2 to 8 percent among individuals with VTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-s-deficiency/abstract/18,20,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20,54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Venous thromboembolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Venous thromboembolism (VTE; including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) is the major clinical manifestation of protein S deficiency.</p><p>The absolute risk of VTE, typical age of presentation, and recurrence risk varies depending on the study population, with greater risks and younger age of presentation typically seen in thrombophilic families and individuals with combined inherited or inherited plus acquired VTE risk factors. Hereditary protein S deficiency is a rare risk factor for VTE in the absence of a family history. Available studies involving thrombophilic families and the general population include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 30 children with protein S deficiency who presented with VTE, the median age of the first thromboembolic event was 14.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-s-deficiency/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. There was an additional thrombophilic risk factor in 18 (60 percent) of the children, such as oral contraceptive use, chemotherapy, or prolonged immobilization. The remaining 12 events (40 percent) were unprovoked. Sites of thrombosis were deep veins of the leg (DVT; 12 events; 40 percent), cerebral veins (8 events; 27 percent), DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE; 5 events; 17 percent), calf vein (3 events; 10 percent), intracardiac veins (1 event), and purpura fulminans (1 event). There was a positive family history of thrombophilia in 17 (57 percent). As noted above, these 30 children represented 8 percent of children referred to the center for VTE. (See <a href=\"#H10172658\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series involving 12 thrombophilic families, 71 of 136 individuals tested (52 percent) had protein S deficiency, consistent with autosomal dominant transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-s-deficiency/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Of these, 39 (55 percent) had VTE. Most were DVT or PE, although there were five in unusual sites (eg, mesenteric or cerebral veins). The mean age of first thrombotic event was 28 years (range, 15 to 68 years). Approximately half the events were spontaneous and half were considered to be provoked.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2013 meta-analysis of studies involving patients with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) or hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome [BCS]), inherited protein S deficiency was found in 3 percent of each group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-s-deficiency/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a general population of individuals with a first VTE but without a strong family history of thrombophilia, the risk of VTE attributed to protein S deficiency appears to be lower than that in thrombophilic families. The Multiple Environmental and Genetic Assessment of risk factors for venous thrombosis (MEGA) case control study compared protein S levels in 4956 individuals with a first episode of VTE and 6297 controls (partners of patients or individuals identified by random digit telephone calls) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-s-deficiency/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Protein S levels below the 2.5<sup>th</sup> percentile (&lt;53 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/dL</span> for free protein S; &lt;68 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/dL</span> for total protein S), did not correlate with an increased risk of VTE (eg, odds ratio [OR] for free protein S 0.82; 95% CI 0.56-0.21). Only when the cutoff was set at a free protein S level below the 0.10<sup>th</sup> percentile (ie, levels in the bottom one-tenth of one percent; &lt;33 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/dL)</span> did the odds of VTE increase, although this did not reach statistical significance (OR 5.44; 95% CI 0.6-48.8). Total protein S levels did not correlate with thrombosis, even below the 0.10<sup>th</sup> percentile. As noted above, the clinical implications of MEGA are that hereditary protein S deficiency is a rare risk factor for VTE if testing is carried out in the absence of a family history.</p><p/><p>Some individuals with protein S deficiency and VTE also have a second thrombophilic defect. This was illustrated in a series of families with protein S deficiency, in which slightly over a third of families also had the factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-s-deficiency/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The risk of VTE was greater in those with both defects (13 of 18 [72 percent]; versus 4 of 21 with protein S deficiency alone and 4 of 21 with FVL mutation alone). Similar findings of increased VTE risk in individuals with combined protein S deficiency and FVL mutation have been reported by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-s-deficiency/abstract/36,57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,57,58</a>].</p><p>In addition to DVT and PE, thrombosis has also been reported in the axillary, mesenteric, and cerebral veins in patients with protein S deficiency.</p><p>Complications typically associated with protein C deficiency such as purpura fulminans and warfarin-induced skin necrosis have also been described with protein S deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-s-deficiency/abstract/54,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,59</a>].

Protein S deficiency is an autosomal dominant condition; most individuals are heterozygous for a <em>PROS1</em> mutation.
