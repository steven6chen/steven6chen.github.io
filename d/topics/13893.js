There are two types of PEEP:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extrinsic PEEP &ndash; PEEP that is provided by a mechanical ventilator is referred to as applied PEEP </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrinsic PEEP &ndash; PEEP that is secondary to incomplete expiration is referred to as intrinsic PEEP or auto-PEEP </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">APPLIED (EXTRINSIC) PEEP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Applied PEEP is usually one of the first ventilator settings chosen when mechanical ventilation is initiated. It is set directly on the ventilator. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Initiation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11865118\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal level of applied PEEP in most mechanically ventilated patients is unknown. Typically, a small amount of PEEP is applied routinely in most patients undergoing mechanical ventilation (3 to 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O; also known as physiologic PEEP). In select populations (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome), it is increased to maintain adequate oxygenation (&gt;5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O; supraphysiologic PEEP). The potential benefits of applied PEEP are best studied in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1137343097\"><span class=\"h3\">Routine mechanical ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low levels of applied PEEP are indicated for most patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. PEEP mitigates end-expiratory alveolar collapse (a consequence of the endotracheal tube bypassing the glottic apparatus) and may reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia and lung injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A randomized trial of 131 nonhypoxemic (partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio [PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub>]</span> &gt;250) patients undergoing mechanical ventilation received either applied PEEP at 5 to 8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (85 percent received 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) or no applied PEEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Applied PEEP was associated with a lower incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (9 versus 25 percent) and a lower likelihood of developing hypoxemia (19 versus 54 percent). There were no differences in mortality, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, or length of hospital stay. Applied PEEP is associated with decreased leakage of posterior pharyngeal secretions into the lower airway, providing a potential mechanism for this benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1137343109\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute respiratory distress syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Applied PEEP, usually at levels &ge;5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, are indicated in most patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other types of hypoxemic respiratory failure. The major benefit for applied PEEP in this population is improvement in oxygenation. The benefits, harms, and application of applied PEEP in this clinical setting are discussed separately.

The application of extrinsic PEEP in patients with auto-PEEP should always be less than the measured auto-PEEP (50 percent or no greater than 80 percent). The use of applied PEEP in this setting is discussed in greater detail, separately. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-complicating-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease#H588202\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive mechanical ventilation in acute respiratory failure complicating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;, section on 'Dynamic hyperinflation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults-with-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma#H1593700481\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive mechanical ventilation in adults with acute exacerbations of asthma&quot;, section on 'Adding extrinsic PEEP to offset intrinsic PEEP'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1137343312\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiogenic pulmonary edema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Applied PEEP has been used in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema to improve cardiac function. However, the data indicate that PEEP provides little additional benefit beyond the positive pressure ventilation alone. This was illustrated by a trial of 12 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, during which left ventricular performance was assessed by echocardiography before and after applied PEEP was increased by 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Left ventricular performance did not change when applied PEEP was increased. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1137343318\"><span class=\"h3\">Intraoperative patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal strategy for mechanically ventilating patients intraoperatively is unknown. Randomized studies have shown mixed results with a number of strategies that have employed PEEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. While some studies suggest a reduction in adverse pulmonary events, others show no benefit or potential harm using applied PEEP in this population. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One randomized study (IMPROVE) of 400 patients at moderate risk for pulmonary complications who underwent major abdominal surgery, compared a nonprotective strategy (high tidal volume; 10 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> that did not use PEEP to a lung protective strategy (low tidal volume; 6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> that used applied PEEP (6 to 8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. At seven days, the use of PEEP was associated with a reduction in adverse pulmonary events (28 versus 11 percent), need for mechanical ventilation (17 versus 5 percent), and shorter hospital length of stay (mean difference 2.5 days) but was not associated with a mortality benefit. However, the benefits reported in this study were more likely to be due to the differences in the tidal volume rather than the different PEEP strategies that were used. This study is discussed in detail, separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Tidal volume'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another multicenter trial (PROVHILO) in a similar population of surgical patients randomly assigned 900 patients to either receive high PEEP (12 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) or low PEEP (&le;2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) at a constant tidal volume of 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of ideal body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There were no differences at five days in postoperative pulmonary complications (39 versus 40 percent), length of hospital stay, or mortality. However, patients in the high PEEP group had a higher rate of hypotension (46 versus 36 percent) that required vasopressors and fluid resuscitation (62 versus 52 percent). A major flaw of this trial was the use of a fixed level of PEEP at 12 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, which is unusually high and potentially detrimental in patients who do not have ARDS; this could have mitigated any potential clinical benefit of PEEP. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Further studies are required to elucidate the optimal level of PEEP for patients undergoing surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1137343616\"><span class=\"h3\">Postoperative patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The application of PEEP has been employed in postoperative patients in an effort to prevent atelectasis and atelectrauma that can occur in injured lung when undergoing ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/5,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,10</a>].</p><p>The application of PEEP as an alveolar recruitment maneuver may be beneficial in the postoperative setting. One single center study of 320 patients who had undergone elective cardiac surgery and were mechanically ventilated for hypoxemia compared an intensive recruitment strategy with a moderate strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. An intensive strategy consisted of two rounds (four hours apart) of three cycles of 60 second lung inflation with PEEP 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, pressure controlled ventilation, driving pressure 15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, respiratory rate <span class=\"nowrap\">15/minute,</span> inspiratory time 1.5 seconds, and fraction of inspired oxygen 0.4 followed by low tidal volume ventilation and a PEEP setting of 8 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, while a moderate strategy consisted of two rounds (four hours apart) of three cycles of 30 second inflation with continuous positive pressure at 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, and fraction of inspired oxygen 0.6 followed low tidal volume ventilation and a PEEP setting of 8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. Intensive recruitment maneuvers resulted in fewer pulmonary complications (severity score 1.8 versus 2.1), and decreased ICU length of stay (3.8 versus 4.8 days) and mortality (2.5 versus 4.9 percent), without increasing the incidence of barotrauma. Flaws in the study design including small sample size, and lack of adjustment for confounding variables and control group, as well as poor generalizability limit interpretation such that further trials demonstrating similar benefit are needed before aggressive recruitment maneuvers can be routinely recommended in the postoperative setting.</p><p>Additional details regarding recruitment in patient with ARDS are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation of adults in acute respiratory distress syndrome&quot;, section on 'Recruitment maneuvers'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1137343628\"><span class=\"h3\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Applied PEEP has also been used in patients with flail chest (to stabilize the chest wall) or tracheobronchomalacia (to maintain patency of the airways during expiration) with mixed results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no absolute contraindications to applied PEEP. However, applied PEEP can have adverse consequences (especially at high levels) and should be used cautiously in patients who have intracranial abnormalities, unilateral or focal lung disease, hypotension, hypovolemia, pulmonary embolism, dynamic hyperinflation without airflow limitation, or a bronchopleural fistula. It may also have undesirable consequences in patients undergoing prone ventilation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Intracranial disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased intrathoracic pressure due to applied PEEP could theoretically decrease cerebral venous outflow, leading to increased intracranial pressure, decreased mean arterial pressure, or both. The end result may be decreased cerebral perfusion pressure and neurologic deterioration.</p><p>Whether this actually occurs is uncertain. Observational studies with patients who had acute stroke or acute subarachnoid hemorrhage found that incremental elevation of applied PEEP was associated with diminished cerebral perfusion pressure (due to decreased mean arterial pressure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In contrast, another observational study with patients who had traumatic brain injury found that applied PEEP was associated with increased cerebral perfusion pressure (due to decreased intracranial pressure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The reason for the conflicting results is uncertain, but may be related to varying effects of the different intracranial abnormalities.</p><p>Given the uncertainty that exists, it is prudent to monitor both the mean arterial blood pressure and intracranial pressure (if available) whenever applied PEEP is used in a patient with an intracranial abnormality. Reduction of applied PEEP should be considered if the mean arterial blood pressure decreases or intracranial pressure increases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of elevated intracranial pressure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Focal lung disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Applied PEEP can worsen hypoxemia in patients with focal lung disease (eg, pneumonia). This probably occurs because the applied PEEP compresses intraalveolar capillaries in the uninvolved lung, diverting blood flow to the injured lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This increases intrapulmonary shunting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypotension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Positive pressure ventilation increases intrathoracic pressure, which can decrease venous return, reduce cardiac output, and potentially cause hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This is exacerbated by applied PEEP, especially in hypovolemic patients. In euvolemic patients, applied PEEP up to 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O is generally well tolerated from a hemodynamic standpoint, as demonstrated by a trial of eight patients with ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Incremental increases of applied PEEP from 10 to 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O caused hypotension in only one patient, while gastric mucosal perfusion (a marker of systemic hypoperfusion) and cardiac index were unchanged in the remaining patients. A technique is being developed that estimates the cardiac output from changes in the pulmonary shunt at different levels of PEEP; the technique is not yet available for routine clinical use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

In contrast, in patients who are mechanically ventilated in the prone ventilation, 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O of applied PEEP is associated with a redistribution of blood flow to the dependent (ie, ventral) portion of the lung that is out of proportion to the redistribution of ventilation, thereby exacerbating the <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> mismatch. This suggests that supraphysiologic applied PEEP may be less beneficial, or potentially harmful, in patients undergoing prone ventilation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">AUTO (INTRINSIC) PEEP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incomplete expiration prior to the initiation of the next breath causes progressive air trapping (ie, dynamic hyperinflation). This accumulation of air increases alveolar pressure at the end of expiration, which is referred to as auto-PEEP.</p><p>This section focuses on auto-PEEP that develops during mechanical ventilation. Auto-PEEP that develops during spontaneous breathing is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dynamic hyperinflation in patients with COPD&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three common situations during which auto-PEEP develops: high minute ventilation, expiratory flow limitation, and expiratory resistance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">High minute ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A high minute ventilation is caused by large tidal volumes, a high respiratory rate, or both. Either alteration can create auto-PEEP.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large tidal volumes increase the volume that must be exhaled prior to the next breath. The larger the tidal volume, the less likely that the full tidal volume will be exhaled before the onset of the next breath.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High respiratory rates decrease the duration of expiration. The faster the respiratory rate, the shorter the expiratory time and the less likely that the full tidal volume will be exhaled before the onset of the next breath.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Expiratory flow limitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An expiratory flow limitation exists when expiratory flow is slowed by airway narrowing due to collapse, bronchospasm, inflammation, or remodeling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77948\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77948 \">figure 1</a>). It increases the likelihood that the full tidal volume will not be exhaled before the onset of the next breath and auto-PEEP will develop.</p><p>Most patients with chronic obstructive lung disease have an expiratory flow limitation, especially those with chronic obstructive airways disease (COPD). As a result, such patients are prone to developing auto-PEEP when mechanical ventilation is initiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>A patient's expiratory flow limitation is not routinely assessed in critical care units because it requires neuromuscular paralysis, specialized techniques, or both to be measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. However, it appears that expiratory flow limitation is more prominent when patients are supine rather than semirecumbent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Expiratory resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Expiratory resistance is conceptually similar to expiratory flow limitation in that it slows expiration and increases the likelihood that the full tidal volume will not be exhaled before the onset of the next breath. However, expiratory resistance is unrelated to the airways. Examples of expiratory resistance include a narrow diameter or kinked endotracheal tube, inspissated secretions, exhalation or PEEP valves, and patient-ventilator asynchrony. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Asynchrony'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential sequelae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Auto-PEEP increases intrathoracic pressure, which can decrease venous return, reduce cardiac output, and potentially cause hypotension. This is most pronounced in hypovolemic patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-and-pathophysiologic-consequences-of-mechanical-ventilation#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic and pathophysiologic consequences of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Hemodynamics'</a>.)</p><p>Auto-PEEP can also cause alveolar overdistension, increasing the likelihood of pulmonary barotrauma and ventilator-associated lung injury. Alveolar overdistension can also cause hypoxemia if <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> mismatch increases due to compression of adjacent pulmonary blood vessels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis, management, and prevention of pulmonary barotrauma during invasive mechanical ventilation in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventilator-induced-lung-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventilator-induced lung injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Finally, auto-PEEP increases the work required for a patient to trigger a ventilator breath when pressure-triggering is being used. This is because the patient must generate enough negative pressure to overcome the trigger sensitivity plus the auto-PEEP, rather than the trigger sensitivity alone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64640\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64640 \">figure 2</a>). As an example, a patient whose auto-PEEP is 8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and whose ventilator has a trigger sensitivity of -2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O needs to generate -10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O of negative pressure to trigger a breath. In contrast, a patient who has no auto-PEEP only needs to generate the -2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O of negative pressure that is necessary to overcome the trigger sensitivity. Inability to trigger breaths may cause patient-ventilator asynchrony, dyspnea, and insufficient ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

With flow versus time graphs, the upstroke that indicates inspiratory flow will begin before the expiration tracing reaches zero flow if auto-PEEP exists. With palpation and auscultation, inspiratory airflow will be heard before the expiratory airflow ceases. Palpation and auscultation can confirm that auto-PEEP is present, but it is unreliable for determining its absence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Another approach exists that can quantitate the auto-PEEP.

As a result, marked dynamic hyperinflation and auto-PEEP may be unrecognized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expiratory muscle activity in non-paralyzed patients can falsely elevate the end-expiratory alveolar pressure measurement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79638\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79638 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This can lead to the inappropriate and potentially harmful treatment of presumed auto-PEEP. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The second situation described above can be avoided by carefully palpating for the absence of expiratory muscle activity prior to measuring the end-expiratory alveolar pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This coincides with the onset of inspiration because the expiratory muscle must relax in order for the inspiratory muscles to decrease intrathoracic pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Steps should be taken to correct auto-PEEP as soon as it is identified. Initial efforts should focus on determining and treating the underlying cause. When auto-PEEP persists despite management of its underlying cause, applied PEEP may be helpful if the patient has an expiratory flow limitation.</p><p>When a high minute ventilation is the presumed cause of auto-PEEP, the minute ventilation should be decreased by lowering the tidal volume or respiratory rate. This frequently requires a strategy of permissive hypercapnia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permissive-hypercapnia-during-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Permissive hypercapnia during mechanical ventilation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When an expiratory flow limitation due to obstructive airways disease is the presumed cause of auto-PEEP, the duration of expiration should be prolonged. This can be accomplished by increasing the inspiratory flow, decreasing the tidal volume, or decreasing the respiratory rate. </p><p>Treatment with bronchodilators, steroids, and antibiotics may also be beneficial. In a study of 25 patients with COPD and acute respiratory failure, expiratory flow limitation was present in 96 percent of the patients at the initiation of mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The prevalence of expiratory flow limitation decreased to 47 percent at the time of extubation and 40 percent at the time of ICU discharge, indicating that expiratory flow limitation may respond to therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When increased expiratory resistance is the presumed cause of auto-PEEP, the source of increased resistance should be identified and corrected. This may require sedation, pharmacologic paralysis, or replacement of the endotracheal tube or ventilator tubing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Applied PEEP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small amounts of applied PEEP can decrease auto-PEEP in patients who have an expiratory flow limitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. This can be conceptualized as the applied PEEP holding open the narrowed airways during expiration, improving expiratory airflow, and allowing more complete expiration prior to the onset of the next breath. Additional benefits of using applied PEEP to offset auto-PEEP include decreased oxygen consumption and improved gas exchange. The latter is due to opening the small airways in the dependent lung zones and distributing inspired gas more homogeneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>].</p><p>Applied PEEP should always be less than the measured auto-PEEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Otherwise, alveolar pressure may increase, placing the patient at increased risk for complications such as pulmonary barotrauma or hypotension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72568\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72568 \">figure 4</a>). One study even suggested that applied PEEP does not need to exceed the measured auto-PEEP for this to occur. Rather, it can occur if the applied PEEP is greater than 85 percent of the measured auto-PEEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Given the potential inaccuracy of auto-PEEP measurements, it is prudent to set applied PEEP to a level that is less than 50 percent of the measured auto-PEEP.</p><p>Applied PEEP should not be used to counter auto-PEEP in patients who do not have an expiratory flow limitation. Applied PEEP may increase alveolar pressure and increase the risk of both barotrauma and hemodynamic compromise in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is the alveolar pressure above atmospheric pressure that exists at the end of expiration. PEEP that is applied through a mechanical ventilator is referred to as applied PEEP (also called extrinsic PEEP), whereas PEEP that is secondary to incomplete exhalation is referred to as auto-PEEP (also called intrinsic PEEP). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Applied PEEP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal level of PEEP in most populations is unknown. In general:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small amount of applied PEEP (3 to 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) is used in most mechanically ventilated patients to mitigate end-expiratory alveolar collapse.

However, applied PEEP can have adverse consequences (especially at high levels) and should be used cautiously in patients with intracranial abnormalities, unilateral or focal lung disease, hypotension, hypovolemia, dynamic hyperinflation without airflow limitation, or a bronchopleural fistula.
