Events associated with prominent motor activity or altered consciousness are often presumed to be epileptic seizures. However, the event may actually represent one of a wide array of nonepileptic paroxysmal events, such as syncope, parasomnias, movement disorders, and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81289\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81289 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>PNES are characterized by sudden and time-limited disturbances of motor, sensory, autonomic, cognitive, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> emotional functions that can mimic epileptic seizures. However, in contrast to epileptic seizures, PNES are not associated with physiological central nervous system dysfunction but are instead psychogenically determined. Historical terms for PNES, including pseudoseizures and hysterical seizures, are now discouraged.</p><p>It is important that clinicians consider PNES when evaluating patients with episodic symptoms. Missing this diagnosis may result in inappropriate treatment with antiseizure drugs that are associated with potential morbidity, especially if drug toxicity is incurred in the attempt to suppress episodes. While video-electroencephalography (EEG) has greatly advanced our ability to recognize PNES, an accurate diagnosis is best achieved by assimilating a wide variety of clues, including a detailed history from the patient and observers, the physical examination, selected testing, and a psychiatric evaluation.</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of PNES are discussed here. Other nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in adolescents and adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incidence rates of PNES in the general population are not well established. One epidemiologic study in Iceland reported an incidence rate of 1.4 per 100,000 individuals over age 15 years; a study in Ohio documented a mean incidence of 3 per 100,000 between 1995 and 1998 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The prevalence of PNES has been estimated to be between 2 to 33 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Among patients referred to outpatient epilepsy centers, 5 to 25 percent of patients are felt to have PNES, while 25 to 40 percent of patients evaluated in inpatient epilepsy monitoring units for intractable seizures are diagnosed with PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>].</p><p>PNES most commonly presents in the third decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. However, most age groups can be affected, including young children and the elderly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. One study suggests that the age of onset may be influenced by pre-existing conditions; patients with learning disabilities had a relatively younger age of onset compared with those with a history of physical or psychosocial trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-seizures-and-epilepsy-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of seizures and epilepsy in older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>PNES has a female predominance ranging from 66 to 99 percent in different series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/2,7,8,10,13,16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,8,10,13,16-20</a>]. This is consistent with gender ratios described in conversion disorder, one of the salient psychiatric conditions underlying PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>] (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial history'</a> below). Race, marital status, and years of education do not appear to influence the prevalence of PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES OF EVENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recognizing PNES can be challenging even for experienced observers, in part because of the broad diversity of presentations. Nonetheless, clues that arouse suspicion for this diagnosis are often apparent from the clinical history (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77773\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77773 \">table 2</a>). One systematic review found that long duration, fluctuating course, asynchronous movements, pelvic thrusting, side-to-side head or body movements, ictal eye closing, ictal crying, memory recall, and absent postictal confusion were the most reliable signs in distinguishing PNES from epileptic seizure; occurrence out of true sleep favored epileptic seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. It is important to remember that no single feature is either sensitive or specific for PNES.</p><p>A history from patients with suspected PNES should elicit information relevant to any paroxysmal disorder including seizures:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detailed description of the event as perceived by the patient and as witnessed by others, including prodromal and postictal features</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Precipitants, circumstances in which episodes occur</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Episode frequency, duration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors that reduce seizure frequency or attenuate an episode</p><p/><p>However, it is important to note that patients as well as eyewitnesses can report clinical features that are discrepant from each other and from review of video recorded events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Precipitants and setting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The setting in which an episode occurs can be helpful in distinguishing PNES and epilepsy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most episodes of PNES occur in front of witnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/14,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,26,27</a>]. In one study, the occurrence of an episode in the doctor's waiting or examination room was estimated to have a 75 percent predictive value for PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Similarly, in a study of patients undergoing EEG monitoring, episodes that occurred at the time of electrode placement were found to be PNES, not epileptic seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PNES tend not to occur during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/23,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,28</a>]. In contrast, epileptic seizures can occur during sleep, and in some forms of epilepsy, nocturnal episodes are most frequent. However, nocturnal seizures are frequently unwitnessed, and patients with PNES may report (erroneously) that seizures occur during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. Patients with PNES may appear to be asleep just before seizure-onset, but the EEG in these cases demonstrates wakefulness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Video-EEG monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While it is intuitive that PNES would be more likely to be associated with stressful situations, stress is also commonly cited as a seizure precipitant in patients with epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In one series of patients with PNES, witness responders were more likely than patients to associate emotional stress as a trigger for events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased seizure frequency during the perimenstrual time period suggests epileptic seizures. In one series, perimenstrual exacerbation was associated with 13 of 27 patients with epileptic seizures versus 1 of 38 patients with PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PNES are often frequent. At the time of evaluation, most patients report at least daily episodes; whereas less than one event a week is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/2,6,8,10,20,27,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,8,10,20,27,35</a>]. This observation may reflect a sampling bias.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Ictal features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unresponsive behavior with motor manifestations mimicking a generalized convulsion or a complex partial seizure is the most common manifestation of a PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/7,8,13,18,27,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,13,18,27,35-37</a>]. Less common are events that mimic atonic, absence, or simple partial seizures. A variety of clinical behaviors may occur during PNES, some of which are useful in distinguishing them from epileptic seizures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77773\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77773 \">table 2</a>). However, no single semiologic feature is either sensitive or specific for PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, eyewitness reports by family members and caregivers can be unreliable in their description of these features, when compared with video review of events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of convulsive-like motor activity can occur in PNES. While motor manifestations of an epileptic seizure usually take the form of brief tonic posturing or a synchronized convulsion with a defined progression of motor activity; movements in PNES are more often asynchronous, variable, and wax and wane over the course of the ictus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/5,7,23,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,23,38</a>]. Specific movements such as writhing, thrashing, pelvic thrusts, opisthotonus (arched back), and jactitation (rolling from side to side) suggest PNES, but these are not always present, particularly in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/7,14,27,36,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14,27,36,38,39</a>]. Moreover, some epileptic seizures, such as those of frontal lobe origin, can produce unusual-appearing motor activities similar to those seen in PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/5,23,29,40-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,23,29,40-45</a>]. Stereotyped and consistent lateralization of motor features usually, but not always, suggests epilepsy; some patients have PNES with consistent semiology and little variation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/23,29,37,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,29,37,46</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Localization-related (focal) epilepsy: Causes and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Frontal lobe epilepsy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classic symptoms of epileptic seizures such as tongue biting, incontinence, and self-injury, are more common in epileptic seizures, but they can occur in a third or more of patients with PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/6-8,20,23,35,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8,20,23,35,47,48</a>]. A tongue bitten on the side is more specific for epileptic seizure, than when bitten on the tip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incomplete loss of consciousness during the episode, suggested either by responsiveness to stimuli or by later recall of events during the ictus, suggests PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/7,24,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,24,50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weeping, ictal stuttering, and vocalizations are relatively uncommon in epileptic seizures and suggest PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/14,23,51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,23,51-54</a>]. When vocalization occurs in an epileptic seizure, it usually occurs at seizure onset, not during the convulsion, and is characterized by a fragmented guttural utterance, caused by a tonic diaphragm forcing air against tonic or clonic vocal cords [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A seizure aura is frequently reported in PNES (25 to 60 percent) and may be a more common symptom than in epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/18,20,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20,27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autonomic manifestations during an ictus (eg, tachycardia, cyanosis) suggest epileptic seizure, and their absence, particularly during a major convulsion, suggests PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/38,54,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,54,56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eyes are usually open during the ictus of a generalized convulsive seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/23,24,39,49,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24,39,49,57</a>]. Forced eye closure in particular suggests PNES. Sensitivity and specificity of eye closure as a sign for PNES varies according to how it is defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. One study that calculated duration of time for eye closure (rather than absolute presence or absence) found only moderate sensitivity, but high specificity for PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Similarly, in another study, eye opening at seizure onset was found to have a high sensitivity and lower specificity for epileptic seizure as compared with PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In both of these series, observer reports of ictal eye closure were not reliable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ictal atonia is not a common PNES manifestation, however, when prolonged, this almost always represents PNES, not epileptic seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While the ictus of an epileptic seizure is typically very brief, often less than one minute, PNES are rarely less than one minute and are usually much longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/7-9,14,23,29,37,39,44,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9,14,23,29,37,39,44,59,60</a>]. Prolonged episodes (ie, psychogenic status epilepticus) are not rare. In one series, 78 percent of patients with PNES reported at least one event longer the 30 minutes, and half of these patients had recurrent episodes of psychogenic status epilepticus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p/><p>While stereotyped behaviors during events usually suggest seizures rather than PNES, one investigation that evaluated symptom clustering found that 61 percent of patients with PNES tended to have similar types of behavior during their attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Postictal symptoms</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid alerting and reorientation is common after PNES but uncommon with epileptic seizures, except for certain seizure types, such as absence or frontal lobe seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/23,24,27,29,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24,27,29,40</a>].

Patients with PNES who report a history of sexual abuse may be more likely to have events that are clinically more severe and more likely to resemble epileptic seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. In another series they were also more likely to exhibit self-harming behaviors and other medically unexplained symptoms in addition to PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Dysfunctional family relationships (poor communication or support, interpersonal conflict, trauma) are also reported by many PNES patients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/18,82-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,82-84</a>].</p><p>In contrast, depression with major psychosis and schizophrenia are relatively uncommon in patients with PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Some authors distinguish between comorbid and etiologic psychiatric conditions, but this implies a detailed understanding of the pathophysiology of these symptoms, which is lacking.

This contrasts with factitious disorder or malingering, in which symptoms are, at least to some extent, voluntary and consciously produced. Factitious disorders and malingering are rarely responsible for PNES. While the clinician should seek evidence for potential primary gain (affording relief from emotional conflict or tension) and secondary gain (deriving advantages such as attention, relief from responsibilities, or attaining disability benefits), it should never be assumed that patients with PNES are &quot;faking&quot; their symptoms.</p><p>Psychosocial stressors that may precipitate the emergence of PNES in vulnerable patients include bereavement; unwanted pregnancy; ongoing physical, verbal, or sexual abuse; lawsuits; job pressure; financial difficulties; impending divorce; domestic conflicts; and assault [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/6,18,20,71,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,18,20,71,86</a>].

Sometimes the recent event seems relatively minor, but may serve as the &quot;last straw&quot; in a series of events or may serve as a reminder of more significant remote events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Concurrent or past epilepsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimates of the prevalence of concurrent epilepsy among patients with PNES vary from 5 to 56 percent, in part because of differing diagnostic criteria used to determine the coexistence of epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/13,15,18,20,89-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,18,20,89-93</a>].</p><p>In one case series with video-EEG documentation of both PNES and epileptic seizures in the same patient, there was notably different clinical semiology for PNES compared with epileptic seizures in 18 of 20 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. However, another series found that patients with PNES and probable temporal lobe epilepsy had symptoms that appeared to be more characteristic of temporal lobe seizures, possibly because of learned behaviors from their own seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p>A few patients (2 to 9 percent) with epilepsy develop PNES after epilepsy surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/96-98\" class=\"abstract_t\">96-98</a>]. These typically emerge within the first several months, at a time when other psychiatric complications are also most incident. These patients often manifest other symptoms of psychiatric distress (eg, anxiety, psychosis). The symptoms may approximate presurgical epileptic events but are often very different. This phenomenon may be due in part to a paradoxical dependence on seizures and all of its psychosocial ramifications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Seizure model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with PNES have often witnessed epileptic events that may serve as a clinical model. A seizure history in a friend or relative, or an occupation as a healthcare worker is not uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In one study, patients with PNES were significantly more likely to have witnessed an epileptic seizure prior to their event than were patients with epilepsy (66 versus 11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].

It is not clear why such an association should exist. The head injury may be associated with psychological as well as physical trauma, which may serve as a precipitant for PNES. In some series, a patient's disability status or litigation for damages appeared to provide a source of secondary gain for PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Recall bias may also contribute to this apparent association.</p><p>PNES is also well-described in patients with neurologic developmental disabilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/13,103,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,103,104</a>]. In this population, distinguishing these events from epileptic seizures and other repetitive, stereotyped behaviors is a particular challenge. In one study, individuals with PNES and learning disabilities were more likely to have circumstantial triggering of events and more prolonged events than individuals without learning disabilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>A history of recurrent medical evaluations for other unexplained somatic complaints should be examined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

In one series, 30 percent of PNES patients had a sufficient burden of gastrointestinal complaints, pain, fatigue, and other complaints to meet criteria for an undifferentiated somatoform disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. In another study that included over 250 patients with either PNES or epilepsy who underwent video-EEG monitoring over a two-year period, patients with PNES were significantly more likely than those with epilepsy (66 versus 27 percent) to have one or more of the following diagnoses: fibromyalgia, systemic exertion intolerance disease (also known as chronic fatigue syndrome), chronic pain syndrome, headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical examination of patients with PNES may be completely normal, demonstrate neurologic abnormalities associated with unrelated neurologic disorders, or exhibit classic signs of conversion disorder.

However, some believe this finding is overemphasized in PNES patients and may be absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary consideration in the differential diagnosis of PNES are epileptic seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Seizures arising from the frontal lobe in particular are often mistaken for PNES because of their unusual semiology.

While not without limitations, video-electroencephalography (EEG) is the gold standard test for the diagnosis of PNES and should be performed in all patients in whom this diagnosis is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/9,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,108</a>]. Without video-EEG, the level of diagnostic certainty varies according to the combination of patient history, witness observations, and ictal and interictal EEG data available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>].</p><p>Patients with PNES are also likely to undergo other diagnostic testing during the course of their evaluation. Some tests can provide support for the diagnosis, others may provide misleading information. Other tests, while not helpful in diagnosis of PNES, are potentially useful in evaluating comorbidities and choosing subsequent treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2201896070\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important that clinicians consider PNES when evaluating patients with episodic symptoms. Missing this diagnosis may result in inappropriate treatment with antiseizure drugs that are associated with potential morbidity, especially if drug toxicity is incurred in the attempt to suppress episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/2,64,110\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,64,110</a>]. Prolonged episodes, &quot;psychogenic status epilepticus&quot; in particular, are often treated with toxic antiseizure drug doses, intubation, and iatrogenically induced coma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/61,64-66,110-114\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,64-66,110-114</a>]. When PNES occur during pregnancy, these treatments pose additional risks to the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Recurrent visits to the emergency room and hospitalizations for uncontrolled, unrecognized PNES place a cost burden on the health care system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. Finally, failure to recognize psychiatric issues may promote the persistence of conversion symptoms and deny the patient needed psychiatric interventions.</p><p>The diagnosis of PNES can be challenging. In some case series, delay to PNES diagnosis has been as long as 9 to 16 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/6,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,47</a>]. This is due in part to the broad diversity of PNES presentations and the lack of one single unifying presenting symptom. Other sources of misdiagnosis include an inadequate history, co-occurrence of PNES and epilepsy in the same patient, poor physician-patient rapport, reliance upon clinical observation of the event, discomfort in making a psychiatric diagnosis, and reluctance to obtain a psychiatric evaluation before the clinician feels confident about the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. While video-EEG has greatly advanced our ability to recognize PNES, an accurate diagnosis is best achieved by assimilating a wide variety of clues, including a detailed history from the patient and observers, the physical examination, selected testing, and a psychiatric evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Associated features and conditions'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Electroencephalography</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Routine EEG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine EEG is often inadequate for distinguishing epileptic seizures from PNES. One reason is that a routine EEG records activity for only 20 to 30 minutes and is therefore unlikely to capture an ictus. A normal interictal EEG does not exclude the possibility of epilepsy or confirm the diagnosis of PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. At the same time, interictal epileptiform abnormalities do not rule out PNES. While more prevalent among patients with epilepsy, these are also seen in patients with PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/47,94,118\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,94,118</a>]. In patients felt to have PNES alone (no comorbid epilepsy), the prevalence of interictal EEG abnormalities ranges from 10 to 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/8,47,92,93,101,118\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,47,92,93,101,118</a>]. An abnormal interictal EEG is more common if there is a past or concurrent history of epilepsy or other underlying neurologic injury or disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Video-EEG monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Video-EEG monitoring combines extended EEG monitoring with time-locked video acquisition that allows for analysis of clinical and electrographic features during a captured event. The yield of monitoring is high; 73 to 96 percent of patients will have typical PNES within first 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/9,28,119,120\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,28,119,120</a>].</p><p>Caution is required for interpretation. While the majority of generalized tonic-clonic seizures reveal an ictal EEG correlate, the tracing may be obscured by muscle artifact. On the other hand, only 15 to 33 percent of simple partial seizures or seizure auras, which involve a limited brain area and are of deep origin, are associated with surface EEG abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. Furthermore, in some seizures, the early onset of motor activity results in artifacts that can obscure EEG changes. As a result, failure to see an electrographic seizure does not exclude epilepsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Video and ambulatory EEG monitoring in the diagnosis of seizures and epilepsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Accurate interpretation of video-EEG monitoring requires careful analysis of the clinical events with any changes in the EEG occurring before, during, and after the seizure. As one example, a finding of &quot;preictal pseudosleep,&quot; the appearance of clinical sleep while the EEG tracing demonstrates wakefulness is a very specific, although insensitive, indicator of PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Patients with diverse episode types may have both epileptic seizures and PNES. It is important to determine from both patients and family members that the event captured on video-EEG is typical of the events that are being evaluated. It can be helpful to show the video of the event to family members who can indicate how closely it resembles prior events they have witnessed.</p><p>One study of interrater reliability of video-EEG found only moderate agreement (kappa = 0.57) for the diagnosis of PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. Limitations of this study that differ from &quot;real-life&quot; use of this test include a forced choice paradigm (epileptic versus psychogenic nonepileptic versus physiologic nonepileptic seizures) that was based on the analysis of a single episode with no access to other clinical data.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Spell induction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Video-EEG monitoring may be supplemented with the administration of a placebo designed to induce a PNES. This may be helpful if the patient fails to have a spontaneous event during prolonged video-EEG monitoring.</p><p>This maneuver is typically performed by administering intravenous saline or rubbing alcohol on the skin of the patient and telling the patient that this may induce an episode. Between 67 to 90 percent of patients with PNES will have a typical event in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/2,27,86,123-126\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,27,86,123-126</a>]. While much less common, epileptic events have also been reported to occur with induction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/90,92,119,127-129\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,92,119,127-129</a>]. Because of this, induction should be performed during video-EEG. It is also essential to confirm that the elicited episode is representative of the spells under investigation. A patient with epilepsy may have a PNES under these circumstances, but the features are usually atypical of their usual events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>].</p><p>Use of this technique is controversial. While facilitating diagnosis, the inherent deceit in this approach may jeopardize the physician-patient relationship and impede future treatment efforts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. However, some experts believe that these considerations are outweighed by the benefits of making an accurate diagnosis and avoiding future morbidity associated with inappropriate treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/2,132,133\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,132,133</a>]. Alternative techniques that employ photic stimulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hyperventilation with suggestion may obviate the deceitful aspects, as these are routinely used to precipitate epileptic seizures. This approach may be more acceptable to patients and physicians, although special care is required as an epileptic seizure is more likely to be precipitated with these techniques, than with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/27,123\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,123</a>]. As an alternative, some physicians report that they successfully use placebo induction techniques after informing the patient that they are being used to elicit a possible psychogenic as well as epileptic seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>].

In such cases, outpatient ambulatory EEG, ideally with concomitant video may be helpful. Advising family members to have a video camera ready to record on stand-by can be helpful as well. While the absence of concomitant EEG is a significant limitation, direct observation of the clinical event can provide the physician with valuable information that aids in the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Pooled sensitivity from several studies report prolactin level elevations (twice the baseline level) in 60 percent of generalized tonic clonic seizures and 46 percent of complex partial seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>]. The sensitivity is lower for simple partial seizures. Prolactin levels are less likely to rise after seizures that do not involve mesial temporal areas, making this a less sensitive test for epileptic seizures arising from the frontal lobe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The timing of measuring prolactin is crucial.

A baseline prolactin level should be determined from a blood sample drawn six hours after the event. Prolactin elevations have not been well characterized in the setting of repeated seizures or status epilepticus, and have unclear utility in this setting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Prolactin levels are unlikely to rise after a PNES, but elevations can occur after syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/135,137\" class=\"abstract_t\">135,137</a>]. Dopamine antagonists (eg, neuroleptic agents) can elevate prolactin levels and confound the results. Thus, an elevated prolactin level can be helpful in identifying a physiologic episode (epileptic seizure or syncope); however, a nonelevated prolactin level does not imply PNES.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other serum markers have been used to help distinguish PNES from epileptic seizures and other physiologic events. These include: creatine phosphokinase (CPK), cortisol, white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, pCO2, ammonia, and neuron specific enolase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/138-141\" class=\"abstract_t\">138-141</a>]. CPK levels in particular are often elevated after generalized tonic-clonic seizures, but not after partial seizures. The later rise and prolonged elevation, up to 24 hours postictally, makes this test somewhat more useful in the outpatient setting. However, a defined threshold level for abnormality, sensitivity, and specificity remain to be determined for CPK, as for other serum markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/142,143\" class=\"abstract_t\">142,143</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a structural abnormality is seen on brain MRI, it suggests a neuroanatomic substrate for epilepsy, and provides support for a diagnosis of epilepsy. However, many series report abnormal brain MRI in 10 to 38 percent of patients with PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/8,18,47,101,144\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,18,47,101,144</a>]. At the same time, many patients with epileptic seizures have normal brain MRI. Abnormalities identified in PNES patients include arachnoid cyst, post-traumatic or gliotic change, hippocampal sclerosis, and venous angioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].</p><p>Abnormalities on interictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are also reported in PNES as well as epilepsy cases. However, a change in focal perfusion from in an ictal or postictal SPECT compared with an interictal SPECT can help distinguish epileptic seizures from PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/144-148\" class=\"abstract_t\">144-148</a>]. This technique may be particularly useful when movement-related muscle artifact obscures EEG interpretation.

The common occurrence of cognitive deficits, particularly in attention and memory, in both PNES and epilepsy patients limits the utility of neuropsychological testing for distinguishing between them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/13,70,101,149-151\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,70,101,149-151</a>]. Some of these deficits may be related to antiseizure drugs and other medications. Neuropsychological testing may be suspicious for PNES when a pattern of failure to recognize words presented repeatedly is exhibited in the face of only rarely making false positive errors (termed a &quot;negative response bias&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/152,153\" class=\"abstract_t\">152,153</a>].</p><p>Personality profile testing such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), a common component of neuropsychological testing, can be helpful in supplementing formal psychiatric evaluations and highlighting comorbid psychiatric disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/154\" class=\"abstract_t\">154</a>]. Patients with PNES typically have high scores on somatization, hypochondriasis, and hysteria subscales [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/9,18,118,154-156\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,18,118,154-156</a>].

This questionnaire was based primarily on items that were culled from other psychosocial scales that question patients about attitudes toward health and lifestyle, self-efficacy, and symptoms of anxiety and depression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychiatric evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While essential in the evaluation of patients with suspected PNES, the role of psychiatric evaluation is not to establish or refute a PNES diagnosis, but rather to identify comorbid or underlying psychiatric conditions that will hopefully direct treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/8,59,77,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,59,77,108</a>].</p><p>An experienced clinician in a detailed psychiatric interview will elicit clinical features that may establish a diagnosis of depression, anxiety, somatoform, dissociative, and other disorders. Sufficient rapport may also be established in this setting, which allows for a previously unreported history of sexual abuse or other trauma to be revealed. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial history'</a> above.)</p><p>Findings on neuropsychological testing may supplement the interview in arriving at one or more psychiatric disorders. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Neuropsychological testing'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESENTING THE DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Presenting the diagnosis of PNES to patients is a challenge. Most agree that this should not take place until the clinician feels very definite about the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/158,159\" class=\"abstract_t\">158,159</a>]. Care providers who take on this role should be well-trained in delivering this information. Clinicians may prefer to reveal the diagnosis in a separate outpatient meeting rather than in the video-EEG monitoring unit.</p><p>This conversation is crucially important for the patient's prognosis. Because most serious morbidity associated with PNES is from inappropriate aggressive treatment of presumed epileptic seizures, it is important for the patient and family to accept the diagnosis of PNES in order to avoid emergency room visits, as well as to obtain appropriate psychiatric treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/115,159\" class=\"abstract_t\">115,159</a>].</p><p>A useful method for communicating the diagnosis of PNES to patients emphasizes the presentation in a nonjudgmental fashion that strives to maintain patient dignity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/108,160\" class=\"abstract_t\">108,160</a>]. Techniques and talking points that we and others have found useful in this conversation include some of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/74,160\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,160</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We state that we do not consider the episodes to be caused by epileptic discharges, but rather represent &quot;the mind playing tricks on the body.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We emphasize that this problem is as serious as one caused by epilepsy and deserves the attention and treatment that is accorded any illness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We discuss how stress afflicts each of us to variable degrees and in different ways. We note that &quot;the body needs to blow off steam&quot; in some fashion; some people release this stress with the development of headaches, others with tremors, and some with nonepileptic seizures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We emphasize that the episodes are experienced as real and disabling, and that although they relate to emotional or psychological causes, we do not dismiss the problem, and we do not consider the patient to be &quot;crazy.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We state that their disorder warrants different treatments than those administered for epilepsy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We tell our patients that we expect that they may react in many ways to this diagnosis. Many patients become angry in response to receiving the diagnosis. Some may acknowledge these feelings, while others may not. An angry reaction may forebode a poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/6,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,102</a>]. In my experience, it is useful to anticipate these feelings at the time of revealing the diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We and others have also found that patients may exhibit exacerbations of their episodes after the diagnosis is revealed and we often warn the patients not to be surprised if this were to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>One study used a semi-structured interview and a printed leaflet that emphasized many of these points, among others, in communicating a new diagnosis of PNES to 50 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/161\" class=\"abstract_t\">161</a>]. The investigators felt that these patients responded more positively and had better outcomes than those in whom this approach was not utilized, but there was no control group in this study for direct comparison.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROLOGIC FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A frequent error on the part of neurologists is the immediate discharge of patients with PNES, with the rationale that the diagnosis is psychiatric and not neurologic. In fact, some experts advise instead that PNES patients should not be discharged from the neurologist's care until patients and families accept the fact that they do not have epilepsy, have transitioned to psychiatric care, and have agreed on the time to discontinue neurologic care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/159,162\" class=\"abstract_t\">159,162</a>].</p><p>Premature discharge can exacerbate episodes and increase resistance to accepting the diagnosis. Patients often report a poor understanding of the diagnosis and may complain in a follow-up that they did not receive a clarification of diagnosis even if a thorough discussion was rendered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/6,163\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,163</a>].</p><p>Ideally, a close dialogue should also be developed and maintained between neurologic, psychiatric, and primary care providers, who often disagree about the diagnosis and the accuracy of video-EEG monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/6,75,108,159,164\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,75,108,159,164</a>]. This communication may limit mixed and conflicting messages from different doctors that can contribute to the overall poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Cautious discontinuation of antiseizure drug therapy should be coordinated where possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. It is not infrequent for episodes to increase during this time period. In some cases, epileptic seizures as well as PNES emerge during this interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/165\" class=\"abstract_t\">165</a>]. Repeat video-EEG monitoring may be needed if there is doubt that these episodes are different in nature than those documented to be PNES. Some antiseizure drugs have mood stabilizing properties and their discontinuation may exacerbate an underlying affective or panic disorder. One small randomized study suggested that early withdrawal of antiseizure drugs may be associated with some benefits, including decreased use of rescue antiseizure drug treatment and higher employment rates at 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/166\" class=\"abstract_t\">166</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While some patients relinquish episodes soon after the diagnosis is revealed, most will continue to have episodes and will require long-term psychiatric interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/7,13,73,158,167,168\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13,73,158,167,168</a>].</p><p>Treatment recommendations in PNES are mostly based upon clinical experience and observational studies; there have been few randomized treatment trials for PNES. One problem in designing treatments and trials to assess their efficacy relates to the heterogeneous combinations of psychiatric disorders that underlie PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>]. Additionally, patients with PNES often do not adhere to treatment recommendations or return for follow-up, and may be particularly disinclined to enroll in treatment trials.</p><p>Psychiatric interventions are the hallmark of treatment for PNES, although response is often incomplete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. These are individualized according to the underlying psychiatric diagnosis. </p><p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a brief psychosocial intervention that is comprised of a variety of therapeutic approaches. All of the approaches share the basic assumption that therapeutic change can be effected by targeting changes in thoughts (beliefs and attitudes) and behaviors that contribute to emotional distress. An approach based upon a fear avoidance model may be especially successful for patients who have PNES as a dissociative response in stressful circumstances. Observational case series and small randomized trials suggest that CBT may be helpful in reducing episodes and improving psychosocial functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/169-172\" class=\"abstract_t\">169-172</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized controlled trial compared CBT with standard medical care in 66 patients with PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/171\" class=\"abstract_t\">171</a>]. After four months of treatment, patients on active treatment had a lower median monthly frequency of seizures (2.0 versus 6.8). There was also a trend toward efficacy in more patients achieving a three month seizure remission (OR = 3; p = 0.08). There was no effect of treatment on psychosocial function, health service use, or employment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter pilot trial, 38 patients with PNES were randomly assigned to receive CBT-informed psychotherapy with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a>, sertraline alone, or usual treatment for 16 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/172\" class=\"abstract_t\">172</a>]. Seizure frequency was reduced by 51 percent in those who received CBT alone and 59 percent in those who received CBT plus sertraline; seizures were not significantly reduced in those treated with sertraline alone or usual care. CBT was also associated with significant improvements in depression, anxiety, quality of life, and global functioning. Notably, however, only a minority of patients became episode-free in either of the CBT arms, and the durability of response beyond four months is not known.</p><p/><p>Traditional psychotherapy has been used in patients with PNES with mixed success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/167,173,174\" class=\"abstract_t\">167,173,174</a>]. Group therapy sessions also employ traditional psychodynamic techniques, and small studies have reported decreased episode frequency and improvement in global measures of mental health and anxiety in some patients with PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/175-178\" class=\"abstract_t\">175-178</a>]. The high prevalence of family problems in patients with PNES offer promise that family-related education and interventions may be useful, but these have not been systematically studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>Psychodynamic interpersonal therapy is an alternative form of psychotherapy. In a case series of 47 patients with PNES, this intervention was associated with seizure remission in 25 percent, and a &gt;50 percent seizure reduction in 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/179\" class=\"abstract_t\">179</a>].</p><p>Antidepressants and anxiolytics may be prescribed on an individualized basis. These may better address psychiatric comorbidities of depression and anxiety rather than an underlying causative psychiatric disorder. These medications have had mixed results in open-label studies of PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/175,180,181\" class=\"abstract_t\">175,180,181</a>]. In a pilot study, 38 patients with PNES were randomly assigned to treatment with flexible-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/182\" class=\"abstract_t\">182</a>]. Active treatment was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in PNES frequency. Another pilot study found no benefit of sertraline except when combined with CBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/172\" class=\"abstract_t\">172</a>].</p><p>Barriers to effective treatment of PNES patients include poor compliance and financial and insurance-related limitations for ongoing treatment. Another challenge is the difficulty finding psychiatric providers who are well-acquainted and comfortable dealing with PNES.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Driving</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few data regarding driving safety in patients with PNES. While many physicians recommend driving restrictions to their patients with PNES, the little available evidence has not demonstrated that patients with PNES are at increased risk of motor vehicle accidents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/183-186\" class=\"abstract_t\">183-186</a>]. In the absence of data supporting that patients with PNES in general are at risk of MVA, we suggest that such decisions be individualized based on the nature of the episodes, the diagnostic certainty, any precipitating factors or situations, and the patient's overall neuropsychiatric condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most studies that have assessed the prognosis in patients after PNES diagnosis suggest that only a minority (25 to 38 percent) of patients achieve seizure freedom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/6,8,18,73,187,188\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,18,73,187,188</a>]. Children have a better prognosis than adults, with 70 to 80 percent achieving seizure remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/189\" class=\"abstract_t\">189</a>].</p><p>While outcome is often reported as a percent of those with seizure remission, this narrow measure does not necessarily reflect the overall clinical outcome with respect to psychiatric and psychosocial status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/8,169,187,190\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,169,187,190</a>]. As an example, in one study, 56 percent of patients overall continued to depend on state-supported financial benefits at four years after PNES diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/8,187\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,187</a>]. The percentage was lower, but still substantial, 43 percent, among those in episode remission. Other studies have also found that occupational status, while more likely to improve if PNES cease, often does not, even when episodes do remit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/35,191\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,191</a>]. Some studies suggest that psychosocial issues and depression, rather than persistent PNES, are more directly related to disability and reduced quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/169,192\" class=\"abstract_t\">169,192</a>].</p><p>Both attempted and successful suicides have been reported in some series with follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/35,169,193\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,169,193</a>]. In one of these cohorts, suicide attempts were equally frequent (11 of 56 patients overall) in those with or without seizure remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. There is limited evidence to suggest that there may be a modest increase in premature mortality in patients with PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/194\" class=\"abstract_t\">194</a>]. </p><p>Some patients may develop new somatic complaints after their PNES remit. A structured interview of 56 patients, six or more months following PNES diagnosis, revealed moderate to severe pain syndromes, especially headaches, in 77 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Twenty-six of 27 patients who stopped experiencing PNES still experienced moderate pain. While the etiologies or other details about these pain symptoms were not studied, it is possible that pain developed de novo or became more serious after the PNES diagnosis. Other studies, however, suggested that development of new somatic complaints was not common, at least within the first six months after PNES diagnosis, and was similarly frequent in those whose PNES persisted as those whose PNES remitted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/73,195\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,195</a>].</p><p>Some of the risk factors inconsistently associated with a worse prognosis include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/2,7,8,33,35,73,74,127,162,173,188,196,197\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,8,33,35,73,74,127,162,173,188,196,197</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Longer duration of symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older age at onset</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower educational level, lower IQ</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More isolation, more limited family support</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dependent lifestyle</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No formal treatment plan</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unrelieved stressors (eg, ongoing abuse, family conflict)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anger, rejection of PNES diagnosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More severe underlying psychiatric disorder, especially severe or generalized somatization or dissociative symptoms</p><p/><p>Some studies have associated clinical semiology with prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/8,162,197\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,162,197</a>]. Patients with more dramatic motor features, self-injury, and prolonged episodes have a lower likelihood of remission than those with more passive or catatonic-like behaviors. However, the reason behind this association is unclear, and this finding is not universal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are events that clinically mimic epileptic seizures, but are not associated with physiological central nervous system dysfunction and are instead psychogenically determined.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PNES include a variety of clinical manifestations, some of which are suggestive, although not diagnostic, in distinguishing PNES from epileptic seizures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77773\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77773 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features of events'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of PNES is generally established by video-EEG monitoring, in which captured clinical events are examined in conjunction with electroencephalographic activity. Most patients with PNES will have an event within a few days of monitoring. The use of techniques to induce events is somewhat controversial, but can be helpful diagnostically, when patients do not have an event on monitoring. Other tests (interictal EEG, neuroimaging, neuropsychological tests, and laboratory studies) can be helpful in the evaluation of patients, but are generally not diagnostic of PNES. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frontal lobe seizures can have atypical clinical features and a normal ictal EEG and can be confused with PNES. Features that suggest that the events are frontal lobe seizures include short duration, stereotyped features, and occurrence during physiologic sleep. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of PNES, once established, should be presented to patients and their families in a supportive, nonjudgmental fashion. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Presenting the diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We believe that neurologic follow-up should be maintained after PNES diagnosis to monitor the safe withdrawal of antiseizure drugs, answer patient questions, and communicate with other treating physicians until such time as the patient has been fully transitioned to psychiatric care. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with PNES, we suggest psychotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We generally prefer cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) because it is the best-studied option in this patient population; reasonable alternatives include interpersonal therapy and group therapy. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacotherapy should be individualized according to the comorbid psychiatric diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis for patients with PNES is guarded. Many patients will continue to have seizure-like events. Patients with and without PNES remission may have substantial psychiatric morbidity and functional limitations on follow-up. Further studies are needed to identify effective psychiatric interventions for these patients.
