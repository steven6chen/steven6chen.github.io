Hirsutism may be the initial and possibly only sign of androgen excess, the cutaneous manifestations of which may also include acne and male-pattern balding (androgenetic alopecia). The pathophysiology and causes of androgen-mediated hair growth are reviewed here. Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hirsutism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hirsutism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H362638225\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Hair growth cycle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Humans are born with approximately five million hair follicles, and it is estimated that 80,000 to 150,000 of them are located on the scalp. Hair can be categorized as either vellus (fine, soft, and not pigmented) or terminal (long, coarse, and pigmented) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The number of hair follicles does not change over an individual's lifetime, but the follicle size and type of hair can change in response to numerous factors, particularly androgens.</p><p>The hair growth cycle is comprised of three phases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The growth phase (termed anagen), which varies by body area, is approximately four months for facial hair. Therefore, it takes approximately six months to detect the effects of hormonal therapy for facial hirsutism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The involutional phase (catagen), which lasts two to three weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The resting phase (telogen), which lasts three to four months. Hair is released from the hair follicle and shed at the end of telogen, and the next cycle is initiated. Telogen hairs are characterized by a mature root sheath or &quot;club&quot; at the proximal end.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3817270433\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of androgens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Androgens increase hair follicle size, hair fiber diameter, and the proportion of time terminal hairs spend in the anagen phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Androgen excess in women leads to increased hair growth in most androgen-sensitive sites (eg, upper lip, chin, midsternum, upper abdomen, back, and buttocks) but to loss of hair in the scalp region, in part by reducing the time scalp hairs spend in anagen phase.</p><p>Androgens are necessary for terminal hair and sebaceous gland development and cause differentiation of pilosebaceous units (PSUs) into either a terminal hair follicle or a sebaceous gland (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52814\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52814 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the former case, androgens transform the vellus hair into a terminal hair (a large medullated hair); in the latter, the sebaceous component proliferates and the hair remains vellus. In androgen-sensitive areas before puberty, the hair is vellus and the sebaceous glands are small. In response to increasing levels of androgens, PSUs become large terminal hair follicles in sexual hair areas or they become sebaceous follicles (sebaceous glands) in sebaceous areas. Androgens promote growth of sexual hair by recruiting a population of PSUs to switch from producing vellus hairs to initiating terminal hair growth.</p><p>Male-pattern hair growth occurs in sites where relatively high levels of androgen are necessary for PSU differentiation. Although androgen excess underlies most cases of hirsutism, there is only a modest correlation between the quantity of hair growth and serum testosterone concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism#H462317084\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism&quot;, section on 'Limitations'</a>). This is thought to result from the fact that stimulation of hair growth from the follicle does not depend solely on circulating androgen concentrations but also depends upon local factors and variability in end-organ sensitivity to circulating androgens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some data suggest that serum free or bioavailable testosterone concentrations correlate positively with hirsutism scores, while sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations correlate negatively with hirsutism scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Nearly all hirsute women have an increased production rate of androgens, usually testosterone, but the increase may not be sufficient to raise the serum total testosterone concentration above the normal range because the carrier protein for testosterone, SHBG, is suppressed when androgen production is increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].</p><p>In some women, hirsutism may be due to increased conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase within the PSU in peripheral tissue, including hair follicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3220702770\"><span class=\"h2\">Generalized hair growth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two conditions characterized by generalized hair growth that do not represent true hirsutism:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Androgen-independent hair, which is the soft vellus unpigmented hair that covers the entire body. In infants, this hair is called lanugo.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertrichosis, which refers to diffusely increased total body hair growth.

Hypertrichosis also can occur in patients with some systemic illnesses, such as hypothyroidism, anorexia nervosa, malnutrition, porphyria, and dermatomyositis, and as a paraneoplastic syndrome in some patients.

(See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Polycystic ovary syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p>A commonly used method to grade hair growth is a modified scale of Ferriman and Gallwey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Hirsutism in women of reproductive age is indicated by a total score &ge;8 in black or white women, but cutoff scores considered to be abnormal vary by race and ethnicity. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Ethnicity'</a> below.)</p><p>In a 1961 study of 430 British women aged 15 to 64 years attending a general medical clinic, 49 percent had hair on the lip, 22 percent had hair on the chin, 10 percent had hair on the chest, and no woman had terminal hair on the upper back or upper abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In most of the women who had hair in any region, however, there were rarely more than a few scattered hairs; thus, graded on a scale of 0 to 4 at nine sites (modified Ferriman-Gallwey scoring system), only 1.2 percent of women aged 18 to 38 years had scores above 10.</p><p>Although a total score &ge;8 is typically used to indicate hirsutism, lower scores have been associated with androgen excess disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, most women with a score above 3 consider themselves to be hirsute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism#H124279391\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism&quot;, section on 'Ferriman-Gallwey score'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Ethnicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definition of normal must also consider race and ethnicity. Most Asian and Native American women have little body hair, while Mediterranean women on average have substantially greater quantities of body hair even though serum androgen concentrations are similar in the three groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These differences must be kept in mind in determining whether a woman has a pathologic degree of hirsutism and whether she should be evaluated further. While a Ferriman-Gallwey score &ge;8 is considered to be abnormal in black and white women, the scores considered to be abnormal in other groups are &ge;9 to 10 in Mediterranean, Hispanic, and Middle Eastern women and &ge;2 to 3 for East Asian and Native American women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism#H124279391\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism&quot;, section on 'Ferriman-Gallwey score'</a>.)</p><p>Thus, an Asian woman with a few peri-areolar hairs may warrant further evaluation, whereas a Mediterranean woman with some hair growth on her upper lip might well be considered normal and consider herself normal. The most important consideration, whatever the woman's background, is whether the pattern of hair growth has changed or the rate of growth has increased. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism#H124279391\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism&quot;, section on 'Ferriman-Gallwey score'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hirsutism is a result of the interaction between circulating serum androgens and the sensitivity of the hair follicle to androgens. Several different androgens may be secreted in excess:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testosterone, which is usually of ovarian origin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), which is of adrenal origin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Androstenedione, which can be of either adrenal or ovarian origin</p><p/><p>Although DHEAS is a general marker of adrenal androgen production, it has little intrinsic androgenic activity. Small amounts are converted to androstenedione and then to testosterone (and to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estrone</a> and estradiol) in both the adrenal glands and peripheral tissues, including hair follicles and external genitalia. Thus, the hirsutism and virilization that may be seen with adrenal hyperandrogenism are caused by androstenedione and testosterone.</p><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of hirsutism. Other causes of androgen overproduction are infrequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In most populations of women with PCOS studied to date, testosterone is the predominant steroid secreted in excess; less often, androstenedione may be the predominant androgen that characterizes PCOS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65205\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65205 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Women with hirsutism may have an increase in 5-alpha reductase enzyme activity, increasing the rate of conversion of precursor to active intracellular androgen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Polycystic ovary syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PCOS is the most common cause of hirsutism in women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65205\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65205 \">table 1</a>). The syndrome is characterized by menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism, both clinical (hirsutism, acne, or male-pattern balding) and biochemical (elevated serum androgen concentrations). The diagnostic criteria, clinical manifestations, and treatment of PCOS are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One study prospectively evaluated 350 British women: 319 with hirsutism and 31 with frontal balding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Among the 282 women who had ovarian ultrasonography, 170 (60 percent) had polycystic ovaries; one-half of these women also had menstrual irregularity and, therefore, met the original criteria for PCOS. The remainder would have originally been considered to have idiopathic hirsutism but could perhaps now be considered to have PCOS using the newer Rotterdam PCOS diagnostic criteria. Only 2.3 percent (eight patients) had an identifiable endocrine disorder other than PCOS (congenital adrenal hyperplasia, ovarian tumor, virilizing adrenal carcinoma, prolactinoma, or acromegaly). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In two other series of 873 and 950 women presenting with androgen excess symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], PCOS was diagnosed (using the original criteria of oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenism) in 82 and 57 percent, respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The androgen excess in women with PCOS usually becomes evident about the time of puberty or soon thereafter because androgen production is increased by both puberty (increased ovarian steroid production) and adrenarche (increased adrenal androgen production). Other diagnoses such as ovarian or adrenal tumors should be considered in older women, particularly those who have rapid development of hirsutism <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other signs of hyperandrogenism or even virilization or have a sudden onset of menstrual irregularity.</p><p>The evaluation of hirsutism is complicated by the lack of reliable androgen assays and robust normative data in women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism&quot;, section on 'Biochemical testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Idiopathic hirsutism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of idiopathic hirsutism is given to women with hirsutism but normal serum androgen concentrations, no menstrual irregularity, and no identifiable cause of the hirsutism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/4,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,23,24</a>]. In some women, there may be a steroidogenic abnormality despite the apparently normal serum androgen levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The distinction between idiopathic disease and PCOS may be one of degree. As noted, many women who were previously considered to have idiopathic hirsutism would now be considered to have PCOS if using the newer Rotterdam PCOS diagnostic criteria. This is because most would meet two criteria for PCOS: clinical hyperandrogenism (hirsutism) and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, which has been reported in over 90 percent of women with &quot;idiopathic hirsutism&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

These disorders are usually recognized at birth or in early infancy, but nonclassic (also called late-onset) forms (primarily 21-hydroxylase deficiency) have been identified. Affected women present peripubertally with hirsutism and sometimes menstrual irregularity or primary amenorrhea; they have no manifestations of cortisol deficiency.</p><p>The prevalence of nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH) among hirsute women has varied from 1 to 15 percent in different studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>]. It is nearly always due to 21-hydroxylase (P450c21) deficiency, which leads to increased production of both 17-hydroxyprogesterone (the substrate for 21-hydroxylase and an androgen precursor) and androstenedione (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71558\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71558 \">figure 2</a>).

Women with hyperthecosis have high serum testosterone (not DHEAS), and symptoms tend to develop more gradually than in women with androgen-secreting tumors.

It is still unclear if hyperthecosis is a distinct disorder or is part of the spectrum of PCOS. The woman's history is usually one of gradual onset of hirsutism and frank virilization. Hyperthecosis is seen primarily in postmenopausal women, but it can occur in premenopausal women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-hyperthecosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian hyperthecosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2107267\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other uncommon causes of hirsutism include a number of endocrine disorders (including Cushing's syndrome) and drugs.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endocrine disorders</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cushing's disease &ndash; Adrenal overactivity due to a corticotroph adenoma secreting ACTH excessively results not only in excessive secretion of cortisol but also of adrenal androgens, typically resulting in hirsutism. Although the majority of women who have Cushing's disease have hirsutism, only a very small fraction of women with hirsutism have Cushing's disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome#H2129279981\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome&quot;, section on 'Signs of adrenal androgen excess'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hyperprolactinemia, acromegaly, and hypothyroidism are uncommon causes of hirsutism.

The marked hyperinsulinemia causes ovarian hyperandrogenism, possibly acting via the theca cell receptors for insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61896\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61896 \">figure 3</a>). Insulin also decreases SHBG concentrations, thereby increasing the fraction of serum testosterone that is free at any serum total testosterone concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The syndromes of severe insulin resistance include genetic defects in the insulin receptor, the production of antibodies to the insulin receptor, and several syndromes of lipoatrophy and lipodystrophy.

It may be the initial and possibly only sign of an underlying androgen disorder, the cutaneous manifestations of which may also include acne and male-pattern balding (androgenetic alopecia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of androgenetic alopecia in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depending upon the body site, hormonal regulation plays an important role in the hair growth cycle. Androgens increase hair follicle size, hair fiber diameter, and the proportion of time terminal hairs spend in the anagen phase. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Hair growth cycle'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Race and ethnicity are important determinants of body hair distribution in women. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Ethnicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of hirsutism. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Polycystic ovary syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of idiopathic hirsutism is given to women with hirsutism with normal serum androgen concentrations, no menstrual irregularity, and no identifiable cause of their hirsutism. However, if using the Rotterdam criteria for PCOS diagnosis, many women with idiopathic hirsutism would be considered to have a subtle form of PCOS. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Idiopathic hirsutism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other causes of hirsutism include nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, ovarian and adrenal androgen-secreting tumors, medications, and other rare disorders.
