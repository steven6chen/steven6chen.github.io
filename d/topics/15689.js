It happens when a tendon or bursa in the shoulder gets squeezed between the bones that make up the shoulder. A tendon is a strong band of tissue that connects a muscle to a bone. A bursa is a small fluid-filled sac that sits near a bone.</p><p>People can get shoulder impingement if they do a lot of work or a sport that involves stretching or lifting the arms overhead.</p><p>Shoulder impingement can lead to other problems, such as bursitis, which is when a bursa gets irritated or swollen; or rotator cuff injuries. The rotator cuff is made up of 4 shoulder muscles and their tendons.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21281305\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of shoulder impingement?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people have pain in the front of the shoulder. The pain is usually worse with lifting and reaching movements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21281312\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might. Your doctor or nurse will talk with you and do an exam. He or she might also do an X-ray or an ultrasound of your shoulder. (An ultrasound uses sound waves to create pictures of the inside of the body.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21281319\"><span class=\"h1\">How is shoulder impingement treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, the condition will get better on its own, but it can take weeks to months. To help your shoulder get better, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest your shoulder &ndash; Avoid reaching overhead or across your chest, lifting, leaning on your elbows, or lying on your shoulder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ice your shoulder &ndash; Put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the injured area every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time, as needed. Put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a pain-relieving medicine &ndash; Ask your doctor or nurse about taking an over-the-counter medicine, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand names: Aleve, Naprosyn).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21281326\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Different exercises can help your shoulder get better.</p><p>To keep your shoulder from getting too stiff, you can do an exercise called the pendulum stretch. To do this exercise, let your arm relax and hang down while you sit or stand. Move your arm back and forth, then side to side, and then around in small circles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F50148\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50148 \">figure 1</a>). Try to do this exercise for 5 minutes, 1 or 2 times a day.</p><p>Other types of exercises can help make the shoulder muscles stronger. Your doctor, nurse, or physical therapist (exercise expert) can show you how to do these types of exercises. He or she will tell you when to start them and how often to do them.</p><p>When you do shoulder exercises, it's important to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warm up your shoulder first by taking a hot shower or bath.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start slowly and make the exercises harder over time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Know that some soreness is normal. If you have sharp or tearing pain, stop what you're doing and let your doctor or nurse know.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21281333\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my symptoms don't get better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your symptoms don't get better, talk with your doctor or nurse about other possible treatments, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting a shot of medicine into the shoulder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21281340\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-injury-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rotator cuff injury (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bursitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bursitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=frozen-shoulder-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Frozen shoulder (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shoulder-impingement-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Shoulder impingement syndrome (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinitis-and-tear-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Rotator cuff tendinitis and tear (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bursitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bursitis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=frozen-shoulder-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Frozen shoulder (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
