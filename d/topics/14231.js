It is thought to be primarily a T cell mediated disease that occurs when immune cells transplanted from a non-identical donor (the graft) recognize the transplant recipient (the host) as foreign, thereby initiating an immune reaction that causes disease in the transplant recipient. The skin, gastrointestinal tract, and liver are the principal target organs in patients with acute GVHD.</p><p>Clinically significant acute GVHD occurs in 20 to 60 percent of patients who receive an allogeneic HCT, despite intensive prophylaxis with immunosuppressive agents. The development of moderate (grade II) or severe (grade III or IV) acute GVHD is associated with a significant decrease in survival. As such, all patients receiving an allogeneic HCT receive prophylaxis for acute GVHD.</p><p>This prevention of acute GVHD will be discussed here. The diagnosis and management of acute GVHD and the pathogenesis of GVHD are presented separately.

The reason for the focus on prophylaxis is twofold. First, the development of moderate (grade II) or severe (grade III or IV) acute GVHD is associated with significant morbidity, and severe GVHD is associated with a significant decrease in survival. Second, once GVHD occurs, it may not respond to treatment. Without prophylaxis, the incidence of clinically significant GVHD varies depending upon the degree of HLA mismatch and the type of transplantation, but may be as high as 70 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. With prophylaxis, the incidence of acute GVHD is decreased, but not eliminated. Risk factors for acute GVHD and grading of acute GVHD are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease#H25782802\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;, section on 'Grading'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4622221\"><span class=\"h2\">Balancing GVHD and GVT effect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With nonidentical transplants, donor cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) may recognize neoplastic cells as foreign due to the expression of epitopes unique to the host (and the underlying malignancy). CTLs may subsequently become activated, lysing such cells. This graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect is very similar to that which underlies GVHD. Although GVHD prophylaxis is clearly effective, an important concern had been that such therapy would also diminish the GVT effect, increasing the likelihood of recurrent disease.</p><p>The potential importance of a GVT effect was illustrated in a review from 163 transplant centers that compared the results of 103 identical twin (syngeneic) and 1030 HLA-identical sibling (allogeneic) transplants for leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The three-year probability of relapse of leukemia was substantially higher in the syngeneic than allogeneic transplants in acute myeloid leukemia (52 versus 16 percent) and chronic myeloid leukemia (40 versus 7 percent); the GVT effect was less apparent and not statistically significant in acute lymphoid leukemia (36 versus 26 percent).</p><p>In the past, investigators would attempt to minimize or avoid immunosuppression in the hopes that a GVT effect would occur. However, with the advent of donor leukocyte infusions for the treatment of recurrent leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], avoiding GVHD prophylaxis became less attractive as a method to decrease relapses. As a result, almost all allogeneic HCT currently use some form of prophylaxis.</p><p>The presence of GVHD remains the most important post-transplant factor influencing outcome following allogeneic HCT. As the severity of acute GVHD increases, treatment-related mortality (TRM) rises and the risk of relapse decreases. As an example, in a study of 4174 HLA-identical sibling transplants for chronic myeloid leukemia in first chronic phase, acute GVHD of grades III and IV significantly increased TRM during the first 100 days post-transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For the period from 100 days to three years post-transplant, hazard ratios (HR) for TRM increased with increasing grades of acute GVHD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 0 &ndash; HR for TRM 1.0</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade I &ndash; HR 1.5 (95% CI 1.2-2.0)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade II &ndash; HR 2.5 (95% CI 2.0-3.1)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade III &ndash; HR 5.8 (95% CI 4.4-7.5)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade IV &ndash; HR 14.7 (95% CI 11-20)</p><p/><p>Conversely, increasing degrees of acute GVHD reduced the risk of relapse:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 0 &ndash; HR for relapse 1.0</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade I &ndash; HR 0.94 (95% CI 0.8-1.2)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade II &ndash; HR 0.60 (95% CI 0.5-0.8)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade III &ndash; HR 0.48 (95% CI 0.3-0.8)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade IV &ndash; HR 0.14 (95% CI 0.02-0.99)</p><p/><p>As such, the application of GVHD prophylaxis must balance the benefit of reducing GVHD with the potential harm of decreasing the GVT effect. The separation of GVHD from GVT is an attractive clinical goal that has yet to be achieved in humans. Such separation would allow for suppression of GVHD without the impairment of the GVT effect and would be a major advance in the field of HCT.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>The following issues related to donor selection and preparative regimen may be considered to minimize the incidence of acute GVHD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Donor selection should always aim to minimize HLA disparity. Sibling donors, when available, are usually preferred to matched unrelated donors. The importance of HLA disparity may vary by graft source. As an example, despite the infusion of HLA class I and II disparate grafts, the incidence and severity of acute GVHD among unrelated umbilical cord blood recipients has thus far been lower than previously reported in recipients of matched unrelated donor marrow or partially-matched family member marrow allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Nulliparous females and male donors are preferred over parous female donors to reduce the risk of an anamnestic response to antigen exposure during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A decision regarding the ideal conditioning regimen is based upon clinical judgement that takes into account details regarding the recipient comorbidities, underlying condition and disease status, donor, and graft source. Myeloablative regimens are associated with a higher risk of GVHD than reduced intensity or nonmyeloablative regimens. However, they may be necessary for disease control, especially in the setting of refractory leukemia or lymphoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H89394187\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparative regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Choice of preparative regimen'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While the conditioning regimen of choice is often dictated by the underlying disorder, the source of donor stem cells (bone marrow, peripheral blood, umbilical cord) may be selected in the context of the planned conditioning regimen to minimize acute GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A bone marrow or umbilical cord graft may be preferred in the setting of myeloablative conditioning, while peripheral blood progenitor cells may be preferred in the setting of reduced intensity conditioning.

There is no agreed upon standard regimen, and clinical practice varies by institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, each institution must have guidelines for the prevention and management of GVHD in order to be acknowledged by the international accrediting organizations for transplant centers (Joint Accreditation Committee for ISCT Europe and EBMT [JACIE] and Foundation for the Accreditation of Cell Therapy [FACT]). Guidelines for GVHD prophylaxis have been proposed by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and European LeukemiaNet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F91020\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91020 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Our approach is generally consistent with these guidelines.</p><p>A choice among regimens must take into consideration the underlying disease, the degree of HLA disparity, the conditioning regimen, and patient characteristics.

ATG is most commonly used for patients at the highest risk of chronic GVHD, such as those undergoing unrelated donor transplantation or HLA-haploidentical transplantation.

For most patients undergoing either myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning, we suggest the addition of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) to the prophylactic regimen. While regimens may vary by clinical institution, a specific institution should be internally consistent and have written institutional guidelines.</p><p>The recommendations given in this review and those of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and European LeukemiaNet were designed to apply to the most common allogeneic HCT setting: adults with standard risk malignant disease undergoing transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling or unrelated donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Cyclosporine is administered to reach a therapeutic target concentration, which varies according to the time from transplantation. A target concentration of 200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> is used during the first three to four weeks; then, if there is no GVHD, the target concentration is decreased to 100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> until three months after transplantation, and then tapered further.

While practice varies by institution, the day +11 methotrexate dose should be decreased or omitted if there is any grade II or worse toxicity. The urine should be alkalinized to a pH above 7.0 with bicarbonate to aid in the excretion of methotrexate and to minimize its precipitation in the tubules, which can lead to acute renal failure. This can be achieved by the administration of roughly 3 liters per day of dextrose in water to which 44 to 66 mEq of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> has been added.

ATG is a polyclonal immunoglobulin directed against human T lymphocytes. The interest in ATG for GVHD prophylaxis is based upon the understanding that GVHD is caused by donor T lymphocytes. The addition of ATG to other GVHD prophylaxis regimens decreases the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD and allows more patients to discontinue pharmacologic prophylaxis for acute GVHD, but has not demonstrated a survival benefit. In addition, the use of ATG after HCT has been associated with an increase in post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

While the overall incidence of GVHD was not significantly different, patients who received ATG had a lower incidence of severe (grade II to IV) GVHD (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.55-0.85), with a number needed to treat of eight patients.

After a median follow-up of 24 months, the addition of ATG resulted in a lower cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD (32 versus 69 percent) and a higher percentage of patients able to discontinue cyclosporine (91 versus 39 percent). Rates of acute GVHD, RFS, and OS at two years were similar between the two groups. The two groups also had similar rates of cytomegalovirus reactivation and Epstein-Barr virus reactivation, and no cases of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a second multicenter trial, 203 patients undergoing myeloablative or nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT from an unrelated donor for a hematologic malignancy were randomly assigned to receive standard GVHD prophylaxis with or without rabbit ATG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

The impact on chronic GVHD is important and contributes to improved quality of life. For this reason, we suggest that ATG be included as part of GVHD prophylaxis.

The pathogenesis of GVHD is a complex, multistep process, but is primarily a T cell mediated process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Development of moderate (grade II) and, more importantly, severe (grade III or IV) acute GVHD after marrow transplantation is associated with a significant decrease in survival. In addition, once GVHD occurs, it may not respond to treatment. As such, all patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) require GVHD prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H4622215\" class=\"local\">'Disease burden'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prophylaxis of acute GVHD centers on immunosuppression of the donor cells, either pharmacologically or via T cell depletion. There is no agreed upon standard regimen and clinical practice varies by institution. However, each institution must have guidelines for the prevention and management of GVHD in order to be acknowledged by international accrediting organizations. (See <a href=\"#H4622255\" class=\"local\">'Choice of prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A choice among regimens must take into consideration the underlying disease, the degree of HLA disparity, the conditioning regimen, and patient characteristics.

Dose attenuation should be considered for elevations of creatinine or bilirubin or the presence of grade III to IV mucositis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Calcineurin inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>) are initially administered intravenously, followed by an oral formulation when patients are able to eat sufficiently. Drug levels are followed carefully to maintain a therapeutic range and avoid toxicities. Many different drugs have been implicated in increasing or decreasing calcineurin levels in patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F109680\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109680 \">table 3</a>). In addition, calcineurin inhibitors are nephrotoxic and the concomitant administration of other nephrotoxic drugs should be followed carefully.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of acute GVHD can be made readily on clinical grounds in the patient who presents with a classic maculopapular rash, abdominal cramps with diarrhea, and a rising serum bilirubin concentration within the first 100 days following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), most often within two to three weeks following HCT. In many cases, however, the diagnosis is less straightforward and competing causes for isolated abnormalities must be considered and excluded.
