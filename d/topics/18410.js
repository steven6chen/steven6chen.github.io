The rate of angiographic restenosis following balloon angioplasty alone (defined as 50 percent or greater reduction in luminal diameter at follow-up angiography) is 40 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. About half of the patients with angiographic restenosis manifest clinical restenosis with recurrent ischemia that leads to repeat revascularization of the targeted vessel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Intracoronary stents, by virtue of their ability to prevent elastic recoil and constrictive remodeling, initially reduced the frequency of angiographic restenosis to approximately 20 percent and the need for repeat revascularization to approximately 10 to 12 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71236\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71236 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Even better results have been obtained with drug-eluting stents, which are the stents of choice for most coronary interventions currently (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53472\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53472 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-eluting intracoronary stents: General principles&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prior to the availability of drug-eluting stents, one major focus of investigation to treat restenosis was the use of intracoronary radiation. Based upon the data presented below, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved both gamma and beta intracoronary radiation for use in the treatment of in-stent restenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This technique is applied immediately after mechanical treatment (usually balloon dilatation) of the stent restenosis. However, the increased efficacy of drug-eluting stents for in-stent restenosis has markedly limited the role of intracoronary radiation for this indication.</p><p>Data do not support the use of intracoronary radiation for the prevention of restenosis after treating de novo lesions with balloon angioplasty alone, and the FDA has not approved this technique for this indication. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Comparison to drug-eluting stents'</a> below.)</p><p>Another radiation approach, insertion of radioactive stents, has been demonstrated to cause an increase in restenosis at the edges of the stent and may delay rather than prevent restenosis within the stent itself. The development of these stents has been discontinued. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale of using ionizing radiation to prevent restenosis is derived from the observed benefit of radiation in reducing exuberant wound healing following surgery. In porcine models, application of endovascular radiation inhibited neointimal formation after balloon injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. These benefits may be mediated by apoptosis (programmed cell death), inhibition of the first wave of cellular proliferation, and prevention of adventitial fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Radiation can be delivered over the course of 3 to 30 minutes (depending upon the isotope and its activity) via percutaneously inserted catheters containing radioactive wires, balloons, ribbons, or seeds. Most studies have used gamma radiation from an Ir-192 source, which is highly penetrating in human tissue and falls off according to the inverse square law. Other studies have used shorter range beta particles from a Sr-90, P-32, or I-125 source, which have a range of only a few millimeters in tissue and yield lower whole-body dose exposure for a corresponding dose to the arterial wall. Because of this intense local absorption, beta brachytherapy can be delivered in much shorter dwell times and with much less shielding of the laboratory staff.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term results after radiotherapy may be influenced by the radiation dose, the homogeneity of dose distribution, the complexity of the stenotic lesion, and vessel injury at the time of radiation delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. In early studies, the effect of increasing the beta-emitter dose was evaluated in a report of 130 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) without stenting who were randomly assigned to receive 9, 12, 15, or 18 Gy of radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. At six months, the restenosis rate was 28, 17, 16, and 4 percent, respectively. The rate of repeat revascularization with a dose of 9 and 18 Gy was 18 and 6 percent, respectively and there was a dose-dependent enlargement of the vessel lumen.</p><p>Intracoronary radiation using a fixed dose of 15 Gy is less effective in longer in-stent restenotic lesions, due to greater eccentricity and variability in lesion geometry and longer source-to-target distances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, efficacy is improved with the use of higher doses (18 Gy at 2 mm from the source) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Scattering after stenting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A concern with the use of radiotherapy after stenting is the potential for absorption and scattering, especially of short-range beta particles, by stent struts that may cause significant variations in the uniformity and magnitude of the radiation dose. Thinner strut stents result in less radiation dose perturbation than previously popular thicker strut stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, the clinical significance of these differences is uncertain. As described below, trials using beta-emitters for in-stent restenosis have shown benefit that appears roughly similar to that seen in trials of more penetrating gamma radiation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracoronary-stent-restenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracoronary stent restenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brachytherapy is effective in treating restenosis occurring after either balloon angioplasty or stenting. Some long-term data from clinical trials suggest that radiation may delay, rather than prevent, restenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Use for in-stent restenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low dose brachytherapy has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as adjunctive treatment for in-stent restenosis; it appears to act by inhibiting recurrent exuberant neointimal formation within the stent, without any effect at the stent edge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The benefit and clinical outcomes with intracoronary radiation are independent of the primary method used to treat in-stent restenosis (balloon angioplasty, excimer laser angioplasty, rotational atherectomy, or additional stent implantation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In addition, intracoronary radiation is effective in all vessel sizes, with benefit greatest in small vessel (&lt;2.5 mm) and all lesion lengths, especially in diffuse lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracoronary-stent-restenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracoronary stent restenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although both beta and gamma radiation have similar benefit in preventing recurrence of in-stent restenosis, most laboratories prefer the beta systems because of their shorter treatment times (typically 3 versus 30 minutes) and the lack of requirement for significant lead shielding to protect the operator and staff.</p><p>A significant clinical benefit has been noted with intracoronary radiation in a number of published trials using a gamma emitter (Gamma-One, WRIST, Long WRIST) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>] or a beta emitter (INHIBIT, Beta WRIST, and START) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].

At nine months, the primary end point (death, myocardial infarction, or need for target lesion revascularization) was significantly lower with intracoronary gamma radiation (28 versus 44 percent for placebo), due entirely to a reduction in target lesion revascularization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The WRIST trial included 130 patients with in-stent restenosis who underwent a successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and were then randomly assigned to either intracoronary radiation with a gamma emitter or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

However, in the interval between six months and five years, radiation was associated with significantly more target lesion revascularization (22 versus 5 percent), suggesting that radiation may have delayed, but not prevented, the development of restenosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Long WRIST trial demonstrated the benefit of intracoronary radiation in 240 patients with long in-stent lesions (36 to 80 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The first 120 patients were randomly assigned to either gamma irradiation at a dose of 15 Gy or placebo; subsequently, an additional 120 patients were treated with 18 Gy. At six months, patients assigned to high dose radiation (18 Gy), low dose radiation (15 Gy), or placebo had target lesion revascularization rates of 20, 39, and 62 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p>The benefit of radiotherapy was more pronounced in diabetic patients in the WRIST trial and in a retrospective review of 749 patients at a single center, 43 percent of whom were diabetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although the outcomes were similar in nondiabetics and diabetics treated with radiation, higher rates of restenosis occurred in the diabetics in the placebo group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

At nine months, radiotherapy significantly reduced the incidence of in-lesion restenosis (16 versus 48 percent for placebo), in-vessel restenosis (26 versus 52 percent), and major adverse cardiac effects (death, Q wave MI, and target lesion revascularization; 15 versus 31 percent).

In addition, approximately 10 to 15 percent of failures were determined by angiography, not by symptoms or stress testing, which may have overestimated the true failure rate.</p><p>Similar findings were noted in a smaller study of 45 patients with restenosis after intracoronary irradiation in the Gamma-One and Gamma-Two trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Repeat percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was acutely successful in all patients but subsequent restenosis occurred in 15 (33 percent), requiring yet another revascularization procedure, either surgical or percutaneous.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The association of late thrombosis with a new stent and discontinuation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticlopidine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticlopidine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> led the FDA to recommend avoidance of placement of new stents when brachytherapy is used, if possible, and to continue dual antiplatelet therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine) for a minimum of six months after brachytherapy and for at least one year if a new stent is implanted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The potential efficacy of prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy has been demonstrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the WRIST PLUS trial of 120 patients with diffuse in-stent restenosis, six months of therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> was associated with the need for a new stent in 28 percent of patients and an incidence of total occlusion and late thrombosis of 5.8 and 2.5 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. These rates were lower than those seen with radiation therapy in the WRIST and LONG WRIST trials in which antiplatelet therapy was given for only one month and were similar to those in the placebo group in these trials.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the WRIST 12 trial, 120 patients with diffuse in-stent restenosis were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for one year; the results were compared to those in WRIST PLUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Although there was no difference in late thrombosis at 15 months in the two groups (3.3 and 4.2 percent), prolonged antiplatelet therapy was associated with a significant reduction in target vessel revascularization (20 versus 35 percent). Only four patients in these two studies developed late thrombosis while still taking clopidogrel.</p><p/><p>These findings have led many clinicians to continue dual antiplatelet therapy for one year after intracoronary radiation therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Edge stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Edge restenosis, which was originally described with the use of radioactive stents, also occurs with intracoronary radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. In the WRIST trial, for example, the incidence of edge stenosis was 10 percent with intracoronary radiation compared to 4.7 percent with placebo after successful treatment of in-stent restenosis with PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>The development of edge stenosis is enhanced by &quot;geographic miss&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. This term refers to failure of the radiation source to adequately cover the entire segment of artery injured during the PCI that is performed in conjunction with the radiation therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70164\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70164 \">figure 4</a>). Edge stenosis can be avoided by use of a radiation source at least 10 mm longer than the mechanically treated segment and careful positioning of both dilating balloons and the radiation source.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Delayed healing of dissections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild to moderate dissections are not uncommon after angioplasty, and usually resolve completely. Only limited data are available on the effect of intracoronary radiation on the healing of a dissection. One report reviewed 44 patients with postangioplasty dissections who underwent intracoronary ultrasonography at six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. At this time, residual dissection was present in only 1 of 28 patients who did not receive intracoronary radiation compared to 7 of 16 who did (3.5 versus 44 percent). In the latter group, however, there was a significant improvement in the dissection and an increase in lumen area. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periprocedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;, section on 'Dissection and abrupt closure after PTCA'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Coronary artery spasm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Animal and clinical studies have demonstrated an incidence as high as 67 percent of coronary artery spasm after high-dose (24 Gy) beta irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Spasm occurred immediately, proximal and distal to the stent, and is due to endothelial dysfunction. Although the spasm was usually minor or moderate, ECG changes or hemodynamic instability were seen in almost 30 percent of cases. Repetitive administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> is an effective therapy in this situation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brachytherapy using either gamma or beta radiation sources became a common treatment for in-stent restenosis prior to the availability of drug-eluting coronary stents, since it substantially reduced recurrent restenosis. It can be particularly helpful in treating long lesions, which are more subject to recurrent restenosis. The procedure has a favorable safety profile, especially if dual antiplatelet therapy is continued for an extended period (up to one year) to reduce occurrences of late thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>However, two randomized trials (TAXUS V ISR and SISR) demonstrated significantly better outcomes in terms of angiographic restenosis and target lesion revascularization with drug-eluting stents compared to intracoronary radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. As a result, drug-eluting stents should be the initial treatment of in-stent restenosis in the majority of patients. This is reflected in the 2011 American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">Foundation/American</span> Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/Society</span> for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions Guideline for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Comparison to drug-eluting stents'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracoronary-stent-restenosis#H555826772\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracoronary stent restenosis&quot;, section on 'Choice of device'</a>.)</p><p>With drug-eluting stents used for the treatment of in-stent restenosis in most patients, the use of brachytherapy has declined and it is available at relatively few centers. However, based on the evidence base presented above, its use may still be considered in certain instances of in-stent restenosis: Typically, it may be considered after recurrent in-stent restenosis after an initial treatment with a drug-eluting stent has failed. &#160;</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-radiation-to-prevent-restenosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Detre K, Holubkov R, Kelsey S, et al.
