This approach is based upon the beneficial results reported in several large prospective randomized trials in children, extensive observational studies in children and adults, and a very limited number of small randomized controlled trials in adults that compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> with no specific therapy or that compared various glucocorticoid regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. Due to their small size, the results of these controlled trials are not definitive.</p><p>MCD accounts for 90 percent of cases of the idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in young children (under age six years) and 65 percent of cases in older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. As a result, glucocorticoid therapy is usually begun empirically in children, and a kidney biopsy is performed only for glucocorticoid-resistant disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By comparison, MCD accounts for only 10 to 25 percent of cases of nephrotic syndrome in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Thus, patients over age 16 years are generally treated after kidney biopsy that shows MCD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of minimal change disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Children tend to remit rapidly, with 50 percent responding within two weeks and almost all within eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>]. Adults tend to respond more slowly, with more than 25 percent of responders taking three to four months or longer to undergo complete remission (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58623\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58623 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>]. Therefore, the definition of steroid resistance is not the same for patients younger than about 16 years of age and for those over about 17 years of age.</p><p>The treatment of MCD in adults will be reviewed here. The treatment of other frequent causes of the nephrotic syndrome occurring in adults, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and primary amyloidosis, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of idiopathic membranous nephropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis and light and heavy chain deposition diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential efficacy of therapy must be considered in relation to the natural history of the disease. Historically, untreated idiopathic minimal change disease (MCD) was associated with a high<strong> </strong>risk of mortality due to infection and thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/12,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,18</a>]. Survivors remitted slowly but spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].<strong> </strong>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal vein thrombosis and hypercoagulable state in nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of heavy proteinuria and the nephrotic syndrome&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.) </p><p>Limited data suggest that the rate of spontaneous early remission (eg, within a few months) in adults is approximately 5 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/2,15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15,19</a>]. In addition, a substantial proportion of untreated patients eventually undergo remission after a prolonged period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/2,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17</a>]. In a series of 51 patients, 33 percent had a spontaneous remission at some time during the disease course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This was illustrated in the only available randomized controlled trial that, in 1970, compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> versus no specific therapy and included 31 patients with MCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Remission of proteinuria to less than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> in the control group occurred in 50 percent by 18 months and in approximately 70 percent at three years. However, the dose of prednisone was less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> which is much lower than the commonly recommended dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span>. The chief benefit of glucocorticoid is to induce and maintain remission until the poorly understood process responsible for MCD abates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">KIDNEY FAILURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although many patients with minimal change disease (MCD) have a modest decrease in the glomerular filtration rate during the nephrotic phase, this may represent &quot;functional renal insufficiency&quot; as kidney function returns to normal following resolution of the nephrotic syndrome, even after multiple relapses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/13-15,17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15,17,19</a>]. In a series of 51 patients, 61 percent had higher-than-normal serum creatinine values when patients were actively nephrotic, but renal function returned to normal when remission was achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In adults, the nephrotic syndrome may also be associated with a rise in blood pressure over pre-nephrotic baseline levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Acute kidney failure can occur in idiopathic MCD, and sometimes, the glomerular filtration rate does not fully recover to baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This complication is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute kidney injury (AKI) in minimal change disease and other forms of nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>End-stage renal disease is rare and has only been reported in steroid-resistant cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/15,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20</a>]. However, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is often seen on a late kidney biopsy in patients with glucocorticoid-resistant disease and in all patients who develop progressive renal failure. Whether this represents sampling error on the initial kidney biopsy due to the focal nature of FSGS, or true progression from MCD to FSGS, is uncertain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Response to therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The outcome of treated MCD is favorable, with the great majority of patients eventually attaining complete remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/12,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,20,21</a>]. The most important prognostic factor appears to be the initial response to corticosteroid therapy.</p><p>The classification of response to therapy is based upon the relative reduction in proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/13,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,22</a>]. The following are commonly used definitions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A complete response (remission) is a reduction in proteinuria to &lt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (or &lt;200 mg per g of creatinine).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A partial response is a reduction in proteinuria of 50 percent, with absolute values between 300 mg and 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span>. Another study defined partial remission as proteinuria less than 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> with a normal serum albumin concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. We feel that partial remission lasting more than two weeks is an unusual event in MCD, occurring in only 2 of 51 patients in the latter study. Furthermore, one can never be certain that such partial responders do not actually have FSGS that was missed on kidney biopsy since MCD is almost always an all-or-none disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A relapse is return of proteinuria to approximately 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> or greater in patients who had previously undergone a complete or partial remission. Patients are considered frequent relapsers if they have three or more relapses per year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoid dependence refers to relapse while on therapy or requirement for continuation of steroids to maintain remission.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoid resistance refers to little or no reduction in proteinuria after 16 weeks of adequate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> therapy, or to the rare patients who have some reduction in proteinuria with more prolonged therapy but do not meet the criteria for partial remission.</p><p/><p>Glucocorticoid therapy leads to complete remission in 80 to over 95 percent of adults with MCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/2,13-17,19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13-17,19,22</a>]. The time course to a complete remission is prolonged, with 50 percent responding by four weeks and 10 to 25 percent requiring more than three to four months of therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58623\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58623 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/2,15-17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15-17,19</a>]. By contrast, most children will respond within four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Approximately 50 to 75 percent of glucocorticoid-responsive adults will have a relapse, and frequent relapses occur in 10 to 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/15,17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17,19</a>]. Steroid dependence is seen in 25 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19</a>].</p><p>Remissions are typically abrupt, with the patient being free of proteinuria within two to three weeks from the time of initial response. In a majority of cases, response to therapy of nephrotic MCD is of an &quot;all or nothing&quot; type. Partial responses are not characteristic of MCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and, when seen, one should suspect a possible misdiagnosis, most often FSGS that was missed by sampling error. An exception is the &quot;Tip Lesion&quot; variant of FSGS, whose response to steroid treatment is comparable to that of MCD.</p><p>Most relapses occur within one year after glucocorticoid therapy has been tapered or discontinued, although occasional patients have a glucocorticoid-responsive relapse after as long as 25 years in remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/3,13,15,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13,15,24</a>]. Relapses may be triggered by allergies or infections, especially viral infections. In one study of 51 patients, for example, an allergic episode triggered a relapse in 17 cases and a viral infection in 17 other patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In such cases, the relapse can last for a limited period of time and may respond to a short treatment, often within one month.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonimmunosuppressive therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adults with minimal change disease (MCD) are edematous and often hypertensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. First-line therapy is a low-sodium diet and diuretics for fluid removal. If antihypertensive therapy is still required, use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) seems a reasonable option for blood pressure reduction and may have the added benefit of reducing urinary protein excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Calcium channel antagonists are not a good option as they may produce lower limb edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-and-safety-of-calcium-channel-blockers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects and safety of calcium channel blockers&quot;</a>.)</p><p>ACE inhibitors or ARBs to prevent progression to renal insufficiency, or statin therapy for hyperlipidemia, are not required in normotensive glucocorticoid-sensitive MCD. However, these and other nonimmunosuppressive therapies are warranted in the rare patients with persistent nephrotic syndrome despite immunosuppressive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Persistent nephrotic syndrome'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of heavy proteinuria and the nephrotic syndrome&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H445388988\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunosuppressive therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H445388995\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoid therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids may have a specific, beneficial antiproteinuric effect on the glomerular filtration barrier in addition to their immunosuppressive effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>The mainstay of initial therapy of MCD is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>, with a large percentage of adults, particularly younger patients, achieving complete remission within a few months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58623\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58623 \">figure 1</a>). Approximately 7 to 12 percent of adults with MCD do not respond to initial glucocorticoid therapy and are considered to have resistant disease. Such patients should be suspected of having focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) that was not detected with the kidney biopsy due to sampling error. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid-resistant MCD'</a> below.) </p><p>The recommendation for initial therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> in adults is based upon the beneficial results reported in several large prospective randomized trials in children, extensive observational studies in children and adults, and a single randomized controlled trial published in 1970 that compared low-dose prednisone (&lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> with no specific therapy among 31 adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In this randomized trial, over 75 percent of low-dose prednisone-treated patients had remission of proteinuria to less than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> within six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. By comparison, only 50 percent of those in the untreated group were in remission at 18 months and approximately 70 percent at three years. There are no randomized trials comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> with other agents for the initial therapy of idiopathic MCD in adults.</p><p>Although 5 to 10 percent spontaneously remitted within three months in the untreated group in the randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], we do not recommend withholding glucocorticoid therapy in an attempt to identify such patients. Such an approach exposes patients to the thrombotic and infectious hazards of persistent nephrotic syndrome and, in an older study in children, was associated with appreciable mortality from infection and thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>As noted in several large prospective trials, almost all children (95 percent or more) with MCD respond to corticosteroid therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58623\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58623 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In adults, numerous retrospective observational studies have demonstrated a high response rate in patients treated with relatively long courses of high-dose daily or alternate-day steroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/1,13-15,17,19,22,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13-15,17,19,22,28-30</a>]. The following summarizes the initial therapy, glucocorticoid taper, and relevant results of some of the larger series in adults:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 57 patients (mean age 38 years) treated initially with 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>, 58 and 67 percent achieved a complete remission within four and eight weeks, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. An additional nine patients (15 percent) subsequently entered a complete remission with continuation of high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, whereas six (10 percent) remitted following the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>. The remaining three patients had a partial remission that may have reflected underlying FSGS. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Response to therapy'</a> above.)<br/><br/>After attaining remission, prednisolone was tapered by 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span> until reaching 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day;</span> this dose was continued for a mean of 2.5 years. Relapses occurred in 62 percent, with most occurring during the first 6 to 12 months. Prednisolone alone at a reduced dose (20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> successfully treated relapses in 75 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One retrospective observational study of 88 patients (mean age 45 years) reported similar efficacy with daily steroids (initial dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, 65 patients) and alternate-day steroids (initial dose of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every other day, 23 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. There was no difference in the incidence of remissions (76 and 74 percent for daily and alternate-day groups, respectively), time to remission (11 and 16 weeks), relapse rate (75 and 62 percent), or time to relapse (20 and 26 weeks).<br/><br/>For daily therapy, the time when the taper was initiated and the exact glucocorticoid taper regimen were not specified, but gradual glucocorticoid withdrawal occurred for a total duration of therapy of 26 weeks. With alternate-day therapy, steroids were administered initially at 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every other day for six to eight weeks, then decreased by 20 mg at two-week intervals until 40 mg every other day was reached; this was followed by a slower taper based upon clinical response.

Rituximab has been used for the treatment of various glomerulopathies, including MCD (adults and children), membranous nephropathy, FSGS, and recurrent FSGS following kidney transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/53-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-58</a>]. The data pertaining to the use of rituximab in children with MCD are discussed elsewhere.

Thus, we suggest rituximab therapy be attempted in such patients who have also failed to attain a durable remission with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or calcineurin inhibitors. By contrast, rituximab does <strong>not</strong> appear to be effective in adults with glucocorticoid-resistant MCD and therefore should be avoided in these patients. </p><p>As an example, one study assessed the efficacy and safety of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> in 17 adult patients with glucocorticoid-dependent MCD over a mean follow-up of 29.5 months (range 5.1 to 82 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Remission was achieved in eleven patients after rituximab infusion (mean follow-up of 26.7 months), and nine of these patients were able to discontinue all other immunosuppressive drugs. Six patients relapsed at least once after rituximab (mean time to relapse, 11.9 months), although other immunosuppressive therapies were successfully discontinued or reduced during this period.

In addition, levamisole is not available in some countries, including the United States. Considering the very limited published experience of levamisole in adults, this treatment should be reserved to pediatric nephrology units having an expertise in using this drug.

A longer course of daily therapy induces remission in some of these cases. In children who do not respond by four weeks, a failure to respond to a trial of pulse <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> is considered indicative of glucocorticoid resistance.

Histologic examination will show either FSGS or MCD. However, if MCD is again seen, one cannot exclude underlying FSGS that was missed by sampling error.
