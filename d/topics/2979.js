CCFs can present with a variety of signs and symptoms. Many lesions are associated with significant neuro-ophthalmologic morbidity and mortality. Treatment decisions require multiple considerations: the nature of the symptoms, the location of the lesion, the complexity of the angioarchitecture, and the risk of visual and neurologic morbidity.</p><p>This topic discusses the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of CCFs. Other vascular malformations of the central nervous system are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brain-arteriovenous-malformations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brain arteriovenous malformations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular malformations of the central nervous system&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2073830\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CCFs arise from abnormal communications between the carotid arteries and the cavernous sinus.</p><p>CCFs may be high- or low-flow lesions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-flow CCFs result from a direct connection between the intracavernous carotid artery and the surrounding cavernous sinus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-flow CCFs represent a subtype of dural fistula resulting from indirect communication between the cavernous sinus and branches of the internal or external carotid artery within the adjacent dura. These are often referred to as cavernous dural fistulas or dural CCFs.</p><p/><p>In the Barrow classification, CCFs are further subdivided into four types based on their etiology, rate of flow, and source of feeder vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Type A CCFs are direct, high-flow lesions connecting the carotid artery and cavernous sinus, and they often result from a single, endothelialized tear in the carotid wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Types B, C, and D fistulas are low-flow, indirect lesions that vary by anatomy. The arterial supply of Type B lesions arises from small branches of the cavernous carotid artery, Type C from dural branches of the external carotid, and Type D from a combination of external and internal carotid artery (ICA) branches. Barrow type B, C, and D fistulas are often referred to as cavernous dural fistulas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4626648\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimates of the incidence of CCFs are not documented in the literature. Overall, CCFs are found equally in men and women and can occur in any age group, including young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Occurring most often as a consequence of traumatic injury, direct CCFs were found in one study to occur in up to 4 percent of patients who had sustained a basilar skull fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As with other traumatic injuries, young men are the demographic group most often affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. By contrast, dural CCFs (Barrow type B-D) are somewhat more common in older women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2073837\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CCFs may arise spontaneously or from secondary causes, including trauma, cavernous carotid aneurysm, venous thrombosis, and genetic conditions associated with arterial wall defects. In many cases, no cause can be identified.</p><p>The majority of direct, type A CCFs result from head trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/5,6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,13</a>]. Symptoms may manifest immediately or be delayed for days or weeks. The trauma is generally severe and is accompanied by skull or facial fractures. Post-traumatic CCFs are bilateral in 1 to 2 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>The exact mechanism by which the CCF results from trauma is uncertain. Hypotheses include a tear in the artery from a bony fracture or shear forces versus a sudden elevation in intraluminal pressure resulting from abrupt compression of the carotid artery during sudden neck flexion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/3,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14</a>]. Penetrating trauma and iatrogenic injuries may also result in high-flow CCFs. Iatrogenic fistulas have been reported after carotid endarterectomy surgery, endovascular procedures, transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, and sinus surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>].</p><p>Most CCFs that are not associated with trauma are idiopathic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Some high-flow CCFs may arise from rupture of a preexisting cavernous sinus aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/1,5,6,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6,20-22</a>]. In one series of 51 carotid sinus aneurysms, 10 (24 percent) presented with a CCF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. By contrast, in another study of 174 patients with cavernous sinus aneurysms, only 13 (7.5 percent) presented with CCF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Eighty-eight patients with unruptured, untreated aneurysms were subsequently followed for a mean of 4.5 years; none of these aneurysms were associated with rupture or CCF formation over this time period. </p><p>Genetic conditions associated with spontaneous direct CCFs include fibromuscular dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/19,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,23,24</a>], Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>], and pseudoxanthoma elasticum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. It is hypothesized that these patients have a defect in the arterial wall that ruptures from relatively minor trauma such as coughing or Valsalva. </p><p>Dural CCFs (Barrow type B-D) may arise from preexisting microscopic communications between dural arteries and venous sinuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/14,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,31</a>]. Factors that induce venous thrombosis or increase venous pressure are thought to increase the number and size of these microscopic shunt vessels. A hormonal effect was postulated but not proven in a few reported cases of CCF occurring during pregnancy and the postpartum period; however, a relative hypercoagulable state during this period may also have contributed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. Indirect CCFs may also follow head trauma, but this is less common than with direct, high-flow CCF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/13,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,35</a>]. Hypertension may be another risk factor for spontaneous CCF formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/1,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2073844\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2073851\"><span class=\"h2\">High-flow carotid-cavernous fistulas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The characteristic clinical presentation of patients with high-flow direct CCFs results from the arterialization of orbital veins. The onset of symptoms is usually abrupt and may progress rapidly. Common symptoms and signs on presentation include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/5-7,13,16,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7,13,16,36</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subjective bruit (80 percent), bruits may also be auscultated over the globe</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blurred vision (25 to 59 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache (53 to 75 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diplopia (50 to 85 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ocular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> orbital pain (35 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proptosis (72 to 87 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemosis and conjunctival injection (55 to 89 percent)</p><p/><p>With respect to ophthalmoplegia, cranial nerve VI is involved in 50 to 85 percent of cases, cranial nerve III is involved in 67 percent of cases, and cranial nerve IV is involved in 49 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/5,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16</a>]. Facial sensory loss may also result from involvement of cranial nerve V. Cranial neuropathies can be difficult to distinguish from deficits acquired from the initial trauma.</p><p>Funduscopic examination can reveal nonspecific findings of venous stasis retinopathy with dilated retinal veins and intraretinal hemorrhages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F57345\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57345 \">picture 1</a>). These along with proptosis, chemosis, and eyelid swelling can result from vascular congestion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59900\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59900 \">picture 2</a>). If severe, this can lead to exposure keratopathy and sight-threatening corneal ulceration. Arterialization of conjunctival and episcleral vessels results from blood forced into the venous drainage of the orbit. This can result in elevated episcleral venous pressure, secondary glaucoma, and, rarely, catastrophic central retinal artery occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>When CCF drains into cortical veins, spontaneous rupture can result in intracerebral or subarachnoid bleed in 5 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/6,7,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,14</a>]. Life-threatening epistaxis complicates a minority of direct CCFs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4625672\"><span class=\"h2\">Low-flow carotid-cavernous fistulas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dural or indirect CCFs (Barrow type B-D) are seen most often in woman over the age of 50, and have a less fulminant presentation than do the high-flow CCFs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There is often no objective or subjective bruit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/8,9,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,39</a>]. Involvement of the fifth and seventh cranial nerves is also uncommon with these lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Dural CCFs can produce specific patterns of symptoms based on the rate of flow and the pattern(s) of venous drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior-draining dural CCFs are the most common and usually present with ocular and orbital symptoms including chemosis, conjunctival injection, and proptosis due to congestion of the superior ophthalmic vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Affected individuals are often treated prior to definitive diagnosis with antibiotics or topical steroids for a &quot;red eye.&quot; Arterialization of conjunctival vessels has a characteristic corkscrew appearance with an acute angulation near the limbus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F80414\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80414 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. There may be significant pain as well. Abducens (cranial nerve VI) palsy is the most common cause of diplopia in these patients. Loss of vision can affect one-third of patients in this category and may result from increased intraocular pressure secondary to orbital venous congestion and glaucoma, venous retinopathy, and ischemic optic neuropathy. Neurologic morbidity is relatively uncommon in this group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with dural CCFs that drain posteriorly into the inferior or superior petrosal sinus, orbital symptoms (proptosis, chemosis, lid edema) are often absent; these patients instead present with a &quot;white-eyed&quot; painful diplopia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/8,42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,42-45</a>]. The oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) is most commonly involved, with or without pupillary involvement. Sixth and fourth nerve palsies are also frequently seen. Concomitant drainage into cortical veins is more common when the dominant drainage is into the superior petrosal sinus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/9,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with drainage into cortical veins (eg, sylvian vein, basal vein of Rosenthal) are at risk for venous infarction and intracranial hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/8,39,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,39,47,48</a>]. Patients with cortical drainage may have neurologic symptoms, even in the absence of frank infarction or hemorrhage, possibly related to venous congestion or ischemia from shunting of blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Approximately one-third of patients with dural CCFs have evidence of cortical venous drainage on angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/10,12,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12,49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral orbital venous drainage of a CCF may lead to bilateral or even contralateral symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/9,10,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,47</a>]. Patients with bilateral orbital venous drainage with a unilateral dural CCF are more likely to also have cortical venous drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Alternatively, some patients present with bilateral dural CCFs. In one case series of 85 patients, 25 presented with bilateral symptoms, 10 of whom had documentation of bilateral fistulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. An additional three patients had bilateral fistulas but with symptoms only on one side.</p><p/><p>The pattern of venous drainage can change due to the development of thrombosis; as an example, a posteriorly draining CCF may evolve into one that drains mostly anteriorly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Symptoms may also wax and wane as the result of spontaneous thrombosis and subsequent clot dissolution.</p><p>Vision loss is more problematic in the setting of anterior drainage and prominent orbital signs and can affect one-third of patients in this category [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/9,10,44,50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,44,50-53</a>].

These include a primary intracranial tumor, lymphoma or other local or distant metastatic tumors, aneurysm, carotid dissection, cavernous sinus thrombosis, infection, Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, orbital pseudotumor, vasculitis, and sarcoidosis. Of these conditions, tumors are the most common.</p><p>In addition to these structural compressive lesions, painful ophthalmoplegia can also be caused by ophthalmoplegic migraine, giant cell arteritis, or a diabetic cranial nerve palsy. Patients with pain, proptosis, chemosis, and injection may be suspected of having conjunctivitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> orbital cellulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. When patients present with painful oculomotor (cranial nerve III) palsy, a posterior communicating artery aneurysm will appropriately be considered.</p><p>Many of these disorders are discussed in more detail separately.

CCFs can be seen on computed tomography (CT), CT angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and orbital or transcranial ultrasound. These studies are often ordered as an initial study to exclude other considered diagnoses. (See <a href=\"#H4626550\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT findings in CCF may include proptosis, expansion of the cavernous sinus and superior ophthalmic vein, enlargement of extraocular muscles, as well as any associated skull fractures. Posterior-draining dural CCFs are less likely to have associated abnormalities on CT or MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. CTA (using contrast enhancement) appears to be reliable in detecting CCF, and in one study had better sensitivity than MRA at detecting CCFs in the proximal portion of the cavernous sinus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI also shows proptosis, expansion of the cavernous sinus and superior ophthalmic vein, and enlargement of extraocular muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78809\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78809 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/13,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,56</a>]. MRI may show an abnormal cavernous sinus flow void, a finding specific to CCF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. MRI is less sensitive than CT for skull fracture. Use of three-dimensional (3D) time-of-flight MRA can be helpful in the diagnosis of CCF, revealing the shunt with 83 percent sensitivity and 100 percent specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. MRA using a less common technique, elliptical centric time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics (EC-TRICKS), has the advantage of providing both spatial and temporal resolution of the arterial and venous circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography typically reveals increased blood flow velocity and decreased pulsatility index in the carotid siphon in patients with CCF. Abnormalities are observed in both high- and low-flow CCFs, although the findings are less dramatically abnormal in the latter. In general, TCD does not provide details regarding size or venous drainage, although use of color-coding may help distinguish direct from indirect CCF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/13,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,60</a>].

The goal is to close the fistula while preserving flow within the ICA. Detachable balloons, platinum coils, polyvinyl alcohol particulates, and liquid adhesives have been used to close the fistula using superselective microcatheters placed in the fistula. Treatment may require more than one procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/7,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,64</a>]. Stenting, alone or with coil placement, has also been employed successfully in some direct CCFs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/7,74-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,74-78</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In some patients, a decision may be made to occlude the ICA itself with either balloon or coils.

Temporary balloon occlusion of the ICA should be performed beforehand to assess the risk of this approach (see <a href=\"#H2073879\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and imaging findings'</a> above). However, even patients who appear to tolerate temporary balloon occlusion of the ICA have a substantial risk of cerebral infarction when the ICA is occluded.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A transarterial embolization approach is more difficult in indirect CCFs because arterial feeders are small, tortuous, and often multiple [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. However, it may be used for indirect CCF, sometimes in combination with transvenous embolization in CCFs with external carotid artery supply (Barrow type C or D). polyvinyl alcohol particles or liquid adhesive agents are typically used in this setting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Complications of transarterial embolization include migration of embolic material into the distal intracranial circulation, causing cerebral ischemia or infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/5,14,49,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14,49,79</a>].

Radiosurgery produces long-term obliteration of dural CCFs in 75 to 100 percent of patients; however, there is a significant latency of several months, even a few years, to the full therapeutic effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-cavernous-fistulas/abstract/65,90-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,90-92</a>].
