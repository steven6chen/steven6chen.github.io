The heart is divided into 4 sections, called &quot;chambers.&quot; People with a VSD have a hole between the 2 lower chambers, called the &quot;ventricles&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83029\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83029 \">figure 1</a>). VSD changes the way blood flows through the heart. If the VSD is large, this can cause serious health problems.</p><p>VSD is a common heart problem. A person who has VSD was born with it. He or she might only have VSD, or also have other heart problems.</p><p>A VSD causes a heart murmur. This is an extra sound doctors or nurses hear when they listen to the heart with a stethoscope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12130544\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of ventricular septal defect?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A baby or child who has a small VSD might not have any symptoms. If the VSD is medium or large, it can cause symptoms by the time a baby is 2 to 8 weeks old. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heartbeat that seems faster than usual </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing that is fast, noisy, or both</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not gaining weight or growing as quickly as other babies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acting hungry, but having trouble eating &ndash; Babies with VSD can get tired and sweaty when they try to eat.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pale skin</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12130559\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a baby has VSD, a doctor or nurse might find it soon after birth. But this does not always happen. See the doctor or nurse if your baby has any of the symptoms of VSD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12130574\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If the doctor or nurse thinks your child might have a VSD, he or she will probably order tests. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in the heart. It might show a pattern of abnormal electrical activity that is common in people who have VSD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray &ndash; A chest X-ray can be normal if your child has a small VSD. It can show changes to the heart if there is a medium or large VSD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An echocardiogram &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create a picture of the heart as it beats. It can help the doctor make sure VSD is the cause of symptoms. It can also show how big the VSD is and exactly where it is in the heart.</p><p/><p>These tests can also show if a child has other heart problems and what they are.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12130591\"><span class=\"h1\">How is ventricular septal defect treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is different for each person. It depends on how big the VSD is and if it causes symptoms.</p><p>Small VSDs often close on their own without causing symptoms. Or they might stay open, but never cause health problems.</p><p>People who have a small VSD might not need any specific treatment unless the VSD causes problems. They can have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular checkups &ndash; If your baby has a small VSD, he or she might only need regular checkups. Some people have a small VSD for life that does not cause symptoms. They need regular checkups to make sure the heart stays healthy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests to check the heart &ndash; These tests can also show doctors if the heart is staying healthy.</p><p/><p>Medium or large VSDs usually cause symptoms. People with this type of VSD need regular checkups to make sure the heart is healthy and to look for any changes. They might also need treatment.</p><p>Treatments for medium or large VSDs can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to help the heart</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Making sure a child gets good nutrition &ndash; A baby with a medium or large VSD might need formula that has extra nutrition. This can help the baby gain weight and grow normally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment to close the VSD &ndash; If a medium or large VSD does not close or get smaller by the time a baby is 6 to 12 months old, doctors can close it with:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Surgery to patch the hole &ndash; This is the most common treatment to close a VSD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A procedure called &quot;transcatheter closure&quot; &ndash; In this treatment, a doctor places a thin tube into a blood vessel in an arm or leg. Then, he or she moves the tube through the blood vessel to the heart. When the tube gets to the hole in the heart, the doctor uses the tube to put in a small device that closes the hole.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12130606\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-murmurs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart murmurs (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
