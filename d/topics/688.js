Mild withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, agitation, restlessness, insomnia, tremor, diaphoresis, palpitations, headache, and alcohol craving, and often loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. Symptoms of more severe withdrawal can additionally include hallucinations as well as seizures or delirium tremens; the latter two can be life-threatening.</p><p>Medically supervised alcohol withdrawal is indicated for patients with or at risk of withdrawal symptoms. For patients with mild symptoms and no history of seizures or delirium tremens, supervised withdrawal can be managed safely and effectively in the ambulatory setting. Patients with more severe symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> at risk of delirium tremens, seizures, or hallucinations require closer monitoring and intervention, typically in an inpatient setting. </p><p>This topic reviews ambulatory management of mild alcohol withdrawal.

Supervised withdrawal is indicated for patients with or at risk for alcohol withdrawal symptoms. </p><p>Studies have estimated that half of patients with DSM-IV alcohol dependence (approximately equivalent to moderate to severe alcohol use disorder in DSM-5) experience withdrawal symptoms after they stop or sharply reduce their drinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-management-of-alcohol-withdrawal/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]; in our clinical experience, a much smaller proportion of patients with any alcohol use disorder experience withdrawal. </p><p>Withdrawal symptoms are usually present within 6 to 24 hours of cessation of drinking and often develop while the patient still has a significant blood alcohol concentration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75499\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75499 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-management-of-alcohol-withdrawal/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. If withdrawal does not progress, these symptoms generally resolve within 24 to 48 hours, often sooner. If 24 hours pass since the last drink without the development of symptoms in someone not at risk for major withdrawal, no medication is indicated as symptoms are unlikely to develop. Mild symptoms in patients not at risk for seizures can be managed without medication unless the symptoms worsen, at which point medication can be administered. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3294236595\"><span class=\"h2\">Ambulatory criteria</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Principal indications</strong> for medically supervised alcohol withdrawal in an <strong>ambulatory setting</strong> are:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A patient with mild symptoms of alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar less than 15), or asymptomatic patient with a history of symptoms with past attempts to reduce their drinking.

Benzodiazepines and gabapentin are similarly efficacious for alcohol withdrawal, and gabapentin has lesser side effects; however, benzodiazepines have the most extensive history of clinical trials showing efficacy and are widely used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-management-of-alcohol-withdrawal/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Dosing of benzodiazepines is described below and in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65653\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65653 \">table 2</a>).

Gabapentin has been shown in clinical trials to be as effective as benzodiazepines in reducing or preventing withdrawal symptoms other than seizures and delirium tremens in the ambulatory setting (see <a href=\"#H1506554729\" class=\"local\">'Gabapentin'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clinical trial randomly assigned 100 outpatients with DSM-IV alcohol dependence and CIWA-Ar &gt;9 to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> (starting at 900 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> (starting at 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> for a fixed-dose taper over four days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-management-of-alcohol-withdrawal/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients had access to additional symptom-triggered doses of the assigned medication. Withdrawal-symptom severity decreased in all groups, with a greater reduction in the higher-dose gabapentin group that was statistically but not clinically significant. Gabapentin was well tolerated, and led to less craving, anxiety, and sedation compared with lorazepam. Patients in the high dose gabapentin group had lower odds of drinking alcohol both during treatment and in the week posttreatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A smaller trial randomly assigned 26 alcohol dependent outpatients with CIWA-Ar scores &gt;5 to receive a six-day taper of either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> (starting at 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlordiazepoxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlordiazepoxide</a> (starting at 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>.

At the end of the study period, gabapentin-treated patients reported significantly less sedation and a trend towards reduced cravings compared with the chlordiazepoxide group.</p><p/><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gabapentin</a> has been shown to be less sedating than benzodiazepines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-management-of-alcohol-withdrawal/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>] and, in our clinical experience, is associated with less cognitive and psychomotor impairment. (See <a href=\"#H1506554729\" class=\"local\">'Gabapentin'</a> below.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gabapentin</a> has not been shown to reduce the likelihood of delirium tremens or seizures; however, there are no data demonstrating that benzodiazepines reduce rates of seizures during ambulatory supervised withdrawal. In contrast, the benefits of benzodiazepines in preventing seizures during inpatient alcohol withdrawal is well established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Seizures and delirium tremens are relatively rare events in patients appropriately screened to undergo supervised withdrawal in the ambulatory setting. As an example, an observational study described supervised withdrawal of 1024 alcohol dependent patients that utilized only behavioral approaches (ie, no psychoactive medication). Only 12 patients (1.2 percent) experienced seizures; a single patient (0.1 percent) developed delirium tremens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-management-of-alcohol-withdrawal/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>There are no data directly comparing rates of misuse between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> and benzodiazepines. Based on the limited data available and our clinical experience, gabapentin is believed to be less addictive and subject to misuse by patients with alcohol use disorder compared with benzodiazepines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-management-of-alcohol-withdrawal/abstract/10-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-16</a>]. Potential for misuse and sedation are generally minor considerations during the relatively short period of supervised withdrawal. (See <a href=\"#H597680482\" class=\"local\">'Benzodiazepines'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1506554729\" class=\"local\">'Gabapentin'</a> below.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gabapentin</a> is preferred to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, due to the latter&rsquo;s higher rates of side effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, and nausea in our clinical experience. (See <a href=\"#H111492754\" class=\"local\">'Carbamazepine'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1652474411\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of treatment for alcohol withdrawal in the ambulatory setting can range from one or two days to as long as seven days, depending on the severity of the withdrawal symptoms. </p><p>Clinicians should be in contact with patients daily. Assessment by phone on alternating days can be an adequate alternative to daily face-to-face visits for some patients with minor withdrawal. Higher-risk patients should be seen in person daily. Because individuals who drink heavy amounts daily are at risk of progressing to delirium tremens for up to five days following their last drink [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-management-of-alcohol-withdrawal/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], they are generally seen daily during that period, though if there is no evidence of symptoms worsening, delirium tremens are very unlikely. If daily ambulatory surveillance is unavailable or impractical, alternatives include referral to the emergency department or a partial hospital program.</p><p>At each visit, vital signs are obtained. The change in intensity of withdrawal symptoms is assessed by physical examination and reassessment with the CIWA-Ar (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-ciwa-ar-clinical-institute-withdrawal-assessment-for-alcohol-scale\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>), and is used to guide dosing. Fixed and symptom-triggered dosing schedules are reviewed later in the topic. To minimize opportunities for misuse or diversion, a one-day supply of medication can be prescribed daily. (See <a href=\"#H597680482\" class=\"local\">'Benzodiazepines'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1506554729\" class=\"local\">'Gabapentin'</a> below.)</p><p>A family member or close contact recruited to stay with the patient during the supervised withdrawal period is asked to monitor the patient frequently for increasing withdrawal symptoms and respiratory depression.

Occurrence of one or more of these events should prompt a transition to a higher level of care with either hospitalization or referral to an addiction specialist or treatment center. &#160;</p><p>Another potential complication is misuse of treatment medication during or after completion of medically supervised withdrawal. If misuse is suspected, a higher level of care may be necessary.

The trial randomly assigned 164 mild to moderately dependent male veterans of low socioeconomic status to receive either outpatient or inpatient supervised withdrawal followed by initiation of rehabilitative treatment. The mean duration of treatment was shorter for outpatients compared with inpatients (6.5 versus 9.2 days). Both groups showed improved drinking related outcomes. More inpatients compared with outpatients completed treatment (95 versus 72 percent); however, there were no differences between groups in alcohol-related or medical problems at six-month follow-up. There were no serious medical complications in either group.
