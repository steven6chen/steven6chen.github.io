Effective interventions include a number of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies that are often provided in combination. Patients with fibromyalgia generally respond best to a multidisciplinary, individualized treatment program that incorporates the primary treating clinician and other healthcare providers, including physical medicine, rehabilitation, and mental health specialists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The treatment of fibromyalgia in adults who are not responsive to initial therapies will be reviewed here. The initial treatment and prognosis of fibromyalgia in adults; the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia; and fibromyalgia in children and adolescents are discussed separately.

The specific intervention depends upon symptoms, patient preferences regarding the types of therapies, available resources, and expertise. These interventions are not mutually exclusive and may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combinations of drugs (see <a href=\"#H22299532\" class=\"local\">'Combination drug therapy'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Referral for a supervised physical medicine and rehabilitation evaluation and treatment program (see <a href=\"#H351009661\" class=\"local\">'Exercise and physical therapy'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Referral for psychological interventions for pain management, including cognitive behavioral therapy and other interventions (see <a href=\"#H22299539\" class=\"local\">'Psychological therapies'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consultation with one or more specialists, depending upon the specific expertise needed, such as a rheumatologist, physiatrist, psychiatrist, psychologist, sleep specialist, or pain management specialist (see <a href=\"#H351008147\" class=\"local\">'Consultation and referral'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment and care in a specialized multidisciplinary program, particularly for patients with disease refractory to other interventions or on chronic opioids (see <a href=\"#H281624293\" class=\"local\">'Multidisciplinary treatment programs'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other treatments, including medications for which there is more limited evidence, and complementary and alternative measures, including &quot;mind-body&quot; therapies such as tai chi and yoga (see <a href=\"#H22300507\" class=\"local\">'Analgesic and antiinflammatory drugs'</a> below and <a href=\"#H22300536\" class=\"local\">'Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors'</a> below and <a href=\"#H22300584\" class=\"local\">'Complementary and alternative therapies'</a> below)</p><p/><p>Nonpharmacologic interventions are important in the initial management of fibromyalgia; these and other nonpharmacologic interventions are also beneficial to patients with disease that does not respond to initial therapies. Some patients respond sufficiently well without drug therapy to avoid the need for medications; this is more common among those presenting in the primary care setting. The 2017 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) revised treatment recommendations for fibromyalgia suggest that initial therapy should consist of patient education and nonpharmacologic management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

These recommendations are based largely upon clinical experience, as there is relatively little data regarding the relative benefits or adverse effects of drug combinations. The evidence for efficacy of each of the individual drugs is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;, section on 'Medications'</a>.)</p><p>In clinical practice, we combine drugs of different classes to take advantage of multiple mechanisms of action for reducing pain and to target different symptoms. A variety of combinations may be effective, and selection of specific agents depends upon patient tolerance, drug availability, cost to the patient, and comorbidities that may be present, such as psychiatric illness. Examples of combinations we have used are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There has been evidence for combining a low dose of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>) or an SNRI in the morning with a low dose of tricyclic antidepressant (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>) in the evening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In that trial, there was significantly greater improvement in pain with the combination of agents compared with fluoxetine or amitriptyline alone or with placebo (visual analogue pain scale score, with maximum of 100, of 43 versus 58 and of 64 versus 82). (See <a href=\"#H22300536\" class=\"local\">'Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;, section on 'Tricyclic antidepressants as initial drug therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A low dose of a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milnacipran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milnacipran</a>) in the morning with a low dose of an anticonvulsant (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>) in the evening. This combination has thus far been evaluated in an open-label randomized trial involving 364 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In this trial, fibromyalgia patients with an inadequate response to treatment with pregabalin (300 or 450 mg daily) experienced significantly greater pain reduction and global improvement with the addition of an SNRI, milnacipran (100 mg daily), compared with patients continuing pregabalin alone (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults#H1979157\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;, section on 'Duloxetine'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults#H352171902\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;, section on 'Pregabalin'</a>).

The combination resulted in greater improvement in a number of clinical outcomes, including pain, function, and sleep. Another trial, involving 143 patients with fibromyalgia, compared the combination of the antiviral agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famciclovir</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> with placebo, noting greater improvement in scores with the combination for pain, function, and fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, the medication adherence for the combinations of pregabalin with either duloxetine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milnacipran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milnacipran</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> was better than monotherapy with each of those four medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, total health care costs were higher with the combination therapy.</p><p/><p>Clinicians with insufficient experience in the use of these medications or drug combinations may wish to consult with an expert in the pharmacologic treatment of fibromyalgia, such as a rheumatologist. In patients who also have a comorbid psychiatric illness, we advise consultation with a psychiatrist for assistance in medication management and coordination of care. (See <a href=\"#H351008147\" class=\"local\">'Consultation and referral'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients without an adequate response to these medications or with a temporary need for additional treatment during an exacerbation of pain symptoms, other agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a>, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are adjunctive or alternative therapies that may be helpful. Other antidepressants may also be used in some patients as alternative agents; however, there is less evidence for their benefit than the tricyclics, SNRIs, SSRIs, or anticonvulsants cited above. (See <a href=\"#H22300507\" class=\"local\">'Analgesic and antiinflammatory drugs'</a> below and <a href=\"#H22300536\" class=\"local\">'Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors'</a> below and <a href=\"#H22300521\" class=\"local\">'Antiinflammatory medications'</a> below.)</p><p>Other medications that have been used in patients with fibromyalgia include opioid analgesics other than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a>, muscle relaxants, and stimulants, but there is insufficient evidence for their efficacy or safety in the treatment of fibromyalgia.

In some countries, treatment with balneotherapy, such as immersion in thermal or mineral water (eg, spa treatment), is used for treating patients with fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>A 2017 meta-analysis found that exercise training improved anxiety in patients with fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Resistance training was found to reduce pain and fatigue and to improve strength, leptin, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels in lean women with fibromyalgia but not in those who were overweight or obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Additional forms of exercise that have shown some benefit in fibromyalgia but which are not primarily directed at developing aerobic fitness include &quot;mind-body&quot; interventions such as tai chi and yoga.

Psychological interventions should be integrated with multidisciplinary treatment that also includes pharmacologic therapy, education, and exercise. (See <a href=\"#H351008147\" class=\"local\">'Consultation and referral'</a> below and <a href=\"#H281624293\" class=\"local\">'Multidisciplinary treatment programs'</a> below.)</p><p>A role for psychological therapies, particularly CBT, in the treatment of fibromyalgia is well-supported by evidence from meta-analyses, individual trials, and observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. CBT is also established as a therapy for insomnia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of insomnia in adults&quot;, section on 'Cognitive behavioral therapy'</a>). In addition to CBT, measures that are helpful include mindfulness-based treatments, relaxation, biofeedback, behavioral treatments, and educational interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Additionally, education, focusing on self-management, combined with exercise enhances the benefits of exercise in fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

An internet-delivered cognitive behavioral pain management course given to 30 fibromyalgia patients significantly improved symptoms compared with 30 waitlisted controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Pain, depression, and patient satisfaction improved during the five-lesson course delivered over eight weeks. A long-term economic evaluation of cognitive behavioral therapy for functional somatic syndromes, including fibromyalgia, found significant short- and long-term benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. There were 7184 euros cost savings during the third year after treatment. Cognitive behavioral therapy, compared with patient education, reduced catastrophizing in fibromyalgia patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This correlated with brain primary somatosensory cortex (S1)-insula, suggesting that cognitive behavioral therapy may normalize pain-related hyperreactivity in fibromyalgia.</p><p>In patients with significant cognitive dysfunction despite other therapies, referral to an expert in cognitive impairment, such as a neurologist, may be of benefit to determine whether other causes for cognitive dysfunction are present and if further diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are required. Some patients may also benefit from consultation with a clinical psychologist for neuropsychological (psychometric) testing.

Noncompliance, whether due to forgetfulness, due to carelessness, or as an exercise of patient autonomy, may contribute to a lack of effectiveness of medications prescribed for patients with fibromyalgia. Adherence to advice by patients with fibromyalgia cared for by 10 rheumatologists was assessed in a study of 127 women with fibromyalgia recruited from both tertiary care hospitals and the community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Overall, 47 percent of the women reported noncompliance with medications. The degree of discordance between a clinician&rsquo;s and patient&rsquo;s assessments of communication during, as well as patient satisfaction at the conclusion of, a clinician-patient encounter was a significant determinant of overall compliance.</p><p>A large study using insurance claims data from the United States found that only 31 percent of fibromyalgia patients initiated treatment with one of the medications listed in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. These medications included <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milnacipran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milnacipran</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclobenzaprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclobenzaprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>. Many of these subjects did not receive the recommended dose, and adherence was suboptimal for each of the ACR recommended medications. Approximately 50 percent of patients received a second analgesic within one year.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112654470\"><span class=\"h2\">Treating peripheral pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We treat other sources of pain, such as arthritis or regional pain syndromes, which may also contribute to the patient&rsquo;s symptoms. Patients with nociceptive pain may require other agents, such as analgesics or antiinflammatory or immunosuppressive drugs, depending upon the condition (eg, osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis) causing such pain.</p><p>Treating peripheral pain generators, such as myofascial trigger points, may also improve symptoms of fibromyalgia. The local and referred pain pattern induced from active myofascial trigger points bilaterally in the upper trapezius muscle was similar to the ongoing pain pattern in the neck and shoulder region in fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Such treatment can be facilitated by multidisciplinary treatment programs. These may be developed in physical medicine and rehabilitation centers by physiatrists or in chronic pain units. Rheumatologists or others may also provide this care, particularly if they work closely with physiatrists, physical therapists, and mental health professionals. The advantage of such a program is to provide a structured, multimodality treatment program under one roof and in a relatively brief time frame. This type of program may be especially helpful in patients who are resistant to drug therapy and in those patients with the most complicated psychosocial issues, including disability proceedings.</p><p>Significant benefits of multicomponent treatment were documented in a 2009 meta-analysis involving 1119 patients with fibromyalgia in nine randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. For inclusion in the meta-analysis, multicomponent treatment needed to include at least one educational or other psychological therapy and at least one exercise therapy; the controls for comparison with the multicomponent treatment also varied but were required to be a control receiving no treatment, receiving treatment as usual, or receiving another well-defined treatment with a lower intensity than the multicomponent intervention. There was evidence of significant reductions in pain, fatigue, depressive symptoms, and limitations to health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and patients had improved self-efficacy for pain (belief in one&rsquo;s ability to accomplish a task or cope with pain) at the end of the treatment program but not after longer term follow-up (median of seven months). Physical fitness was improved both after treatment and after follow-up.</p><p>As an example, in one randomized trial that examined this approach, a six-week interdisciplinary treatment combining a coordinated psychological, medical, educational, and physiotherapeutic component demonstrated significant improvements, which persisted for 6 to 12 months, in quality of life, physical function, and pain compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs may also aid in reducing use of opioids and other analgesics in patients taking these medications. As an example, an uncontrolled study admitted 159 fibromyalgia patients to a multidisciplinary pain rehabilitation program based upon cognitive behavioral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Physical and emotional function improved, and the use of analgesics, including opioids, was reduced.</p><p>Three further randomized trials of interdisciplinary management of fibromyalgia patients have also demonstrated significant improvement in multiple outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>].</p><p>A 2013 network meta-analysis that indirectly compared a variety of both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for fibromyalgia noted that evidence of clinical effectiveness of these treatments is limited and that additional, adequately sized, high-quality, randomized trials are needed. Based upon the available evidence, the authors hypothesized that combinations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a> or SNRIs with multidisciplinary therapies, exercise, or cognitive behavioral therapy hold promise and should be evaluated in adequately sized, high-quality, randomized trials to provide better data regarding their potential benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Some of these programs have been web-based, utilizing telemonitoring and improving cost-utility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Such centers are typically accessed through consultation with other providers with expertise in the care of patients with fibromyalgia. We generally avoid referral to pain clinics that lack such interest and expertise, as many of the approaches typically employed in latter types of centers include strategies that have not proven effective in the chronic management of fibromyalgia, such as interventional procedures and chronic opioid use.</p><p>In a study of more than two million subjects in the Veterans Health Administration system with various forms of chronic pain approximately 6 percent were attending pain clinics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. A diagnosis of fibromyalgia was the strongest independent correlate of pain clinic attendance. Veterans attending pain clinics had more comorbid psychiatric disorders and were more often on opioids.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acupuncture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acupuncture&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For example, in one report, all treatment groups experienced a substantial decrease in pain from baseline; however, the mean difference in pain relief between the traditional acupuncture group and all the sham groups was insignificant (0.5 cm on a 10 cm scale, 95% CI -0.3 to 1.2 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>A 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis of acupuncture therapy, involving 395 patients with fibromyalgia in nine randomized trials, showed evidence for improvement in pain and stiffness with acupuncture compared with no treatment and with standard therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. However, analysis of six of the trials, involving 286 patients, showed no significant differences in most measures in comparison with sham acupuncture, including pain, fatigue, sleep, or global well-being, although there was less stiffness at one month. Benefit was more likely in trials of electroacupuncture than in those evaluating manual acupuncture (not involving electrostimulation). A subgroup analysis of two trials involving a total of 104 patients found greater benefit in a variety of measures using electroacupuncture compared with sham acupuncture; as an example, there was an absolute improvement in global well-being compared with sham acupuncture of 11 percent (95% CI, 4-17 percent). However, the benefits lasted only one month and were not seen at six months of follow-up. A subsequent randomized trial also found benefit from acupuncture compared with sham acupuncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5085033\"><span class=\"h2\">Injection therapies and other physical measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been few studies of trigger point or tender point injections, electromyography (EMG) biofeedback, chiropractic, or massage in the treatment of fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].

The most studied has been transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In the initial report 32 patients with fibromyalgia were randomly assigned to receive sham stimulation, real tDCS with the anode centered over the primary motor cortex, or stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Direct current stimulation consisted of 2 mA for 20 minutes on five consecutive days with the anode placed on the scalp over the appropriate brain region. The change in pain was significantly greater in those who received real tDCS to the motor cortex than in the groups receiving sham or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the left prefrontal cortex, administered in a two-week randomized trial involving 20 patients with fibromyalgia, significantly reduced symptoms of pain from the level at baseline compared with sham TMS (mean reduction of 29 versus 4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Symptoms of depression also improved. Another randomized trial investigated the effects of five consecutive 20-minute sessions of 2-mA anodal tDCS directed to the M1 in 48 patients (45 females) with fibromyalgia. There was a small but significant improvement in pain under the active tDCS condition but not under the sham condition. Fibromyalgia-related daily functioning improved in the active tDCS group compared with the sham group. The small effect sizes indicated that the results were unlikely to reflect clinically important changes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A 2016 systematic review concluded that in comparison with sham stimulation, rTMS demonstrated superior effect on the quality of life of patients with fibromyalgia one&nbsp;month after starting therapy, and the authors recommended that further studies are needed to determine optimal treatment protocols and to elucidate the mechanisms involved with this effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].

In patients with continued symptoms despite initial nonpharmacologic measures and treatment with single drugs at the maximum tolerated dose, we continue the use of both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment measures, and we modify or add specific interventions depending upon the symptoms, patient preferences regarding the types of therapies, available resources, and expertise. (See <a href=\"#H281622868\" class=\"local\">'Overview of treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H351008102\" class=\"local\">'Patients not responsive to initial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest using combination drug therapy in most patients unresponsive to monotherapy, rather than switching to or adding analgesics and rather than continuing monotherapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Medication selection should be guided by the symptoms that most affect the patient. We combine drugs of different classes (eg, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor [SNRI] such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a> in the morning, with a low dose of an anticonvulsant, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>, in the evening; or a low dose of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> or an SNRI, in the morning with a low dose of tricyclic antidepressant, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>, in the evening) to take advantage of multiple mechanisms of action for reducing pain and to target different symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H22299532\" class=\"local\">'Combination drug therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who have had difficulty achieving a sufficient level of low-impact aerobic exercise, we encourage participation in a supervised physical medicine and rehabilitation program. We refer patients with continued difficulties with exercise or physical functioning to a physiatrist for further evaluation and for assistance in management. (See <a href=\"#H351009661\" class=\"local\">'Exercise and physical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients whose symptoms do not respond adequately to initial therapies, we suggest referral for psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>); the specific interventions should be individualized based upon patient preference and available resources. Other psychological measures that may be beneficial include mindfulness-based treatments, relaxation, biofeedback, behavioral treatments, and educational interventions. (See <a href=\"#H22299539\" class=\"local\">'Psychological therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment should generally be multidisciplinary and should be individualized with attention to the patient&rsquo;s particular symptoms. In patients who have not responded adequately to initial therapies, we advise consultation with specialists in rheumatology, physiatry, psychiatry, neuropsychology, or sleep medicine for further evaluation and for assistance in management, depending upon the expertise of the treating clinician and upon the patient&rsquo;s symptoms and comorbidities. Alternatively, multidisciplinary treatment and specialist consultation can be facilitated by multidisciplinary treatment programs. (See <a href=\"#H351008147\" class=\"local\">'Consultation and referral'</a> above and <a href=\"#H281624293\" class=\"local\">'Multidisciplinary treatment programs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several approaches may be tried in patients who do not respond to the more well-substantiated nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies. Most of these additional approaches are supported by more limited evidence, including analgesics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a>), antiinflammatory drugs, alternative antidepressants, and complementary and alternative therapies (eg, tai chi or yoga). (See <a href=\"#H22300507\" class=\"local\">'Analgesic and antiinflammatory drugs'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22300536\" class=\"local\">'Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22300584\" class=\"local\">'Complementary and alternative therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no evidence that opioids are effective in the treatment of fibromyalgia, and studies have suggested possible adverse effects. In patients who have not responded to multidisciplinary individualized nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapy, we favor the use of pain clinics that utilize a multidisciplinary approach to fibromyalgia therapy rather than pain clinics that lack such interest and expertise.
