The evaluation is designed to characterize the underlying rheumatic disease, to identify the type and severity of ILD, and to exclude other explanations for the patient's symptoms and signs (eg, infection, drug-induced lung toxicity, respiratory muscle weakness, myocardial dysfunction). The evaluation typically includes laboratory testing, high resolution computed tomography, pulmonary function testing, and sometimes bronchoalveolar lavage. A minority of patients may need a lung biopsy.

For patients who do not have a confirmed diagnosis of DM or PM, we usually obtain serum muscle enzymes (eg, creatine kinase and aldolase), an antinuclear antibody (ANA) test, and an anti-Jo-1 antibody (anti-histidyl-transfer [t] RNA synthetase). If the anti-Jo-1 antibody is negative, we obtain a panel of the other myositis-specific autoantibodies, such as those directed against other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (eg, anti-PL-7 [anti-threonyl-tRNA synthetase], anti-PL-12 [anti-alanyl-tRNA synthetase]). Of note, the ANA can be negative in the presence of anti-synthetase autoantibodies since aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes are in the cell cytoplasm.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several histologic patterns of ILD are associated with DM and PM: nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), organizing pneumonia (OP, also known as bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia [BOOP]), and acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP, also known as diffuse alveolar damage [DAD]). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with DM or PM-associated ILD typically complain of dyspnea and a nonproductive cough, although some patients are asymptomatic, and ILD is suspected because of an abnormal lung exam or an abnormal chest radiograph. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain subtypes of PM and DM warrant particular attention as they are more likely to manifest ILD or to have more severe disease. These subtypes include the antisynthetase syndrome (associated with &quot;mechanics hands&quot;), clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (CADM), which is also associated with distinct cutaneous findings (eg, palmar papules and ulcerating lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F108220\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108220 \">picture 2</a>)), and the overlap syndromes associated with features of other systemic rheumatic diseases in addition to DM or PM. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial laboratory testing typically includes a complete blood count and differential, hepatic and renal function tests, and a brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal-proBNP. If the diagnosis of DM or PM has not been confirmed, we usually obtain serum muscle enzymes (eg, creatine kinase and aldolase), an antinuclear antibody test, and an anti-Jo-1 antibody. Additional testing (eg, other antisynthetase antibodies, anti-antimelanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 [MDA-5] antibodies, testing for an overlap syndrome) is based on the clinical examination and results of the initial tests. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is the preferred imaging test due to its greater sensitivity and ability to characterize the extent and pattern of interstitial changes. Radiographic patterns reflect the underlying pathology and include ground glass opacification, peripheral or basal consolidation, septal thickening, honeycombing, and irregular linear opacities, with patchy ground glass opacities and septal thickening being most common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83491\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83491 \">image 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of ILD in patients with known DM and PM can usually be established based on the clinical presentation, chest imaging studies (ie, HRCT), and pulmonary function tests. Lung biopsy is usually not necessary. However, when the clinical course or imaging studies are atypical (eg, associated with fever, rapidly progressive, developing during immunosuppressive therapy), bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is typically performed to exclude infection or drug toxicity. If the diagnosis remains in doubt, a lung biopsy may be indicated. (See <a href=\"#H1761582578\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of ILD in patients with DM or PM'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In rare patients, ILD may be the initial manifestation of DM or PM. In these patients, the diagnosis of underlying DM or PM is based on the presence of clinical findings such as cutaneous manifestations (eg, Gottron papules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F63383\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63383 \">picture 3</a>), &quot;mechanic's hands&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F56057\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56057 \">picture 1</a>)), symmetric proximal muscle weakness, nail bed capillary microscopic changes, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laboratory testing. Muscle biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H1761582552\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of DM or PM in patients with ILD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of ILD in patients with DM or PM includes heart failure, infection, recurrent aspiration, drug-induced pneumonitis (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>), and, rarely, alveolar hemorrhage. Any drug suspected of causing pneumonitis should be discontinued and the response to drug withdrawal assessed.
