Prior to the advent of modern medicine, severe diarrhea was often fatal and disease outbreaks spread quickly, affecting large populations. Today, despite the success of interventions such as oral and intravenous rehydration therapy, diarrheal diseases remain a substantial cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, particularly in children and the elderly. In 2015, it was estimated that worldwide 577,000 children aged &lt;5 years and 502,000 adults aged &gt;70 years died from diarrheal diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-diarrhea-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The underlying cause of diarrhea in children are numerous and vary by age and geographical location, among other factors. </p><p>Regardless of etiology, the evaluation and management of an infant or child with diarrhea requires an understanding of the physiology of fluid and electrolyte transport in the gastrointestinal tract. This topic focuses on the pathophysiology of fluid absorption and secretion in diarrhea and a classification of diarrhea relevant to diagnostic evaluations. </p><p>Detailed reviews of the diagnostic approach and management of diarrhea in children are found in the following topics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to diarrhea in children in resource-rich countries&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of chronic diarrhea in children in resource-rich countries&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-limited-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with acute diarrhea in resource-limited countries&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Persistent diarrhea in children in resource-limited countries&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1727415866\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1884368674\"><span class=\"h2\">Diarrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of diarrhea can be defined in a number of ways, either related to volume <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> consistency of stool, or frequency of bowel movements. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For practical use in the clinical setting, diarrhea is typically defined by stool frequency and consistency. A common definition is the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day, or more frequent passage than is normal for the individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-diarrhea-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In infants and children, it can be difficult to establish the presence of diarrhea based on stool frequency or consistency, as the normal range for these parameters can vary greatly by age and diet. As an example, some healthy breastfed infants pass eight or more loose stools daily. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A more objective definition of diarrhea relies on measured stool weight or volume. In hospital settings where the volume of stools can be measured, diarrhea is defined as stool volume of more than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/kg/day</span> in infants and toddlers (&lt;10 kg), or more than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/day</span> in older children or teenagers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-diarrhea-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H216785159\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute versus chronic diarrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diarrhea is generally considered acute if it lasts less than two weeks and chronic if it lasts more than two weeks. However, there remains a lack of clear consensus on the use of symptom-based <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> duration-based definitions of diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-diarrhea-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2195262007\"><span class=\"h1\">FLUID MOVEMENT IN THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1821777725\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal fluid absorption and secretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large quantities of fluid are transported bidirectionally across epithelial barriers in the gastrointestinal tract for secretion of saliva, gastric juice, bile and pancreatic fluid, and for fluid absorption in the intestine. The quantity of fluid transported in the intestine is second only to kidney, where about 180 L of fluid per day are filtered by the glomerulus and processed by various nephron segments. </p><p>In healthy adults, several liters of fluid are absorbed and secreted by the different segments of the intestine each day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113253\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113253 \">figure 1</a>). The salivary glands produce about 1.5 L of fluid per day, the stomach secretes 2.5 L of gastric juice; the liver produces 0.5 L of bile; and the pancreas produces 1.5 L of enzyme and bicarbonate-rich fluid. To balance this the small intestine absorbs 6.5 L of fluid, and the colon additionally absorbs 1.3 L of fluid against significant osmotic gradients. </p><p>The small intestine performs most of the fluid absorption (83 percent) in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, diseases that affect the small intestine often result in clinically significant diarrhea. Although the colon absorbs a much smaller volume of fluid than the small intestine, it is critical for the generation of formed feces. The intestinal contents enter the colon with a water content of about 90 percent and leave the colon as feces, with a water content of 65 to 75 percent. Therefore, significant alteration of colonic function alone can also lead to clinical diarrhea as well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H399575406\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Movement of fluid between the intestinal lumen and blood is driven by the active transport of ions (mainly Na<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>, and K<sup>+</sup>) and nutrients (mainly glucose). Fluid absorption or secretion involves the coordinated activity of membrane transporters located on the apical (lumen-facing) and basolateral (circulation-facing) epithelial membranes. The intestinal epithelium is structurally configured into long, finger-like (in 3-dimensional pathological sections) or leaf-like projections (in 2-dimensions; villi) and glandular tube-like structures (crypts). The stem cells at the base of the crypt provide various differentiated epithelial cell types, including the more numerous enterocytes that ascend and populate the villus structure. In the small bowel, each villus is supported by as many as 10 distinct crypts. In the colon, the crypts are considerably longer than in the small bowel and produce epithelium that covers a flat luminal surface devoid of villi. Functionally, both ion and fluid absorption and secretion occur in enterocytes located in both villi and crypts, although, in the small intestine, secretory processes predominate in crypts and absorptive processes in villi (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113255\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113255 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p>Intestinal fluid absorption is driven by the active transport of Na<sup>+</sup> across the epithelium, with parallel Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> or HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup> absorption ((<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113255\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113255 \">figure 2</a>), panels A and C). The electrochemical driving force for this process is provided by the basolateral Na<sup>+</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase</span> that exports intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>. In the small intestine, fluid absorption is facilitated by the Na<sup>+</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/H<sup>+</sup></span> exchanger 3 (NHE3, also known as SLC9A3), Na<sup>+</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/glucose</span> cotransporter 1 (SGLT1 [SLC5A1]), and Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup></span> exchangers (DRA [SLC26A3] and PAT1 [SLC26A6]). Electroneutral fluid absorption is carried out by the coordinated activity of NHE3 with Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup></span> exchangers (PAT1 for HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup> absorption in the jejunum, and DRA for Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> absorption in the ileum and colon). Substrate-specific transporters such as SLC5A1 facilitate co-transport of Na<sup>+</sup> across the apical membrane together with D-glucose (or D-galactose), with the electro-neutral glucose transporter SLC2A2 facilitating glucose exit across the basolateral membrane. In the colon, in addition to electroneutral Na<sup>+</sup> transport by Na<sup>+</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/H<sup>+</sup></span> exchange (proximal colon), absorption is facilitated by the epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channel (eNaC) and short-chain fatty acid transporters (sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter, or SMCT [SLC5A8]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-diarrhea-in-children/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Intestinal fluid secretion is driven by transepithelial Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> secretion through basolateral and apical Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> channels and transporters ((<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113255\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113255 \">figure 2</a>), panels B and D). Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> is transported into the cell at the basolateral membrane by a Na<sup>+</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/K<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup></span> symporter (NKCC1, also known as SLC12A2), which is driven by the Na<sup>+</sup> concentration gradient produced by the Na<sup>+</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. K<sup>+</sup> channels <span class=\"nowrap\">(KCNQ1/KNE3</span> and KCNN4) provide the electrochemical driving force for apical Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> exit across Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> channels, which are primarily the cyclic-nucleotide-activated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> channels (CaCCs). Enteric nerves and cell surface receptors such as the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) are thought to modulate intracellular signaling pathways and hence electrolyte absorption and secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-diarrhea-in-children/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H663290985\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiology of fluid transport in diarrheal disease</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1617940192\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Water movement in the intestine occurs by osmosis across the semipermeable barrier formed by the lining epithelial cells, similar to other fluid-transporting surfaces in the body. Diarrhea occurs when excessive amounts of fluid remain within the lumen of the intestine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113254\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113254 \">figure 3</a>). This can occur because of increased secretion into the intestinal lumen, or reduced absorption of water from the lumen to the body. In either case there is an increased concentration of osmotically active particles (nutrients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> electrolytes) within the lumen of the intestine, resulting in a net increase in the water content of the intestinal contents. Increased concentrations of osmotically active particles within the lumen occur through three primary mechanisms: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Loss of nutrient absorption or the presence of nonabsorbable solutes</strong> in the intestinal lumen ((<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113254\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113254 \">figure 3</a>), panel B). Examples include the loss of nutrient absorption seen in celiac disease or in inflammation, and diarrhea caused by laxatives such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyethylene-glycol-3350-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">polyethylene glycol 3350</a>. This mechanism underlies diet-induced (previously classified as osmotic) diarrhea, which improves with fasting.

Examples include diarrhea secondary to infection with <em>Vibrio Cholerae</em>, which causes excessive secretion of chloride and loss of electroneutral sodium absorption. This mechanism underlies electrolyte transport-related (previously classified as secretory) diarrhea, which fails to improve with fasting. (See <a href=\"#H2315749951\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of altered fluid transport in diarrheal diseases'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4221532165\" class=\"local\">'Electrolyte transport-related (secretory)'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rapid intestinal transit</strong> resulting in reduced time for fluid absorption ((<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113254\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113254 \">figure 3</a>), panel D). Examples include a variety of conditions that cause hypermotility of the intestine, including the functional diarrhea seen in infants and toddlers (sometimes termed &quot;toddlers diarrhea&quot;). (See <a href=\"#H3155008379\" class=\"local\">'Motility-related'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of chronic diarrhea in children in resource-rich countries&quot;, section on 'Functional diarrhea'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Many of the underlying etiologies of diarrhea in children cause diarrhea through a combination of these primary mechanisms. For example, in inflammatory bowel disease, inflammation causes a loss of absorptive surface area and capacity causing loss of nutrient transport as well as increasing active Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion and intestinal motility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2315749951\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanisms of altered fluid transport in diarrheal diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alterations in fluid transport between the intestinal lumen and the body underlie many of the causes of diarrheal illness. </p><p>Several common diarrheal conditions are characterized by loss of nutrient-driven electrolyte transport. As an example, patients with lactase deficiency are unable to hydrolyze lactose into glucose and galactose. This leads to loss of fluid absorption driven by the Na<sup>+</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/glucose</span> co-transporter (SGLT1), and increased osmolality in the intestinal lumen. Lactase deficiency can be either acquired (eg, due to mucosal injury from enteric injury from infection or celiac disease), congenital (loss of function mutation in the lactase gene), or genetically driven age-dependent acquired deficiency (hypolactasia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H8136967\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lactose intolerance: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Primary lactose malabsorption'</a>.) </p><p>Certain enterotoxigenic pathogens cause diarrhea by stimulating fluid secretion. As examples, <em>Vibrio Cholerae</em> and enterotoxigenic <em>Escherichia coli</em> release bacterial enterotoxins (cholera toxin, heat-stable enterotoxin), which alter the intracellular levels of second messenger molecules such as cAMP, cGMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113256\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113256 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-diarrhea-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These signal to the key channels that drive fluid absorption and secretion. Cholera toxin induces elevations in cAMP leading to activation of the chloride channel CFTR and inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup> exchanger NHE3, resulting in a massive secretory diarrhea. Bacteria can also increase various humoral agonists, neurotransmitters or neuropeptide receptors such as 5-hydroxytryptamine, vasoactive intestinal peptides<strong> </strong>(VIP) and the galanin receptor type 1, also activating Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> secretion and inhibiting Na<sup>+</sup> absorption. Similarly, diarrhea caused by viruses is partly due to the action of viral enterotoxins such as rotavirus NSP4, resulting in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation, inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup> absorption, and increased Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113256\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113256 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-diarrhea-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rotavirus-infection#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rotavirus infection&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Other bacteria cause diarrhea through an inflammatory mechanism. Invasive bacteria such as Salmonella and Shigella cause a tissue inflammatory response involving recruitment of immune cells and release of cytokines, resulting in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Enteropathogenic and invasive bacteria also result in alterations in channel protein expression, with consequent impaired Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> absorption. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholera-microbiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cholera: Microbiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenic-escherichia-coli#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenic Escherichia coli&quot;, section on 'Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shigella-infection-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shigella infection: Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4061881173\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of the colon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the bulk of daily fluid absorption is carried out in the small intestine, any disease that significantly affects the small intestine (eg, celiac disease, short bowel syndrome, enteric infections) can result in clinically significant diarrhea. However, fluid absorption in the colon can often compensate for moderate loss of small intestinal absorptive function. </p><p>Although the colon absorbs a much smaller volume of fluid than the small intestine, it is critical for the generation of formed (dehydrated) feces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-diarrhea-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Therefore, any condition that alters colonic fluid transport or increases colonic motility tends to result in abnormally watery stool and therefore diarrhea.</p><p>The colonic microbiome also plays an important role in driving fluid absorption in the colon. Colonic bacteria participate in the fermentation of dietary carbohydrates unabsorbed by the small intestine, to produce short-chain fatty acids such as acetate, propionate and butyrate. These are rapidly absorbed in the colon, enhancing absorption of Na<sup>+</sup> and water, and secretion of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Disruption of short-chain fatty acid production may therefore play a role in antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Conversely, stabilization of the colonic microbiome through the administration of probiotics can reduce diarrhea associated with antibiotic use. Alterations to commensal bacteria in the colon after antibiotic administration allows opportunistic pathogens such as <em>Clostridium difficile</em> to displace the normal flora and can result in toxin-mediated inflammation and diarrhea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries#H1704438040\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to diarrhea in children in resource-rich countries&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic-associated diarrhea'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clostridium-difficile-and-probiotics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clostridium difficile and probiotics&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The presence of excessive bile acids in the colon as occurs in ileal resection or disease (eg, Crohn disease) leads to activation of colonic Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion resulting in bile-acid diarrhea (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of short bowel syndrome in children&quot;, section on 'Watery diarrhea'</a>). A bile acid-enriched state is thought to occur in a subset of patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, inducing fluid secretion as well as reducing the transit time through the colon, resulting in incomplete fecal dehydration and diarrhea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults#H2956840\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Bile acid sequestrants'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H52441743\"><span class=\"h1\">DIARRHEA CLASSIFICATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4001984028\"><span class=\"h2\">Terminology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Previous classifications have divided diarrhea into osmotic, secretory, inflammatory, and motility-related categories, but these terms can be misleading for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osmotic diarrhea &ndash; The term &quot;osmotic diarrhea&quot; is traditionally used to refer to diarrhea resulting from unabsorbed solutes or nutrients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113254\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113254 \">figure 3</a>), but this use is misleading since all diarrhea involves osmotic forces. We prefer to use the more precise term, &quot;diet-induced diarrhea&quot; (or &quot;substrate-induced diarrhea&quot;). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secretory diarrhea &ndash; The term &quot;secretory diarrhea&quot; is also problematic because it has different definitions that are often used interchangeably. Some authors use the term to refer to diarrhea caused by active ion secretion into the intestine; this definition is problematic because it does not include watery diarrhea caused by defects in intestinal sodium absorption (eg, due to some causes of congenital sodium diarrhea and in viral infections). Others use the term to describe diarrhea with a low stool osmotic gap (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-chronic-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with chronic diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;, section on 'Secretory diarrhea'</a>). This definition is also problematic because a low stool osmotic gap generally results from a combination of anion-driven fluid secretion and loss of Na<sup>+</sup>-driven fluid absorption. Referring to this type of diarrhea as only &quot;secretory&quot; is therefore somewhat misleading. Because of these definitional issues, we prefer to use the more precise term, &quot;electrolyte-transport related diarrhea&quot; rather than &quot;secretory diarrhea.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mixed diarrhea &ndash; Lastly, diarrhea that is obviously neither &quot;secretory&quot; or &quot;osmotic,&quot; or has an intermediate stool osmotic gap has been referred to &quot;mixed.&quot; Although intermediate values for the stool osmotic gap occur frequently, these often reflect the dietary intake at the time of testing. From a diagnostic standpoint, this category is rarely helpful. </p><p/><p>Despite the above caveats, the terms &quot;osmotic&quot; and &quot;secretory&quot; diarrhea are widely used clinically and historically and for the purposes of this topic review we will refer to both the existing terms and our newer terminology. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1881281505\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet-induced (osmotic)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diet-induced diarrhea occurs when osmotically-active substances are present in the intestinal lumen, resulting in water retention. This can occur because of loss of absorption of a dietary solute, such as lactose, or administration of a nonabsorbable solute such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyethylene-glycol-3350-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">polyethylene glycol 3350</a> (PEG 3350). Because this form of diarrhea is driven by osmotically-active ingested nutrients (eg, carbohydrates) or exogenous substances (eg, osmotic laxative), the diarrhea will abate during fasting. Thus, a trial of fasting (&gt;12 hours) is a useful diagnostic test. This is ideally done in a hospital to carefully monitor both stool output and hydration status, but can also be inferred from the history if the diarrhea abates during either deliberate or inadvertent fasting. </p><p>Primary lactose intolerance or PEG 3350 ingestion are examples of diarrheas with a purely osmotic mechanism. A diet-induced mechanism can also contribute to diarrhea from a variety of other causes. For example, enteric infections and inflammatory conditions such as salmonella and inflammatory bowel disease can cause damage to intestinal epithelial cells and loss of absorptive surface area, leading to impaired nutrient absorption and diet-induced diarrhea.

The distinguishing clinical characteristic is that this type of diarrhea will persist unabated during fasting because it is independent of ingested osmotically-active nutrients. Several types of diarrheal diseases fall into this category:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Enterotoxigenic bacteria</strong> &ndash; The classic example of electrolyte transport-related diarrhea (although rarely encountered in resource-rich nations) is infection with the pathogen <em>Vibrio cholerae</em>, in which the enterotoxin, cholera toxin, causes massive (liters) fluid secretion of Cl<sup>-</sup> and water.

Hypomotility, or the severe impairment of intestinal peristalsis, results in stasis with subsequent bacterial overgrowth and secondary bile acid deconjugation, bile acid malabsorption, and activation of colonic secretion. In contrast, hypermotility, which probably contributes to the pathogenesis of functional diarrhea in infants and toddlers (along with excessive carbohydrate intake), can lead to diarrhea secondary to inadequate time for colonic absorption. Hypermotility also contributes to some cases of diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome.

The diarrhea can have a diet-induced component because the inflammatory process causes destruction or impairment of epithelial cells resulting in loss of surface area and transports resulting impaired nutrient absorption and increased osmotic load in the intestinal lumen (see <a href=\"#H1881281505\" class=\"local\">'Diet-induced (osmotic)'</a> above). Inflammation can also cause electrolyte transport-related diarrhea by inducing active Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion and a loss of Na<sup>+</sup> absorption (see <a href=\"#H4221532165\" class=\"local\">'Electrolyte transport-related (secretory)'</a> above). In addition, the inflammatory process also can lead to the breakdown in intestinal barrier function resulting in exudation of mucus, protein, and blood into the gut lumen (eg protein-losing enteropathy). </p><p>The most common cause of inflammatory diarrhea is infection. A number of relatively common enteric pathogens (eg, salmonella, campylobacter, clostridium difficile) cause primarily inflammatory responses resulting in either watery or often bloody diarrhea (dysentery) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to diarrhea in children in resource-rich countries&quot;, section on 'Causes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-limited-countries#H17612372\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with acute diarrhea in resource-limited countries&quot;, section on 'Infectious gastroenteritis'</a>). Intestinal inflammation can also be caused by chronic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease.

These include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oral rehydration solutions</a> and several classes of drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113257\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113257 \">table 1</a>); other candidate drugs are in development. Each of these treatments targets a different pathophysiologic cause of diarrhea, as outlined below:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1080869903\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral rehydration solution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral rehydration solution (ORS) is an orally ingested solution that stimulates intestinal Na<sup>+</sup> absorption by Na<sup>+</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/glucose</span> cotransporter 1 (SGLT1 [SLC5A1]) and Na<sup>+</sup>-coupled amino acid transporters. The World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended ORS is hypo-osmolar (245 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/L),</span> with optimized glucose to Na<sup>+</sup> ratios to increase water absorption. ORS is a highly effective treatment that relies on the fact that SGLT1 transport is preserved in electrolyte transport-related (secretory) diarrheas such as those caused by bacterial enterotoxins. Beverages commercially marketed for hydration during exercise (&quot;sports&quot; beverages) have much higher concentrations of glucose and higher osmolarity, which reduces fluid absorption; these are less effective for oral rehydration. Alternative ORS solutions including rice starch or amino acids have also been shown to be effective in maintaining hydration during diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-diarrhea-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

The putative mechanism of action for antimotility drugs is increased Na<sup>+</sup> and fluid absorption as a result of slow intestinal transit. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Loperamide</a> and diphenoxylate and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">atropine</a> are mu-opioid receptor agonists that are widely used for mild, nonspecific diarrhea. They are not recommended in bacterial diarrheas primarily owing to the risk of paralytic ileus, and diphenoxylate also has substantial central opioid effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1583020871\"><span class=\"h2\">Antisecretory agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhibiting intestinal fluid secretion is another mechanism by which some agents reduce diarrhea. Historically, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bismuth-subsalicylate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">bismuth subsalicylate</a> was shown to have antidiarrheal efficacy, although it is now rarely used. Racecadotril, an enkephalinase inhibitor, or its active metabolite thiorphan, is used in Europe and South America as an antidiarrheal agent, with varying reports of efficacy; it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. It acts via inhibition of the breakdown of endogenous enkephalins that exert antisecretory effects through enkephalin-stimulated activation of epithelial mu-opioid receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-diarrhea-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].
