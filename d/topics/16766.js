By contrast, palliative systemic therapy is appropriate for patients who have stage IV disease at presentation. Palliative systemic therapy is also used for patients who have relapsed with advanced disease following prior definitive treatment.</p><p>An improved understanding of the molecular pathways that drive malignancy in NSCLC has led to the development of agents that target specific molecular pathways in malignant cells. Therapy can then be individualized based upon the specific abnormality, if any, present in a given patient.</p><p>The use of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC that contains a somatic mutation in EGFR will be reviewed here. The use of these agents in patients without an EGFR mutation (ie, wild type EGFR) either as maintenance therapy after initial chemotherapy or as subsequent therapy after initial progression is discussed separately.

EGFR exists as a monomer on the cell surface, and it must dimerize to activate the TK. While the TK activity of EGFR is tightly controlled in normal cells, the genes encoding these receptors may have escaped from their usual intracellular inhibitory mechanisms in malignant cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F86507\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86507 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H177151213\"><span class=\"h2\">EGFR mutation as a predictor of responsiveness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advanced NSCLCs that contains characteristic mutations in EGFR are highly sensitive to EGFR TKIs.

Neurologically stable patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases were permitted in this study. Osimertinib demonstrated improvement in PFS (18.9 versus 10.2 months; HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.37-0.57) and duration of response (17.2 versus 8.5 months) relative to SOC. The PFS benefit was consistent across subgroups, including either patients with or without brain metastases. There was a nonsignificant trend towards improvement in OS (HR 0.63); however, OS results were immature, with only 25 percent of events collected. Response rates for osimertinib and SOC were 80 and 76 percent, respectively.

In regards to the latter issue, all patients would gain access to osimertinib, rather than just the subset whose tumors acquire <em>T790M </em>as a mechanism of resistance. A potential downside, however, is lack of an effective second-line targeted agent for those who would have acquired a <em>T790M</em> resistance mutation on front-line therapy with an earlier-generation TKI.
