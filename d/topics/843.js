The mechanism underlying breastfeeding anaphylaxis is unclear.

Blood for serum tryptase is optimally obtained 15 minutes to 3 hours after symptom onset. Any elevation in serum tryptase provides evidence of mast cell activation and thus supports a diagnosis of anaphylaxis, although elevated tryptase levels have also been reported in amniotic fluid embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-in-pregnant-and-breastfeeding-women/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. However, in some patients with anaphylaxis, (eg, those with food-triggered anaphylaxis or those who are normotensive), elevations in tryptase generally do not occur. A normal tryptase level cannot be used to refute the diagnosis of anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-in-pregnant-and-breastfeeding-women/abstract/2,6,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,62</a>].</p><p>The serum tryptase assay is standardized (in contrast to the histamine assay) and is widely available in clinical laboratories, although results can seldom be obtained on an urgent basis.

It significantly reduces the patient's risk of anaphylaxis or other systemic reactions to stinging insect venom and provides protection for years after injections are discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-in-pregnant-and-breastfeeding-women/abstract/2,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,98</a>].</p><p>Tests for VIT and initiation of VIT are not typically performed during pregnancy due to the small but definite risk of anaphylaxis during the initial dose escalation.

However, it is important to recognize it rapidly and treat it effectively, as the maternal hypoxia and hypotension that can result may be catastrophic to both mother and fetus. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anaphylaxis may present with various combinations of up to 40 potential symptoms and signs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66333\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66333 \">table 1</a>). Common features include pruritus (sometimes involving the vagina and vulva), urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, tachycardia, and hypotension. In pregnant women, anaphylaxis may also induce lower back pain, uterine cramping, nonreassuring fetal heart rate, and preterm labor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F87183\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87183 \">figure 1</a>). Fetal asphyxia, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, or death can occur. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Triggers of anaphylaxis in pregnancy include those that typically induce it in community settings (eg, foods, drugs, or insect stings) and those that are specifically encountered in medical settings, including labor and delivery, such as latex, antibiotics, and neuromuscular blocking drugs. Rarely, breastfeeding may also trigger anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Triggers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of anaphylaxis in pregnancy is based on the clinical history and on physical signs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72225 \">table 2</a>). It is sometimes confirmed by laboratory tests, such as an elevated serum total tryptase level. However, a tryptase level that is within normal limits cannot be used to refute the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal hypoxemia and hypotension in anaphylaxis are associated with a high risk of fetal asphyxia or death, even when the maternal outcome is favorable. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical management of anaphylaxis in a pregnant woman is similar to management in the nonpregnant patient and involves prompt intramuscular injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, adequate supplemental oxygen, and intravenous fluid resuscitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F87553\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87553 \">table 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F87184\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87184 \">figure 2</a>). The fetal heart rate should be monitored if the fetus has reached a viable gestational age. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of anaphylaxis during pregnancy begins with a careful history to uncover any past allergic reactions that may provide clues about potential allergies to foods, medications, insect stings, latex, or other allergens. Women with past anaphylaxis should prepare for a potential recurrence (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjector, anaphylaxis emergency action plan, and medical identification).
