The primary risk factors associated with head and neck cancer include tobacco use, alcohol consumption, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (for oropharyngeal cancer), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (for nasopharyngeal cancer). The chronic exposure of the upper aerodigestive tract to these carcinogenic factors can result in dysplastic or premalignant lesions in the oropharyngeal mucosa and ultimately result in head and neck cancer. The relative prevalence of these risk factors contributes to the variations in the observed distribution of head and neck cancer in different areas of the world.</p><p>The epidemiology of head and neck cancer and the risk factors for and pathogenesis of these tumors will be reviewed here. Issues related to pathology, diagnosis, staging, and therapy are considered separately. (See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Worldwide, head and neck cancer accounts for more than 550,000 cases and 380,000 deaths annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the United States, head and neck cancer accounts for 3 percent of malignancies, with approximately 63,000 Americans developing head and neck cancer annually and 13,000 dying from the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In Europe, there were approximately 250,000 cases (an estimated 4 percent of the cancer incidence) and 63,500 deaths in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Males are affected significantly more than females, with a ratio ranging from 2:1 to 4:1. The incidence rate in males exceeds 20 per 100,000 in regions of France, Hong Kong, the Indian subcontinent, Central and Eastern Europe, Spain, Italy, and Brazil, and among African Americans in the United States. Mouth and tongue cancers are more common in the Indian subcontinent, nasopharyngeal cancer is more common in Hong Kong, and pharyngeal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laryngeal cancers are more common in other populations; these factors contribute disproportionately to the overall cancer burden in these Asian countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>The incidence of laryngeal cancer, but not oral cavity and pharyngeal cancer, is approximately 50 percent higher in African American men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The mortality associated with both laryngeal and oropharyngeal cancer is significantly higher in African American men, which may reflect the lower prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) positivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

There appears to be a dose-response relationship, as illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A case-control study compared 605 patients with head and neck cancer with 756 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The relative risk (RR) in current tobacco users was 6.5. The RR increased with the duration of smoking and gradually declined after smoking cessation, with no excess risk at 20 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another case-control study, patients who smoked more than one pack of cigarettes per day had a 13-fold increase in risk of head and neck cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The age of starting smoking (below 18 years of age) and duration of smoking (over 35 years) were high-risk factors. Cessation of smoking was associated with a significant decrease in RR.</p><p/><p>Other tobacco exposures are also associated with an increased risk of head and neck cancer. Both cigar and pipe smoking are associated with an increased incidence of head and neck cancer, and this increase in risk is present even in those who have never smoked cigarettes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Smokeless tobacco (both chewing tobacco and snuff) is associated with an increased risk of cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Secondhand smoke exposure may be a contributing factor. One report evaluated 59 patients with head and neck cancer who did not use tobacco and, with rare exceptions, did not abuse alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These patients had a significantly higher risk of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in both the workplace and home than a control population without cancer. This relationship primarily occurred in women and those with tongue cancer. </p><p>In never smokers, the use of smokeless tobacco products appears to be associated with an increased risk of head and neck cancer, particularly for malignancies arising in the oral cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In never smokers using snuff, the risk of head and neck cancer was significantly increased compared with never users of snuff (odds ratio [OR] 1.71, 95% CI 1.08-2.70, and OR for oral cavity cancers 3.01, 95% CI 1.63-5.55). The association with chewing tobacco was weaker and was statistically significant only for cancers of the oral cavity (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.04-3.17).</p><p>Evidence regarding the association of marijuana use and the development of head and neck cancer is somewhat conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. Reporting and selection bias as well as confounding by alcohol and tobacco use limit the ability of observational studies to exclude or confirm this relationship.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Alcohol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alcohol consumption independently increases the risk of cancer in the upper aerodigestive tract, although it is often difficult to separate the effects of smoking and alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/10,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,20-22</a>]. The RR of developing head and neck cancer due to alcohol appears to be dose dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/12,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,21,22</a>]. As an example, one study reported a five- to sixfold increased risk for head and neck cancer with alcohol intake greater than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> versus less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> (one drink contains approximately 12 g of alcohol) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Alcohol intake and tobacco smoking appear to have an interactive and multiplicative effect on the risk of developing head and neck cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/10-13,21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13,21,23</a>]. </p><p>There may be an interaction of genetic susceptibility and alcohol intake on the risk of developing head and neck cancer with genetic polymorphisms of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple types of viral infections have been associated with an increased risk of head and neck cancer, including particularly EBV, HPV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Epstein-Barr virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a relatively rare malignancy in most populations but is one of the most common cancers in southern China. A large body of evidence supports the role of EBV as the primary etiologic agent in the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-etiology-and-diagnosis-of-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma#H308758431\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, etiology, and diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Epstein-Barr virus'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-etiology-and-diagnosis-of-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, etiology, and diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While several investigators report finding EBV in oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>], others refute such a relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].

HPV associated oropharyngeal cancers are typically seen in younger men who are nonusers of tobacco and alcohol. HPV associated head and neck cancer is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus associated head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Herpes simplex virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is less strongly correlated with the development of oral carcinomas than EBV or HPV. Serologic studies have shown that patients with head and neck cancer have higher levels of the immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to HSV type 1 than control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. HSV can transform cells in vitro into a malignant phenotype. This may be due to an HSV-encoded peptide that increases the mutagenicity of infected cells. In one series of 31 young adults with head and neck cancer, antipeptide antibody levels were significantly higher in the patients than in the control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2817904633\"><span class=\"h3\">Hepatitis C virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic infection with HCV is strongly associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma and has also been associated with other malignancies, including lymphoproliferative disorders. </p><p>A cohort study that included 409 patients with head and neck cancer and 694 controls with lung, esophageal, or urinary bladder cancer analyzed the incidence of HCV positivity and HCV infection, defined by the presence of HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) in serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. HCV antibodies were present in a significantly higher proportion of patients with both oropharyngeal and nonoropharyngeal cancers compared with the control group (14.0 and 20.0 versus 6.5 percent), as was HCV RNA (10.7 and 15.5 versus 3.4 percent). This effect persisted when adjusting for potential confounding variables. An exploratory subgroup analysis found this effect was limited to HPV positive oropharyngeal cancers, oral cavity cancer, and larynx cancer, but not HPV negative oropharyngeal cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, or hypopharyngeal cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H716724933\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunodeficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunodeficiency due to infection with HIV or solid organ transplantation has been associated with an increased risk of cancer in the head and neck region.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients infected with HIV have an increased incidence of a variety of non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining malignancies. There is an approximately two- to threefold increase in the incidence of SCC of the head and neck in patients infected with HIV; other histologic types of cancer may also be increased.

As an example, in a series of 2817 organ recipients, 175 patients developed 391 head and neck malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, the great majority of these were cutaneous malignancies, with 51 percent being SCC and 42 percent being basal cell carcinomas. An additional 2 percent were papillary thyroid cancer, 1 percent SCC of the tongue, and 3 percent of miscellaneous mucosal sites, including the larynx, oral cavity, nasal cavity, oropharynx, nasopharynx, and salivary duct.
