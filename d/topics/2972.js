A discussion of carnitine metabolism, as well as the role of carnitine supplementation in this patient population, is presented in this topic review.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF CARNITINE IN INTERMEDIARY METABOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carnitine is an important intermediary in fat metabolism. It is required to shuttle long-chain fatty acids, in the form of acylcarnitines, into mitochondria for beta-oxidation; carnitine is, therefore, crucial for energy production in tissues dependent upon fatty acid oxidation, such as cardiac and skeletal muscle.</p><p>Reactions of carnitine with activated fatty acids (acyl CoA) are esterifications of the general form:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>acyl CoA + carnitine -&gt; acylcarnitine + CoASH</p></div></div><p>and are catalyzed by a family of carnitine acyltransferases.</p><p>Besides fatty acid oxidation, functions of carnitine include modulating the concentration of CoA, scavenging toxic acyl groups, and facilitating their transport out of mitochondria. Impaired fatty acid metabolism and consequent accumulation of acyl CoA are characteristic of renal failure. Acyl CoAs inhibit numerous enzymes important in intermediary metabolism and thereby increase insulin resistance, apoptosis, generation of free radicals, and lipid peroxidation products. Conversion of acyl CoA to acylcarnitine and transport out of mitochondria constitutes a normal scavenger system for toxic acyl groups that are generated in excess in renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RENAL HANDLING AND METABOLISM OF CARNITINE IN RENAL FAILURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While carnitine is derived from red meat and dairy products in the diet, biosynthesis in the liver, kidney, and brain is adequate to meet normal requirements in healthy individuals. Approximately 95 percent of carnitine is stored in muscle, where it is concentrated by a specific transporter. Free carnitine is filtered at the glomerulus, and over 90 percent undergoes tubular reabsorption. By contrast, renal tubular absorption of acylcarnitine is limited, and clearance of acylcarnitine is four to eight times greater than that of free carnitine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Such differential clearance is consistent with the concept that esterification with carnitine is a pathway for detoxification and elimination of toxic acyl groups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Alterations in chronic kidney dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In chronic kidney dysfunction, clearance of both free carnitine and acylcarnitine is reduced. Plasma levels of free and total carnitine are unchanged, but serum acylcarnitine rises in inverse relation to the decline of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The ratio of acylcarnitine to free carnitine is markedly increased.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolism in hemodialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In hemodialysis patients, plasma total carnitine concentration is normal or elevated; the free carnitine concentration is reduced (19.2 to 32.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> and significantly lower than in healthy controls (40 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> or in chronic kidney disease (CKD); the acylcarnitine concentration is markedly increased, and the ratio of acyl to free carnitine (AC:FC) is markedly increased (0.77 to 0.96) compared with healthy controls (0.15 to 0.25) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>].</p><p>Several factors contribute to this abnormal profile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of renal parenchyma removes a source of endogenous carnitine synthesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low dietary intake of meat and dairy products deprives patients of a rich source of carnitine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodialysis removes free carnitine and acylcarnitine. Although total dialytic removal is probably comparable with normal urinary excretion, free carnitine clearance by hemodialysis is greater than that of acylcarnitine. This pattern is the reverse of normal urinary carnitine excretion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatty acid metabolism is impaired in renal failure. Thus, incompletely metabolized acyl residues accumulate and drive the formation of acylcarnitine esters.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The normal preferential renal excretion of acylcarnitine is lost in renal failure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolism in peritoneal dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metabolism of carnitine in peritoneal dialysis patients has not been sufficiently studied. Available information indicates that total and free plasma carnitine are normal, and plasma acylcarnitine is elevated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Carnitine deficiency and dialysis patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An AC:FC ratio &gt;0.4 indicates a disorder of fatty acid metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. Excessive generation of acyl moieties because of incomplete fatty acid oxidation enhances formation of acylcarnitines and uses up free carnitine; thus, a high AC:FC ratio and free carnitine deficiency may be a consequence as well as a cause of abnormal fatty acid metabolism. Conversion to intensive (nocturnal) hemodialysis (five to six sessions per week, eight hours per treatment) reduced free and acylcarnitine levels and improved (reduced) the AC:FC ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This improvement could be due to amelioration of impaired fatty acid oxidation.</p><p>Effective carnitine deficiency exists if free carnitine is inadequate to meet metabolic needs; such carnitine deficiency further impairs fatty acid oxidation. However, the plasma carnitine profile does not predict whether effective carnitine deficiency exists. The vast majority (95 percent) of hemodialysis patients have low free plasma carnitine, but neither plasma total, free, or acylcarnitine nor their ratios predict clinical response to L-carnitine supplements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. By comparison, tissue (muscle or erythrocyte) total carnitine levels sometimes correlate with clinically significant endpoints.</p><p>L-carnitine supplementation increases plasma total, free, and acylcarnitine levels; the AC:FC ratio falls (improves) only moderately and incompletely, suggesting that carnitine continues to bind acyl residues that are present in excess in dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The decline of free carnitine levels depends on dialysis vintage. In a study of 21 patients, plasma L-carnitine levels principally decreased within the first few months of beginning hemodialysis, while levels in muscle continued to decline, even after one year of dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These findings are consistent with a pharmacokinetic model of L-carnitine in patients receiving hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES OF CARNITINE DEFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Much of our knowledge of the consequences of carnitine deficiency comes from inherited cases in children. In these children without kidney disease, the features of carnitine deficiency include muscle weakness, acute encephalopathy, hepatic dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, nonketotic hypoglycemia, frequent infections, and failure to thrive.</p><p>Carnitine deficiency in dialysis patients has been termed dialysis-related carnitine deficiency (DCD); it is distinguished from primary and secondary carnitine deficiency syndromes on the grounds that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carnitine deficiency in DCD is relative and due to disparity between carnitine availability and metabolic needs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ratio of acylcarnitine to free carnitine is increased.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic improvement requires pharmacologic doses rather than physiologic replacement.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CARNITINE SUPPLEMENTATION IN DIALYSIS PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is difficult to clearly ascribe benefits with L-carnitine supplementation in dialysis patients because of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The symptoms of carnitine deficiency (including muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy) overlap with those of dialysis patients generally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory evidence of abnormal carnitine metabolism is ubiquitous in this population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The response to carnitine supplementation cannot be predicted from plasma carnitine profiles.</p><p/><p>There are numerous studies supporting the view that L-carnitine supplementation improves the plasma lipid profile, exercise capacity and oxygen utilization, muscle strength, intradialytic symptoms, sense of well-being, hospitalization rate, inflammatory markers, protein metabolism, left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac function, anemia, and response to erythropoietin. In many of these instances, the physiologic rationale for administration of L-carnitine is appealing.</p><p>However, data evaluating these possible benefits of L-carnitine supplementation in hemodialysis patients are limited, with many trials being uncontrolled and small in size. Although some controlled, prospective studies have been performed, trials have been limited by small size, inclusion of patients independent of signs and symptoms of carnitine deficiency, and relatively short follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>In general, a growing literature supports benefits with L-carnitine supplementation on inflammation and muscle wasting.

In general, results from different trials have found that L-carnitine has beneficial effects on inflammation, the oxidative state, and protein metabolism in dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/4,9,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,12-14</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a controlled trial, L-carnitine supplementation reduced blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and plasma concentrations of creatinine and phosphate compared with placebo and increased mid-arm muscle circumference, suggesting a decline in muscle catabolism; however, the constancy of delivered dialysis and diet was not verified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two placebo-controlled trials in hemodialysis patients independently demonstrated that intravenous (IV) L-carnitine (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> body weight three times a week for six months) reduced serum C-reactive protein and increased albumin, transferrin, and body mass index (BMI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized, controlled trial showed that L-carnitine administration reduced serum amyloid A protein in dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized, controlled trial (n = 102, 51 in each study group), L-carnitine 900 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> orally reduced skin deposition of advanced glycation end-products determined by an autofluorescence technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>L-carnitine supplementation may therefore be considered in the patient with muscle wasting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inflammation, as defined by weight loss that is not otherwise explained, high C-reactive protein level, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreasing anthropometric measures (eg, mid-arm muscle circumference).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Lipid metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since L-carnitine supplementation increases fatty acid oxidation and reduces myocardial fatty acid retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], it is plausible that such supplementation may improve hyperlipidemia in this population. However, there is no consensus on the effect of L-carnitine on hyperlipidemia (elevated triglycerides and reduced high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol) in hemodialysis patients (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipid abnormalities in nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a>). A 2002 meta-analysis, for example, found no beneficial effect of L-carnitine on serum lipid profiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>These negative results may be due to the use of different doses <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> route of administration.

However, when muscle metabolism and function were assessed by magnetic resonance or near-infrared spectroscopy, L-carnitine supplementation for 16 weeks in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis showed no effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>These disparate results for the effect of L-carnitine supplementation on exercise capacity may reflect a failure to select a severely carnitine-deficient population, such as long-term dialysis patients. They also suggest that impairment of muscle energetics in some dialysis patients is due not only to carnitine deficiency, but to other defects in fatty acid metabolism, such as carnitine palmitoyl transferase deficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Intradialytic complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>L-carnitine may improve cardiac and skeletal muscle energy metabolism, thereby possibly ameliorating intradialytic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, a 2008 meta-analysis that included 193 patients found no effect of L-carnitine on intradialytic hypotension and only a tendency to ameliorate muscle cramps, which did not achieve statistical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

In a randomized, controlled trial of 50 patients studied for 24 weeks, L-carnitine supplementation improved short form-36 (SF-36) scores and reduced erythropoietin doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, in the randomized trial cited above, L-carnitine supplementation had no effect on the SF-36 scores and did not change erythropoietin responsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The effect of carnitine supplementation on erythropoietin responsiveness is discussed elsewhere.

Thus, the major deterrent to an empiric trial in patients with symptoms compatible with carnitine deficiency is cost and convenience.</p><p>The evidence is not definitive that L-carnitine supplementation in dialysis patients improves exercise capacity, cardiomyopathy, or intradialytic symptoms. On the other hand, a growing body of work supports benefit on inflammation and muscle wasting. Since many of the putative benefits of L-carnitine remain anecdotal and are confined to an unpredictable subset of the dialysis population, refinement of the definition of carnitine deficiency in dialysis patients is needed to better understand the use of the agent in this setting.</p><p>As response to L-carnitine supplementation cannot be predicted from laboratory evidence of carnitine deficiency, close follow-up and objective clinical end points are required when L-carnitine supplements are prescribed. Clinicians should be hesitant to add the cost of this supplement to the high expense of maintenance dialysis if an empiric course of treatment shows no benefit.</p><p>The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) Carnitine Consensus Conference recommended that the clinical response to L-carnitine be evaluated at three-month intervals and the agent discontinued if no clinical improvement has occurred within 9 to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Measurement of plasma carnitine levels to predict response or monitor treatment has not been useful. However, the Centers for Medical and Medicaid Services (CMS) has required a predialysis plasma-free carnitine level &lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> to qualify L-carnitine administration for reimbursement.</p><p>Despite the recommendations of expert consensus groups and the approval of reimbursement by the CMS, we do not believe that existing evidence is strong enough to endorse the use of L-carnitine for any of the indications for which it has been recommended. Potential uses of L-carnitine in dialysis patients include anemia resistant to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, dialysis-related hypotension, muscle wasting, weight loss, biochemical evidence of inflammation, and cardiomyopathy. The expense of IV administration of L-carnitine is an important reason to discourage its use, especially if medical resources become increasingly scarce. As an IV medication, L-carnitine is included in the bundle of reimbursed dialysis services and, therefore, is not specifically reimbursed. National dialysis chains do not approve L-carnitine for use in their patients, a decision with which we agree. If L-carnitine is administered, the course should be limited to three to six months, and objective evidence of benefit should be sought.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">L-carnitine dose and route of administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the toxicity of D-carnitine, racemic mixtures of D- and L-carnitine should <strong>not</strong> be used. Optimal dosing is not defined for L-carnitine. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use specifically of the IV formulation of L-carnitine in dialysis patients. A dose of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV after dialysis has been employed in several controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/8,9,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,12-14</a>] and has been recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/38,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,41</a>]. Higher doses (up to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> have been used, but total doses &gt;3 grams may increase platelet aggregation. Lower doses (&lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> have been used in hyperlipidemias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>L-carnitine is not routinely administered in peritoneal dialysate. However, L-carnitine may be an effective glucose-sparing osmotic agent that enhances viability of mesothelial cells among peritoneal dialysis patients. In a preliminary study of four patients receiving peritoneal dialysis for five days, equimolar L-carnitine was substituted for dextrose and yielded comparable if not superior ultrafiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Oral carnitine is <strong>not</strong> recommended because of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High oral doses are required because of limited bioavailability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In addition, data on the efficacy of oral L-carnitine are limited.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toxic metabolites of oral carnitine (trimethylamine [TMA] and trimethylamine-N-oxide [TMAO]) are generated by the intestinal microbiome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. These toxic metabolites accumulate between dialysis sessions, even in patients who are not receiving oral L-carnitine supplements, but are efficiently cleared by dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In dialysis patients who receive oral L-carnitine 1 g daily, plasma concentrations of TMAO continue to rise after two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. TMA and TMAO may cause cognitive impairment and malodorous breath characteristic of uremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] and have been associated with major adverse cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>].

Although effective carnitine deficiency exists if free carnitine is inadequate to meet metabolic needs, the plasma carnitine profile does <strong>not</strong> predict whether effective carnitine deficiency exists. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Renal handling and metabolism of carnitine in renal failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children with carnitine deficiency but without kidney disease, the features of carnitine deficiency include muscle weakness, acute encephalopathy, hepatic dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, nonketotic hypoglycemia, frequent infections, and failure to thrive. Carnitine deficiency in dialysis patients (DCD) is distinguished from these carnitine deficiency syndromes in that DCD is relative and due to the disparity between carnitine availability and metabolic needs, and symptomatic improvement requires pharmacologic doses rather than physiologic replacement. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features of carnitine deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is often difficult to ascribe benefits to L-carnitine supplementation in dialysis patients. This is because the symptoms of carnitine deficiency overlap with those of dialysis patients generally, laboratory evidence of abnormal carnitine metabolism is ubiquitous, and the response to carnitine supplementation cannot be predicted from plasma carnitine profiles. It is, however, safe for long-term administration, at least by the intravenous (IV) route. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Carnitine supplementation in dialysis patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no strong evidence that L-carnitine supplementation in dialysis patients improves muscle wasting or weight loss, exercise capacity, cardiomyopathy, or intradialytic symptoms, although it appears to be safe. Among dialysis patients, we recommend <strong>not</strong> administering oral L-carnitine (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).
