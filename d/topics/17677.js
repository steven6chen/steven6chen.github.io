These fibrils adopt a beta-pleated sheet configuration that leads to characteristic histologic changes. Amyloid deposits can occur in a variety of organs, with involvement of the heart, kidney, liver, and autonomic nervous system most often being responsible for morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of amyloidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The frequency of cardiac involvement varies among types of amyloidosis. The prognosis of amyloid cardiomyopathy also varies among types of amyloidosis, with high mortality rates particularly in light-chain (AL) amyloidosis.</p><p>This topic will review the treatment of amyloid cardiomyopathy. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of amyloid cardiomyopathy are discussed separately.

Patients with familial or senile (ATTR) amyloidosis generally respond better to HF therapy than patients with AL amyloidosis. However, there are more therapeutic options for addressing the underlying disease in AL amyloidosis, and if the plasma cell dyscrasia can be controlled, there is often a relatively rapid decrease in serum biomarkers of HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16788156\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart failure therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17203130\"><span class=\"h3\">Approach to heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of HF in patients with cardiac amyloidosis differs from the therapy generally recommended in patients with diastolic or systolic HF. While loop diuretics are a mainstay of treatment of cardiac amyloidosis, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors may be harmful despite their efficacy in other types of systolic HF. Similarly, calcium channel blockers that may be useful in treatment of diastolic HF are contraindicated in amyloid cardiomyopathy. Adverse responses to drugs in cardiac amyloidosis are likely due to its unique pathophysiologic features. </p><p>HF in cardiac amyloidosis is due to a combination of decreased myocardial compliance and disrupted and compressed myocardial cells, caused by physical infiltration of amyloid deposits. In addition, there is experimental evidence that excessive circulating free light chains in AL amyloidosis are cardiotoxic, possibly explaining the worse prognosis in cardiac AL amyloidosis than TTR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy#H165325929\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of amyloid cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'Types of amyloidosis that may involve the heart'</a>.)</p><p>The pathological changes that result from extensive amyloid infiltration result in a non-dilated normal to small left ventricular cavity size, with impaired filling because of decreased compliance. In late-stage disease, the left ventricular ejection fraction is reduced without the ability of the LV to undergo compensatory dilation as it does in most other cardiac diseases. In addition, the infiltration of the atria may severely impair atrial contraction, further decreasing ventricular filling. This combination results in a decreased stroke volume and cardiac output and marked elevation of intracardiac pressures. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15688389\"><span class=\"h3\">Medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loop diuretics are a mainstay of the management of HF. If edema is severe, hospitalization and a course of intravenous diuretics should be strongly considered. This should be accompanied by careful monitoring of blood pressure and renal function, as overvigorous diuresis may result in progressive azotemia. Aldosterone antagonist therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a>) in conjunction with loop diuretics is generally tolerated without the development of excessive hypotension.</p><p>Although beta blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with systolic HF generally, they have no proven benefit in patients with HF due to cardiac amyloidosis. Indeed, they may worsen HF in patients with cardiac amyloidosis in whom cardiac output is dependent on heart rate due to presence of a low, fixed stroke volume.</p><p>The safety and efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with cardiac amyloidosis is uncertain. There are no clinical trials of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in amyloidosis, but clinical experience has shown that these agents often provoke profound hypotension in AL amyloidosis, possibly by exposing a subclinical autonomic neuropathy. ACE inhibitors and ARBs appear to be better tolerated in patients with senile cardiac amyloidosis, in whom autonomic neuropathy is rare. Tolerability of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in TTR cardiomyopathy due to a mutant protein depends on the presence or absence of concomitant neuropathic features. If a trial of ACE inhibition is attempted in a patient with AL amyloidosis, initiation should be with a very low dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a> (eg, 3.125 mg) with careful blood pressure monitoring and slow, carefully monitored up-titration of the dose if tolerated.</p><p>Amyloid fibrils bind to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> and this interaction may account for increased susceptibility to digitalis toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although digoxin has no role in treating HF due to amyloid cardiomyopathy, careful use of digoxin may occasionally be of value in a patient with atrial fibrillation and a rapid ventricular response, particularly when hypotension makes beta blocker use untenable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial fibrillation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Pharmacologic therapy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Calcium channel blockers such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> that are used to slow heart rate and that may possibly improve ventricular relaxation in diastolic HF (eg, in hypertensive heart disease or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) are ineffective in cardiac amyloidosis, as the diastolic dysfunction is due to the amyloid and not to myocardial cellular dysfunction. Indeed, these drugs are contraindicated, as their negative inotropic effects may be profound, possibly because of an abnormal binding to amyloid fibrils and may depress compensatory heart rate responses to low stroke volume and cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15688512\"><span class=\"h3\">Heart transplantation and ventricular assist devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The great majority of patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis have significant noncardiac amyloidosis and are not suitable candidates for heart transplantation. For example, in one series, only 4 percent of patients had clinically isolated cardiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Early experience with cardiac transplantation in AL amyloidosis did not address the underlying plasma cell dyscrasia and, not surprisingly, the disease progressed in other organs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> returned in the transplanted heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The few major centers that accept patients with AL amyloidosis for cardiac transplantation accept only those who have disease clinically isolated to the heart and are deemed to be at too great a risk from the intensive chemotherapy required for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Heart transplantation for AL amyloidosis needs to be followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous HCT within a 12-month period. Long-term follow-up data in these patients are not yet available, but several appear to have had excellent cardiac results and a durable hematologic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. </p><p>Patients with senile systemic amyloidosis generally have the disease clinically isolated to the heart and as such would appear to be more suitable candidates. However, most patients are diagnosed in their eighth decade of life and are excluded based on their age. Nevertheless, successful heart transplantation has been carried out in a few patients with SSA who presented at a younger age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Patients with mutant TTR-derived cardiac amyloidosis are often younger than SSA patients, and may be candidates for heart transplantation, if amyloid neuropathy is absent or mild. However, since the mutant TTR is produced in the liver, most mutations may need a combined liver and heart transplant to prevent recurrence in the transplanted heart. Fourteen patients in a single center in Italy had combined liver-heart transplantation for familial amyloid cardiomyopathy between 1999 and 2012. Actuarial survival at one and five years was 93 and 82 percent, respectively, and the explanted liver was retransplanted into another (non-amyloid) recipient in 8 of 14 cases. No recurrent amyloid was reported in heart-liver recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. An exception to the requirement of liver transplantation is probably the Val122Ile mutation, common in African-Americans, in which isolated heart transplantation has been performed without documentation of recurrent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>Ventricular assist devices have been used very infrequently in cardiac amyloidosis, owing to technical difficulties when used in a restrictive cardiomyopathy as well as the presence of co-existing noncardiac amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A case of the use of total artificial heart as a bridge to transplantation in a patient with senile systemic amyloidosis has been reported, with survival for several months while the patient awaited heart transplantation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17203159\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of atrial fibrillation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response develops in a patient with AL or TTR amyloidosis, low-dose beta-blockade and careful <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> use may help with rate control (notwithstanding the above concerns about beta-blocker and digoxin use in amyloid cardiomyopathy generally). Despite severely impaired atrial contractile function, clinical improvement may occur after restoration of sinus rhythm in a patient with atrial fibrillation of recent onset, possibly due to a regularization of the heart rate. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiodarone</a> use to maintain sinus rhythm appears to be well-tolerated without specific amyloidosis-related side effects. Experience with catheter ablation for atrial arrhythmias in patients with cardiac amyloidosis is limited. Results in 26 patients over two decades indicate symptomatic improvement but without evidence of change in disease-related mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial fibrillation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-new-onset-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of new onset atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16788164\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amyloid cardiomyopathy is associated with high risk of intracardiac thrombus, predominantly in the atria.

The CHADS2 or CHADS2VA2SC score for assessing stroke risk in atrial fibrillation is not of value in cardiac amyloidosis, and all patients should be considered at very high risk regardless of the absence of a high score.</p><p>Although the role of anticoagulation in patients in sinus rhythm is uncertain, we suggest anticoagulation in patients in sinus rhythm with either a diminutive transmitral A wave or depressed left atrial appendage velocity on transesophageal echo, particularly if AL type is present. Atrial failure, even in the presence of sinus rhythm, is very common in amyloidosis and is associated with atrial thrombus formation, particularly in patients with AL type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p>Although amyloidosis is associated with increased hemorrhagic risk due to amyloid angiopathy, intestinal or bladder amyloid, or coagulopathy, major bleeding in anticoagulated patients does not seem to exceed that seen in other patients with similar non-amyloid degrees of illness, so anticoagulation should not be withheld if indicated unless a clear-cut contraindication exists. There are no controlled data on bleeding risk of oral anticoagulants in cardiac amyloidosis, but we have not found bleeding to be excessive, and have used <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or one of the newer oral anticoagulants (oral direct thrombin inhibitor or direct factor Xa inhibitor) without unanticipated problems.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is common in patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis and prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) have been suggested as an option to reduce this risk. However, electromechanical dissociation appears to be a significant cause of SCD in these patients, so the role of ICD therapy in preventing SCD in this population is unclear.</p><p>This issue was illustrated by a study in which 19 cardiac AL amyloidosis patients with history of syncope (n = 4) or high-grade ventricular arrhythmias (n = 10), or both (n = 5) received an ICD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Two subsequently underwent cardiac transplant and one died of an unrelated disease. There were six cardiac deaths, all sudden despite the ICD. One patient received appropriate shocks but later died of electromechanical dissociation, which was also the cause of death in the other five. Only one patient received appropriate ICD shocks with long-term survival. </p><p>Similar findings were reported in a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 53 patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy (33 with cardiac AL amyloidosis confirmed by endomyocardial biopsy) who had undergone ICD implantation (77 percent for primary prevention) at a single center between 2000 and 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Over a mean follow-up of 23 months, 15 patients (12 with cardiac AL amyloidosis) received at least one appropriate ICD shock, with none of these shocks occurring in patients who received the ICD strictly for primary prevention due to a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. However, there was no significant difference in survival between patients who received an appropriate ICD shock and those who did not receive any ICD shock.</p><p>Thus, the limited available clinical data do not support use of ICDs for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with cardiac amyloidosis of any etiology. In the rare patient with cardiac amyloidosis who is resuscitated from a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia, implantation of an ICD is appropriate. However, even in these cases, it offers less effective protection than in other forms of heart disease, as electromechanical dissociation can occur, either as primary terminal event or following an appropriate ICD shock.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30288781\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF THE UNDERLYING PROTEIN MISFOLDING DISORDER</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16788192\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific therapy for AL amyloidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed in detail separately, survival in patients with AL amyloidosis varies with the extent of organ involvement and median survival is as short as four to six months in those with heart failure (HF) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of amyloid cardiomyopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases#H863317\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis and light and heavy chain deposition diseases&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>). However, with earlier diagnosis, careful patient selection, and use of currently available chemotherapeutic regimens, survival can be significantly prolonged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The available medical regimens are discussed separately, but the basic principles will be reviewed here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis and light and heavy chain deposition diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In general, therapy involves the administration of chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in an attempt to eradicate the underlying plasma cell clone responsible for AL amyloid formation. The goal of therapy is to achieve a 90 percent or greater reduction in serum free light chain levels, but not all patients may be able to attain this level of response. The intensity and type of therapy chosen is affected by the number and extent of organ involvement. The most common initial chemotherapy regimens used are now bortezomib-based regimens such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>. This regimen appears superior to the older regimen of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>. ASCT involves administration of high-dose melphalan followed by stem cell rescue. The risk of treatment-related mortality associated with ASCT in AL amyloidosis restricts the use of this procedure to a small group of selected patients. </p><p>NYHA functional class III or IV HF is generally considered a contraindication to ASCT in patients with AL amyloidosis. These patients have also been classified as stage III AL amyloidosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F83742\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83742 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis and light and heavy chain deposition diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prognosis of such individuals, who have been excluded from many of the clinical therapeutic studies, was evaluated in a study of 346 Stage III patients treated with standard chemotherapeutic regimens. The median survival was seven months, with 24 percent surviving until 24 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The overall hematologic response rate was 33 percent, including a complete response rate of 12 percent. N-terminal fragment of brain-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) &gt;8500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L</span> and systolic blood pressure &lt;100 mmHg predicted a poor outcome. However, these patients were treated before the widespread use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>, and it is likely that current regimens are superior in terms of survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30288816\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific therapy of TTR amyloidosis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16788241\"><span class=\"h3\">Liver transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In ATTR amyloidosis, the source of the amyloidogenic protein is the liver. Transplantation of the liver removes the mutant amyloidogenic TTR in familial ATTR but in senile systemic amyloidosis the precursor protein is native TTR and thus liver transplantation is not indicated. Unfortunately, cardiac disease has progressed after liver transplantation in some patients with familial ATTR, even though deposits elsewhere may stabilize. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Examination of the composition of TTR in the heart of patients with progressive cardiomyopathy after liver transplantation reveals that the mechanism is enhanced deposition of wild-type TTR on a template of amyloid derived from variant TTR. Patients with advanced heart disease may be treated with combined heart and liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>Once a patient with a transthyretin mutation is found to have a positive biopsy for amyloid, he or she should undergo evaluation for liver transplantation, with the goal to receive the transplant as early in the disease as possible. If an amyloid cardiomyopathy is present with significant HF, isolated liver transplantation is contraindicated and consideration should be given to a combined liver-heart transplant or just heart alone. This appears to be particularly true in patients with the Ala60 mutation in whom cardiomyopathy is almost always present and in whom liver transplant alone does not stop progressive cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16788248\"><span class=\"h2\">Investigational agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several investigational agents are in active trials but effects on cardiac disease have not been established. Agents targeting TTR may prove beneficial for wild-type (senile) as well as familial ATTR amyloidosis. These include tafamidis, a drug that stabilizes the TTR molecule, thereby hopefully decreasing the breakdown products that form amyloid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. It has been approved in most European countries for the treatment of early amyloid polyneuropathy due to familial amyloidosis, but there have been no placebo-controlled trials in TTR cardiac amyloidosis.

(See <a href=\"#H16788156\" class=\"local\">'Heart failure therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticoagulation is recommended in patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy with atrial fibrillation, intracardiac thrombi, or an embolic event. In addition, we suggest anticoagulation in patients in sinus rhythm who have evidence of atrial contractile dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H16788164\" class=\"local\">'Anticoagulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The efficacy of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy in patients with severe cardiac amyloidosis appears to be limited. (See <a href=\"#H16788171\" class=\"local\">'Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main treatment option in patients with AL amyloidosis is chemotherapy. A variety of regimens are now used, including high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). Bortezomib-based regimens are becoming first line therapy, even in patients with advanced cardiac disease (New York Heart Association functional class III or IV) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H16788192\" class=\"local\">'Specific therapy for AL amyloidosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transplantation of the liver can be curative in selected patients with familial ATTR but not in senile systemic amyloidosis. However, cardiac disease has progressed after liver transplantation in some patients with familial ATTR. Patients with advanced heart disease with familial ATTR may be treated with combined heart and liver transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H30288816\" class=\"local\">'Specific therapy of TTR amyloidosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376706732\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The UpToDate editorial staff would like to acknowledge Dr. Rodney H.
