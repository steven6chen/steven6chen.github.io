Traditional measures of sleep quality include latency until sleep onset, wakefulness after sleep onset, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the duration of sleep. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep architecture is the structure of sleep. It is cyclical, composed of rapid eye movement (REM) and several non-REM sleep stages, and assessed primarily by electroencephalography (EEG) during polysomnography. </p><p/><p>Medication-induced changes in sleep quality <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> architecture are not synonymous with a sleep disturbance; in some cases the changes may be therapeutic, while in others they may be benign or not well understood. The effects of medications that target the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, or respiratory system on sleep quality and sleep architecture are reviewed here. The stages and architecture of normal sleep are described separately.

Both types of agents facilitate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition of cell firing by binding to a subunit of the GABA receptor complex called the benzodiazepine receptor. The GABA receptor complex is present throughout the brain, including the ventral lateral preoptic area that controls sleep.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep quality &ndash; All benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists improve sleep quality by reducing the time to sleep onset. The longer-acting agents also improve sleep quality by reducing wakefulness after sleep onset and increasing the total sleep time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-medications-on-sleep-quality-and-sleep-architecture/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep architecture &ndash; Benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists reduce the amount of stage N1 sleep (ie, light sleep), which is considered a therapeutic effect. They may also increase spindle activity during stage N2 sleep (and increase N2 percent). Benzodiazepines and the nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists have differing effects on stage N3 sleep, which are of uncertain clinical significance. Finally, benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists may modestly reduce rapid eye movement (REM) sleep when used at higher than indicated doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-medications-on-sleep-quality-and-sleep-architecture/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient-important effects &ndash; Patients report that their ease of falling asleep is improved, awakenings are reduced, and sleep time is increased.

Orexin cells located in the hypothalamus activate monoaminergic and cholinergic neurons to produce long consolidated periods of wakefulness. In narcolepsy type 1, there is an absence of orexin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Dual orexin receptor antagonists have been evaluated for the treatment of insomnia.

It is generally prescribed for the treatment of sleep onset insomnia (ie, difficulty falling asleep). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tasimelteon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tasimelteon</a>, also an MT1 and MT2 agonist, has been approved as a chronobiotic for the treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorder and non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-medications-on-sleep-quality-and-sleep-architecture/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Exogenous melatonin binds to all three melatonin receptors and is less potent than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramelteon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramelteon</a>.

There is a paucity of data regarding the MAOIs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isocarboxazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isocarboxazid</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenelzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenelzine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranylcypromine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranylcypromine</a>) but, generally speaking, they appear to increase wakefulness after sleep onset and decrease total sleep time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-medications-on-sleep-quality-and-sleep-architecture/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Studies of the effects of the SARIs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trazodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trazodone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nefazodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nefazodone</a>) on sleep quality are notable for their inconsistency, with about half of studies showing improvements in measures of sleep quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-medications-on-sleep-quality-and-sleep-architecture/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Sleep quality is the degree to which restful sleep is maintained during the night and the individual feels refreshed on waking and throughout the day. Sleep architecture is the structure of sleep; it is cyclical and composed of both rapid eye movement (REM) and several non-REM sleep stages. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central nervous system medications that affect sleep quality <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sleep architecture include benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists, antiseizure drugs, antidepressants, analgesics, and stimulants. The benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists and orexin receptor antagonists are associated with improved ease of falling asleep, reduced awakenings, increased sleep time, less daytime sleepiness, better concentration, and better daytime performance. The other central nervous system medications have a variety of effects. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Central nervous system medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac medications that affect sleep quality <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sleep architecture include lipophilic beta adrenergic blockers and centrally acting alpha adrenergic agonists. Both are associated with daytime sleepiness, while the lipophilic beta adrenergic blockers are also associated with insomnia, hallucinations, and nightmares.

Theophylline is associated with improved sleep and improved daytime alertness, whereas glucocorticoids are associated with increased awakening after sleep onset.
