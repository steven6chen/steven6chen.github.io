Because of this, the therapeutic approach is different from that used for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</p><p>Although the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system used for NSCLC is also suggested for SCLC, patients with SCLC are typically divided into those with limited stage versus extensive stage disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system for lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Limited stage disease is defined as disease confined to one hemithorax (ie, disease which can be included in a &quot;tolerable&quot; radiation field). About one-third of patients present with limited disease, although many of these patients probably already have subclinical metastatic disease. </p><p>Chemotherapy is an integral component of the treatment of patients with limited stage SCLC because of the high likelihood of early dissemination, including the minority of patients without mediastinal involvement who may be candidates for initial surgical resection. In addition, radiation therapy (RT) is important because local tumor progression occurs in up to 80 percent of patients with limited stage disease treated with chemotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylactic-cranial-irradiation-for-patients-with-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Limited-stage small cell lung cancer: Initial management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Brain metastases are a frequent problem in patients with SCLC, and brain imaging (preferably MRI) is indicated for patients who present with either limited or extensive stage disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylactic-cranial-irradiation-for-patients-with-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathobiology and staging of small cell carcinoma of the lung&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>.)</p><p>Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for patients without detectable brain metastases can decrease the frequency of subsequent intracranial relapse and improve survival for patients with SCLC. The role of PCI in the treatment of both limited stage and extensive stage SCLC will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BRAIN METASTASIS IN SCLC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a significant rate of occult brain metastases even in patients who are diagnosed with SCLC (small cell lung cancer) but do not have neurologic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylactic-cranial-irradiation-for-patients-with-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and patients who have a good response of their other disease to initial treatment will often develop brain metastases as the sole site of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylactic-cranial-irradiation-for-patients-with-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has been extensively studied as a way to decrease the incidence of brain metastases following chemotherapy and to prevent the associated morbidity and mortality associated with brain metastases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Limited-stage SCLC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PCI both increases overall survival and decreases the incidence of brain metastases in patients who have responded to initial treatment for limited stage SCLC. The effectiveness of PCI in patients with limited stage SCLC has been established by the results from numerous clinical trials. </p><p>The value of PCI was established in a meta-analysis of seven randomized trials that included 987 patients who achieved a complete remission with chemotherapy and received PCI between 1977 and 1995 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylactic-cranial-irradiation-for-patients-with-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The incidence of brain metastases was significantly decreased with PCI (relative risk [RR] 0.46; 95% CI 0.38-0.57), and there was an absolute decrease in the three-year cumulative incidence of brain metastases (33 versus 59 percent). Furthermore, mortality was decreased with PCI (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.73-0.97), which corresponded to an increase in the three-year survival rate from 15.3 to 20.7 percent. In this meta-analysis, 12 percent of patients in the PCI group and 17 percent of patients in the control group had extensive stage disease. There were no differences in the relative risk of death or of brain metastases when the data were analyzed according to stage of disease.</p><p>A second meta-analysis that evaluated 1547 patients from 12 randomized trials reported almost identical findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylactic-cranial-irradiation-for-patients-with-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Extensive-stage SCLC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PCI decreases the incidence of symptomatic brain metastases in patients with extensive stage SCLC who have a response to systemic chemotherapy, although its effect on overall survival is uncertain. PCI in extensive stage SCLC has been studied in two randomized multicenter trials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a phase III trial conducted by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), all patients initially received four to six cycles of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylactic-cranial-irradiation-for-patients-with-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. At the completion of the initial chemotherapy, approximately 75 percent of patients had residual disease in the chest, and 70 percent had residual evidence of metastatic disease. Patients were not routinely imaged for the presence or absence of brain metastases after chemotherapy and prior to PCI. The primary objective of the study was the prevention of symptomatic brain metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Overall, 286 patients with a response to chemotherapy as judged by the treating clinician were randomly assigned to PCI or to observation without PCI. Radiation doses and schedules ranged from 20 Gy in five fractions to 30 Gy in 12 fractions, depending upon the institution.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients treated with PCI had a significantly decreased incidence of symptomatic brain metastases at one year (15 versus 40 percent without PCI, hazard ratio [HR] 0.27, 95% CI 0.16-0.44). The median overall survival was increased in patients treated with PCI (6.7 versus 5.4 months, measured from randomization), and the one-year survival rate was significantly increased (27 versus 13 percent, HR 0.68 95% CI 0.52-0.88). The risk of extracranial progression did not differ significantly between the two groups (89 versus 93 percent at one year).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a second trial that was conducted in Japan, 224 patients who had at least some response to their initial chemotherapy were randomly assigned to PCI or no PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylactic-cranial-irradiation-for-patients-with-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Prior to randomization, patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to rule out occult metastases. The treatment protocol required active surveillance with follow-up MRI at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months. Radiation therapy (RT) was given to a dose of 25 Gy in 10 fractions. The primary endpoint of this trial was overall survival. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of brain metastases and progression-free survival.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The trial was stopped prematurely for futility. Although not statistically significant, overall survival was shorter with PCI compared with no PCI (median 11.6 versus 13.7 months, HR 1.27, 95% CI 0.96-1.68). There was a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of brain metastases with PCI (33 versus 59 percent at one year).</p><p/><p>Treatment with PCI was generally well tolerated in both trials. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Toxicity'</a> below.)</p><p>The results of these trials provide strong evidence that PCI can decrease the incidence of symptomatic brain metastases. The impact of PCI on overall survival in patients with extensive stage SCLC who respond to chemotherapy remains uncertain. </p><p>The impact of PCI for patients with extensive-stage SCLC is uncertain, given the differences between these two trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylactic-cranial-irradiation-for-patients-with-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Our approach is to limit consideration of PCI to patients with extensive-stage SCLC who have a complete or very good partial response to their initial treatment and who have a good performance status. An individualized discussion should be held with such patients to evaluate the pros and cons of PCI versus observation. In patients not receiving PCI, regular MRI surveillance for metastases by brain imaging should be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIATION DOSE AND TIMING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Higher doses of radiation are associated with better control of brain metastases, although this benefit must be weighed against the risks of toxicity. For patients who achieve a complete response or near complete response to initial therapy, our approach is to use a total dose of 25 Gy in 2.5 Gy fractions; 30 Gy in 2 Gy fractions is also an acceptable regimen. More abbreviated courses of therapy are an option for patients with an incomplete response to initial chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Toxicity'</a> below.) </p><p>Indirect evidence supporting the efficacy of higher doses of radiation in reducing brain metastases comes from the initial meta-analysis that established the efficacy of PCI (prophylactic cranial irradiation), in which the dose of radiation was broken down into four categories (8 Gy, 24 to 25 Gy, 30 Gy, and 36 to 40 Gy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylactic-cranial-irradiation-for-patients-with-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A statistically significant trend for improved control of brain metastases was observed with increasing total doses of radiation. Similarly, a retrospective analysis of PCI doses demonstrated an approximately linear dose-response relationship for reduced brain metastases with increases in dose that ranged from 0 to 35 Gy in 2 Gy fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylactic-cranial-irradiation-for-patients-with-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The effect of radiation dose has been studied in two large randomized trials and neither demonstrated an advantage for doses above 25 Gy in 10 fractions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most extensive data on the impact of radiation dose come from a multinational phase III trial, in which 720 patients with limited stage (LS)-SCLC and a complete response to their initial treatment were randomly assigned to PCI at a dose of either 25 Gy in 10 fractions or a dose of 36 Gy (administered either as 18 fractions of 2 Gy each or 24 fractions of 1.5 Gy given twice-daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylactic-cranial-irradiation-for-patients-with-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Among the patients randomized to the 36 Gy treatment arm, 78 percent received once daily therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The two-year incidence rates of brain metastases were 23 percent for the higher radiation dose and 29 percent with the lower dose. This difference was not statistically significant (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.57-1.11). However, the higher dose was associated with a significantly lower two-year survival rate (37 versus 42 percent, HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.00-1.44). There was no obvious explanation for the increased mortality in the group treated with higher doses of PCI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The RTOG 0212 trial randomly assigned 265 patients with limited stage SCLC and a complete response after chemotherapy and thoracic RT to PCI with either 25 Gy in 10 fractions or 36 Gy. The 36 Gy cohort was secondarily randomized to receive their radiation either in 18 fractions of 2 Gy or 1.5 Gy twice daily in 24 fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylactic-cranial-irradiation-for-patients-with-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. At a median follow-up of 25 months, there was no significant difference in the incidence of brain metastases or overall survival between the treatment arms, but the study was not adequately powered to evaluate the impact of treatment on these parameters. This trial did provide important information regarding the long-term neurotoxicity of PCI. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Long-term toxicity'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>PCI is not given during chemotherapy to decrease the risk of leukoencephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylactic-cranial-irradiation-for-patients-with-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TOXICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cranial irradiation can be associated with both acute and long-term toxicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute toxicities associated with PCI include fatigue, alopecia, scalp erythema, and to a lesser extent, headaches and low-grade nausea, all of which are usually self-limited.

Potentially devastating neurologic and intellectual disabilities were seen with earlier treatment techniques that used concurrent chemotherapy, large fraction sizes (3.0 to 4.0 Gy), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a high total dose, all of which have been shown to be associated with severe late neurotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylactic-cranial-irradiation-for-patients-with-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Less devastating but significant impairment in cognitive functioning was also demonstrated in a CALGB study following simultaneous treatment with chemotherapy, thoracic radiation, and PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylactic-cranial-irradiation-for-patients-with-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>The likelihood of severe deficits appears to be minimal with modern techniques for PCI:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two early randomized trials that evaluated PCI included neurotoxicity as an outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylactic-cranial-irradiation-for-patients-with-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/4,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,18</a>]. In the first, patients underwent neuropsychological examination and computed tomography brain scans, which were repeated regularly during follow-up after randomization to either PCI or to no PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylactic-cranial-irradiation-for-patients-with-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. No significant differences were observed in neuropsychological function.

Although significant abnormalities were present prior to randomization, neither study demonstrated adverse effects attributable to PCI. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The RTOG 0212 trial randomly assigned 265 patients with limited stage SCLC and a complete response after chemotherapy and thoracic RT to PCI with either 25 Gy in 10 fractions or 36 Gy.

Detailed neurocognitive and quality of life assessments were carried out on the study population. Baseline assessment prior to PCI identified abnormalities in multiple parameters including language, visual and spatial scanning, attention, sequencing, and speed. Further neurologic impairment was observed at the 12 month assessment, but chronic neurotoxicity was significantly less frequent in patients treated with 25 Gy compared with 36 Gy (60 versus 85 and 89 percent, respectively, p = 0.02). </p><p/><p>As treatment for SCLC becomes more successful, the potential for long-term neurotoxicity due to PCI will be more relevant. Research efforts to minimize the neurotoxicity of PCI have included twice daily fractionation (1.5 Gy twice-daily to 30 to 36 Gy), hippocampal-sparing whole brain radiotherapy, and the use of alternative systemic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylactic-cranial-irradiation-for-patients-with-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

For patients with limited stage SCLC with evidence of significant tumor regression but less than a complete response at the completion of chemotherapy, we recommend PCI (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Meta-analyses have shown that this approach can prolong overall survival and decrease the incidence of subsequent brain metastases. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For good performance status patients with extensive-stage SCLC who have had a complete or very good partial response to their initial chemotherapy, both PCI and observation with regular brain magnetic&nbsp;resonance imaging (MRI)&nbsp;surveillance are acceptable options.
