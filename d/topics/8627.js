It is viewed as a syndrome that likely encompasses different disorders that have in common a reduction of CD4 cell numbers. Patients with ICL typically present with opportunistic infections, malignancies, or autoimmune disorders. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of ICL will be discussed in this topic review.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic CD4+ T cell lymphocytopenia (ICL) is defined by persistent CD4+ T cell lymphopenia in the absence of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 or any other cause of immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. CD4+ T cell counts should be below 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> or less than 20 percent of total lymphocytes on more than one occasion, usually two or three months apart. (See <a href=\"#H25097699\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25097358\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic CD4+ T cell lymphocytopenia (ICL) was first described in 1992, at the beginning of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic, following the recognition that acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was caused by HIV-1. A subset of patients suspected of having HIV because of profound CD4+ lymphopenia had no evidence of infection. Additional immunologic defects were present in a few of these patients, including CD8+ lymphocytopenia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> low immunoglobulin levels.</p><p>Some of these individuals also had risk factors for HIV infection. However, a thorough search for an etiologic agent in subsequent years has failed to yield a pathogen. The syndrome of ICL describes the immunologic findings in these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic CD4+ T cell lymphocytopenia (ICL) is a rare condition that is found worldwide and has no apparent gender predilection. Most of the ICL patients originally reported were adults, although the disease has subsequently been described in a small number of children and adolescents and also in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>].</p><p>In a review of 230,179 cases referred to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) AIDS Reporting System during the 1980s and early 1990s, 47 patients (0.02 percent) were diagnosed with ICL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients had been referred for evaluation of CD4+ lymphocytopenia or illnesses indicative of immunodeficiency. ICL is more prevalent among intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs, although no causative infectious agents have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Understanding of this disease is based on several studies describing significant numbers of patients with ICL:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 1992, a study was initiated at the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) to follow ICL patients prospectively and define the natural history of the disorder. The study ended in 2006 and reported on the outcomes of 39 of the 47 patients, which represents the largest United States series of patients with ICL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2013 review analyzed 258 cases that were described in 143 published papers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 2014, another large series was reported from France, in which 40 patients were followed for a mean of 6.9 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p>The findings from these studies are presented throughout this topic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic CD4+ T cell lymphocytopenia (ICL) is a disorder of unknown etiology and is viewed as a syndrome that likely encompasses different disorders that have in common the reduction of CD4 cell numbers. Because of the clinical similarities with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the search for an underlying viral cause was the focus of initial investigations. Subsequently, research has focused on identifying coexistent illnesses and other immunologic abnormalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Attempts to identify an infectious agent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An infectious etiology of ICL has not been identified thus far. ICL was initially investigated by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the early 1990s, as mentioned previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Among the 47 classified as having ICL, approximately 40 percent had engaged in high-risk sexual behavior or had a history of blood or blood product exposure. However, investigation of close contacts, sexual partners, children, blood donors, and recipients of the patients' blood did not demonstrate evidence of transmissibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. An extensive search for a viral etiology, utilizing serologic, culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, was negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Following the initial CDC report, a retrospective investigation of over 1200 HIV-seronegative drug users followed over eight years identified only four patients who fulfilled the CDC case definition of ICL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Screening blood donors by assessing CD4+ T cell numbers was suggested because of concerns that an unknown retrovirus was responsible for ICL. In a pilot study of approximately 2000 blood donors, 0.25 percent of HIV-seronegative individuals were found to have transient CD4-lymphocytopenia associated with temporary illnesses. No true cases of ICL were identified and CD4 cell count donor screening proved to be costly and ineffective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In 1995, an investigation of over 300 HIV-seronegative hemophiliac men and their female sexual partners demonstrated that 2.3 percent of patients (seven men) and one female partner met the ICL case definition, although three patients recovered spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The presence of hepatitis C antibodies was nearly universal in both sets of patients; however, those individuals with ICL were more likely to have a history of liver disease and splenomegaly, indicating that individuals with ICL were more likely to develop clinical disease following acquisition of hepatitis C.</p><p>Although no infectious agent has been identified as causative in ICL, the data are not entirely reassuring. One study demonstrated a cytopathic effect (CPE) of an ICL patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) co-cultured with a lymphoblastoid cell line, and identified A-type retroviral particles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In this same study, sera from 8 of 13 ICL patients reacted by Western immunoblotting with these retroviral particles, while control sera remained negative. However, these results were not duplicated in subsequent studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Functions of CD4 T cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CD4 is a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of various types of helper and regulatory T cells. It is essential for the interaction of T cells with other cells expressing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, such as B cells and monocytes. The <span class=\"nowrap\">CD4/MHC</span> II interaction is a critical costimulatory event in the response of these T cells to antigen. The other required stimulus is the interaction of the T cell receptor and antigen. The cytoplasmic domain of CD4 is associated with the protein tyrosine kinase Lck, a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Binding of the T cell receptor to antigen <strong>without</strong> the costimulatory input of <span class=\"nowrap\">CD4/MHC</span> II leads to a state of anergy (unresponsiveness or refractoriness to activation) and possibly even to deletion by apoptosis (programmed cell death). This may be an important mechanism in T cell tolerance. Certain subpopulations of CD4+ T cells are also believed to be important in tumor surveillance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of CD4 cell loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is evidence for increased activation and turnover of CD4+ cells in patients with ICL, as well as accelerated CD4+ cell apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/11,12,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,18</a>]. It is unclear if these observations are directly involved in etiology or merely represent the effect of CD4 depletion. Thymic function is well-preserved as evidence of normal or increased numbers of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), a measure of newly formed T cells from the thymus gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased activation may be the result of stimulation by an unidentified pathogen, either transiently with impaired homeostatic mechanisms or persistently, resulting in a lasting decrease in the numbers of CD4+ lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. One study found increased levels of serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and markers of CD4+ lymphocyte activation in patients with ICL and hypothesized that abnormally increased microbial translocation through the intestinal wall (&quot;leaky gut&quot;) may be an underlying etiology, although it is not known if the gut mucosa in ICL is also lymphopenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study evaluated whether T cell numbers were decreased at effector sites by comparing <span class=\"nowrap\">rectal/sigmoid</span> mucosal biopsies from patients with ICL and healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Significant T cell lymphopenia was observed in the mucosal tissue of patients with ICL by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry compared with healthy controls. However, functional capacity of the T cells, assessed by production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-17 (IL-17), was preserved in the mucosa of patients with ICL. In addition, the frequency of myeloid cells (neutrophils and macrophages) was elevated in the colonic mucosa of patients with ICL. Data from this study suggest that patients with ICL, despite gut mucosal lymphopenia and local tissue inflammation, have preserved enterocyte turnover and T helper type 17 cells with minimal systemic inflammation, which is quite a distinct finding from patients who have HIV infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apoptosis may be associated with enhanced expression of Fas and Fas ligand. One study demonstrated that a patient with ICL and disseminated <em>Mycobacterium xenopi</em> infection had overexpression of <span class=\"nowrap\">Fas/CD95c</span> and spontaneous and Fas-induced apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patients with stable, physiologic, CD4 cell lymphopenia without opportunistic infections, however, did not demonstrate accelerated apoptosis, suggesting that infection may be a necessary initial stimulus for this phenomenon.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Other immunologic abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heterogeneous immune defects have been identified in patients with ICL. However, no unifying theory of pathogenesis to connect these findings has been proposed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One area of research suggests that the pathogenesis of ICL involves the premature aging of CD4+T cells. In one study of 20 patients with ICL, the function of CD4+T cells was found to resemble that of cells from normal older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The cells demonstrated increased expression of dual-specific phosphatase 4 (DUSP4), a signaling molecule that can be induced by recurrent stimulation through the T cell receptor (TCR). When DUSP4 expression was normalized using a knockdown approach, TCR signaling was partially restored. The cause of recurrent stimulation in this patient population remains unclear, although exposure to an unidentified infectious agent (which was not detected in this study) and an intrinsic cellular defect are both possible explanations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients have low CD8+ T cells. In the series of 39 patients described above, patients with CD8 counts &lt;180 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup></span> were found to have a higher risk of serious opportunistic infections and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This subgroup of patients may represent a more severe variant of ICL. The complete absence of specific CD8+ cells (CD8+28+) has been reported in a small number of patients with ICL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients have low B cell numbers or even a complete absence of B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/11,13,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13,23</a>]. ICL has been associated with increases in immature or transitional B cells and increased serum levels of interleukin-7 (IL-7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients may have low natural killer (NK) cells as well, and counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;100/mm<sup>3</sup></span> were associated with mortality in the French cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Defective expression of CXCR4 (which binds the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1) on the surface of CD4 cells was demonstrated in a small series of six patients with ICL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The interaction of the <span class=\"nowrap\">receptor/ligand</span> pair is critical for multiple aspects of normal T cell differentiation and trafficking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha/beta</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">gamma/delta</span> T cell repertoires of ICL patients are highly restricted, suggesting a problem in differentiation or maturation during T cell development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biochemical defects of the TCR transduction pathway have been demonstrated, possibly due to an abnormality of tyrosine kinase activity of p56 (Lck) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Defects in this kinase appear to impact CD4 cell function and maintenance of adequate numbers of cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Findings in one child with ICL suggested dysfunctional thymic T cell maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Expression of CD45RA (a marker for na&iuml;ve T cells) was reduced, coupled with enhanced CD45RO (marker for memory T cells) expression and an increase in <span class=\"nowrap\">gamma/delta</span> TCR-bearing T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Accelerated apoptosis was noted only in the CD45RO+ T cell subsets.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some studies suggest that ICL may be due to decreased bone marrow clonogenic capability or the inability of bone marrow stem cells to mature successfully [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Other studies highlight a likely association with perturbation of interleukin-2 (IL-2) function, as cytokines, especially IL-2, emerged as one of the main possible mechanisms involved in the clinical and pathologic behavior of ICL. One therapeutic approach in controlling life-threatening infections and underlying disorders along with efforts to cure ICL by increasing CD4&#8314; cell counts use cytokine interventions and transplantation, as outlined below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Therapies to increase CD4 cell counts'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ICL has been associated anecdotally with inflammatory conditions such as immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) multi-organ disease, a fibro-inflammatory condition characterized by tumefactive lesions, a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate rich in IgG4-positive plasma cells, storiform fibrosis, and, often, elevated serum levels of IgG4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]; associations with systemic lupus erythematosus have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], as well as other autoimmune conditions.

This is seen in bacterial sepsis, measles, and other serious infections. Alternative diagnoses would be suggested by the clinical presentation and comorbidities. There are few diseases, however, that exclusively affect CD4+ T cell subsets in isolation. Tests to exclude these infections were reviewed previously.

It is most commonly identified in adults, although it can affect children. There is no apparent gender predilection. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiology or etiologies of ICL are unknown. The mechanism of CD4 cell loss in ICL appears to be due to increased activation and turnover <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> accelerated CD4+ cell apoptosis (programmed cell death) in patients with advanced immune suppression and opportunistic infections. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations range from an isolated laboratory finding without clinical illness to life-threatening opportunistic infections. Most patients develop infections, malignancies, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> autoimmune disorders. Clinical manifestations depend on the duration and degree of immune suppression. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ICL is a diagnosis of exclusion. CD4+ T cell counts should be confirmed to be low on at least two occasions separated by at least six weeks. HIV infection, congenital immunodeficiencies, malignancies, and exogenous causes of immune dysfunction must be excluded. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25097699\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis is variable and depends largely on the severity of the clinical presentation, with most severe infections occurring at diagnosis or soon thereafter. In most patients, CD4 values remain stable rather than progressing to the very low levels seen in untreated HIV infection. Concomitant CD8+ lymphocytopenia confers an increased risk of opportunistic infections and lower CD4 (&lt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span> and low natural killer (NK) cell counts may be a predictor of mortality. (See <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of ICL should be directed at treatment of associated conditions. There are no formal guidelines for treatment or monitoring.

(See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Prophylaxis against infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with CD4 counts that are persistently very low (eg, &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cell/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span> and who suffer from recalcitrant or recurrent infections that cannot be prevented or treated by other means, we suggest experimental therapies to increase CD4 counts (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been used in this setting, although it should be administered in the setting of an investigational protocol because of potentially severe adverse effects.
