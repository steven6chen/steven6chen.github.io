Sympathetic paragangliomas usually secrete catecholamines and are located in the sympathetic paravertebral ganglia of thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. In contrast, most parasympathetic paragangliomas are nonfunctional and located along the glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves in the neck and at the base of the skull. Catecholamine-secreting paragangliomas often present clinically like pheochromocytomas with hypertension, episodic headache, sweating, and tachycardia. However, the distinction between pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma is an important one because of implications for associated neoplasms, risk for malignancy, and genetic testing.</p><p>Even with modern genetic testing, the majority of paragangliomas appear to be sporadic. However, approximately one-third to one-half (in recent series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>] are associated with an inherited syndrome. Some hereditary paragangliomas, particularly those arising in the head and neck, have been linked to mutations in the genes encoding different subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme complex. In addition, susceptibility to pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas is an established component of four genetic syndromes, multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2A and 2B (MEN2), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), von Hippel Lindau (VHL), and Carney-Stratakis dyad.</p><p>This topic review will cover the epidemiology, risk factors, molecular pathogenesis, histology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and genetic screening issues of paragangliomas arising at a variety of sites in the body. Treatment of paragangliomas, and the genetics, clinical presentation, and treatment of pheochromocytomas are covered elsewhere.

An adrenal catecholamine-secreting tumor is widely referred to as &quot;pheochromocytoma,&quot; although the 2004 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of endocrine organs designated these tumors as &quot;intraadrenal paragangliomas&quot; rather than pheochromocytomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some authors use the term &ldquo;extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma&rdquo; to describe a catecholamine-secreting tumor that arises from sympathetic paraganglia outside of the adrenal gland. Others use the collective term pheochromocytoma to describe all tumors arising in the paraganglia of the abdomen (both adrenal and extra-adrenal) and thorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, the 2004 WHO classification used the term &ldquo;extra-adrenal paraganglioma&rdquo; to denote an extra-adrenal tumor of sympathetic or parasympathetic paraganglia origin, regardless of secretory status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For the purpose of this review, the term paraganglioma will be used to designate both functioning (catecholamine-secreting) and nonfunctioning tumors arising in the paraganglia outside of the adrenal gland, with the term pheochromocytoma limited to those tumors that arise in the adrenal glands.</p><p>Paragangliomas can derive from either parasympathetic or sympathetic paraganglia; the two types occur with similar frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although indistinguishable at the cellular level, parasympathetic and sympathetic paragangliomas differ in their anatomic distribution and frequency of an underlying genetic syndrome; they also have distinct clinical features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of parasympathetic ganglia-derived paragangliomas are located in the neck and skull base along the branches of the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F86407\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86407 \">figure 2</a>). They arise most commonly from the carotid body, less commonly from jugulotympanic and vagal paraganglia, and rarely, from the laryngeal paraganglia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The terminology of these tumors has evolved. They are sometimes referred to as non-chromaffin paragangliomas in distinction to metameric (chromaffin) paragangliomas, which arise from chromaffin cells found in the sympathetic paraganglia and the adrenal medulla (see below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">All were previously referred to as chemodectomas. However, this is a misnomer, since only the carotid body paraganglia act as chemoreceptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]; this term should no longer be used. Older terms for tumors of the jugular paraganglia (glomus jugulare) and the tympanic paraganglia (glomus tympanicum) should also no longer be used; the term jugulotympanic paraganglioma is preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Approximately 75 percent of sympathetic paragangliomas arise in the abdomen, most often at the junction of the vena cava and the left renal vein, or at the organ of Zuckerkandl, which resides at the aortic bifurcation near the take-off of the inferior mesenteric artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F86631\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86631 \">image 2</a>).

Approximately 25 percent are part of a genetic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p/><p>In familial paraganglioma syndromes, paragangliomas can have multiple sites of anatomic origin and can occur with synchronous multiplicity, metachronous multiplicity, or both.

Paragangliomas are closely related to pheochromocytomas, many secrete catecholamines, and can cause clinical symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H2199768168\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paragangliomas can derive from either parasympathetic or sympathetic ganglia, and the clinical features vary by this type of origin (see <a href=\"#H14161508\" class=\"local\">'Definition and anatomic origin'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Parasympathetic ganglia-derived paragangliomas are located almost exclusively in the neck and skull base, arising most often from the carotid body and jugulotympanic paraganglia. They are non-functional.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sympathetic paragangliomas arise outside of the adrenal gland anywhere along the sympathetic chain from the base of the skull (5 percent) to the bladder; most secrete catecholamines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 30 percent of all paragangliomas are hereditary and associated with paraganglioma syndromes. The paraganglioma syndromes 1, 3, and 4 (PGL1, 3, 4) make up the majority of familial cases. The most common types are PGL1, which is associated with mutations of the succinate dehydrogenase subunit D (<em>SDHD</em>) gene, and PGL4, which is caused by SDH subunit B (<em>SDHB</em>) mutations. Other autosomal dominant hereditary syndromes that include <span class=\"nowrap\">pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma</span> include multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2A and 2B (MEN2), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and von Hippel Lindau (VHL) (see <a href=\"#H2199768288\" class=\"local\">'Hereditary syndromes'</a> above). Multiple paragangliomas (either synchronous or metachronous) are present in 17 to 85 percent of hereditary <span class=\"nowrap\">pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma</span> patients, compared to only 1.2 percent of sporadic cases. (See <a href=\"#H14858648\" class=\"local\">'Features suggestive of inherited versus sporadic paraganglioma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although most paragangliomas are benign, those associated with <em>SDHB</em> mutations and some types of VHL are more likely to be malignant. There are no consistent histologic signs of malignant behavior; the only reliable indicator is the development of metastases. (See <a href=\"#H3767941\" class=\"local\">'Histology and malignant potential'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14164853\" class=\"local\">'Familial paraganglioma and SDH gene mutations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of paraganglioma is highly variable. Patients can be symptomatic from excessive catecholamine secretion with episodic hypertension, tachycardia, palpitations, sweating, pallor, headache, or nonspecific abdominal or flank pain. Patients with a skull base and neck paraganglioma typically present with a painless neck mass (carotid body tumor), or pulsatile tinnitus with or without conductive hearing loss (jugulotympanic paraganglioma). Other patients can be asymptomatic with a tumor diagnosed incidentally on computed tomography (CT), or are diagnosed because they have been identified as a carrier of a disease-conferring germline mutation. (See <a href=\"#H2268278693\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When an <em>SDHx</em> mutation is identified in a relative of a proband, screening biochemical and imaging studies are indicated. Prospective studies to guide the clinician in the frequency and type of testing are lacking. Our recommended approach is outlined above. (See <a href=\"#H6603186\" class=\"local\">'Mutation carriers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of a secretory paraganglioma can usually be made by measurements of urinary <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> plasma fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F81154\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81154 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H60675447\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Biochemical testing is indicated for all patients with a paraganglioma, even if they present without symptoms of catecholamine excess.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For catecholamine-secreting tumors, biochemical diagnosis should be followed by radiological evaluation (typically either CT or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] of the abdomen and pelvis) to locate the tumor. If abdominal and pelvic CT or MRI is negative, the next step is cross-sectional imaging of the <span class=\"nowrap\">thorax/head</span> and neck <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radioisotope (functional) imaging using 18-F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) or 123[I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG). (See <a href=\"#H60675576\" class=\"local\">'Localizing the tumor'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of a non-secretory paraganglioma or a paraganglioma in an unusual location, for which biochemical testing may not have been done due to lack of clinical suspicion, is usually based on characteristic radiographic findings. For suspected paragangliomas below the neck, cross sectional imaging with either CT or MRI is an acceptable initial test. For skull base and neck paragangliomas, the initial test may be an ultrasound, CT, or MRI (see <a href=\"#H15699100\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ultrasound is a good initial diagnostic study for patients with a suspected carotid body paraganglioma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Both MRI and CT are typically needed for a suspected jugulotympanic paraganglioma given that the information derived from each study is complementary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At some institutions, all patients with a paraganglioma undergo MIBG scanning to screen for metachronous tumors. Others prefer 111-In pentetreotide (Octreoscan). (See <a href=\"#H60675620\" class=\"local\">'Radioisotope imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">FDG-PET/CT</span> scanning is more sensitive than MIBG for detecting metastatic disease, and is preferred for screening for and following metastatic disease. Screening for metastatic disease is indicated in all patients with a <em>SDHB</em> germline mutation-related paraganglioma and all dopamine-secreting paragangliomas because of the high frequency of metastases. (See <a href=\"#H60675620\" class=\"local\">'Radioisotope imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H60675296\" class=\"local\">'Catecholamine hypersecretion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening for germline mutations in <em>SDH</em> and other genes should be carried out in all patients with paraganglioma. Our approach to genetic testing is outlined in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F86406\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef86406 \">algorithm 2</a>).
