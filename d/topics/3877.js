The infection is characterized by fever, malaise, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, followed by exanthem. Following exposure, approximately 90 percent of susceptible individuals will develop measles. The period of contagiousness is estimated to be from five days before the appearance of the rash to four days afterward. The illness may be transmitted in public spaces, even in the absence of person-to-person contact.</p><p>Measles virus infection can cause a variety of clinical syndromes, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classic measles infection in immunocompetent patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modified measles infection in patients with preexisting but incompletely protective anti-measles antibody</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical measles infection in patients immunized with the killed virus vaccine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic syndromes following measles infection, including acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe measles infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of measles including secondary infection, giant cell pneumonia, and measles inclusion body encephalitis</p><p/><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of measles will be reviewed here. Issues related to epidemiology, transmission, and prevention of measles virus infection are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measles-epidemiology-and-transmission\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measles: Epidemiology and transmission&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measles-mumps-and-rubella-immunization-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measles, mumps, and rubella immunization in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measles-mumps-and-rubella-immunization-in-infants-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measles, mumps, and rubella immunization in infants, children, and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Stages of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classic measles virus infection can be subdivided into the following clinical stages: incubation, prodrome, exanthem, and recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incubation period &ndash; The incubation period for measles is 6 to 21 days (median 13 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]; it begins after virus entry via the respiratory mucosa or conjunctivae. The virus replicates locally, spreads to regional lymphatic tissues, and is then thought to disseminate to other reticuloendothelial sites via the bloodstream, which is considered the first viremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The period of contagiousness is estimated to be from five days before the appearance of rash to four days afterward. Infected individuals are characteristically asymptomatic during the incubation period, although some have been reported to experience transient respiratory symptoms, fever, or rash [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The dissemination of measles virus due to viremia, with associated infection of endothelial, epithelial, monocyte, and macrophage cells, may explain the variety of clinical manifestations and complications that can occur with measles virus infection. A second viremia occurs several days after the first, coinciding with the appearance of symptoms signaling the beginning of the prodromal phase.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prodrome &ndash; The prodrome usually lasts for two to four days but may persist for as long as eight days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]; it is defined by the appearance of symptoms that typically include fever, malaise, and anorexia, followed by conjunctivitis, coryza, and cough. The severity of conjunctivitis is variable and may also be accompanied by lacrimation or photophobia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The respiratory symptoms result from mucosal inflammation from viral infection of epithelial cells. Fever is typically present. Various fever patterns have been described, and fever as high as 40&ordm;C can occur. The prodromal symptoms typically intensify a few days before the exanthem appears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Enanthem &ndash; Approximately 48 hours prior to onset of the exanthem, patients may develop an enanthem characterized by Koplik's spots; these are 1 to 3 mm whitish, grayish, or bluish elevations with an erythematous base, typically seen on the buccal mucosa opposite the molar teeth, though they can spread to cover the buccal and labial mucosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57571\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57571 \">picture 1</a>) as well as the hard and soft palate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. They have been described as &quot;grains of salt on a red background&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Koplik's spots may coalesce and generally last 12 to 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Koplik's spots often begin to slough when the exanthem appears.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">It is important to search carefully for Koplik's spots in patients with suspected measles, since they can improve the accuracy of clinical diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, this enanthem does not appear in all patients with measles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exanthem &ndash; The exanthem of measles arises approximately two to four days after onset of fever; it consists of an erythematous, maculopapular, blanching rash, which classically begins on the face and spreads cephalocaudally and centrifugally to involve the neck, upper trunk, lower trunk, and extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57093%7EID%2F57803\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57093 graphicRef57803 \">picture 2A-B</a>). Early on, the lesions are blanching; in the later stages, they are not (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57803\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57803 \">picture 2B</a>). The rash may include petechiae; in severe cases, it may appear hemorrhagic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. In children, the extent of the rash and degree of confluence generally correlate with the severity of the illness. The palms and soles are rarely involved. The cranial to caudal progression of the rash is characteristic of measles but is not pathognomonic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other characteristic findings during the exanthematous phase include lymphadenopathy, high fever (peaking two to three days after appearance of rash), pronounced respiratory signs including pharyngitis, and nonpurulent conjunctivitis. Uncommonly, patients with severe measles develop generalized lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Clinical improvement typically ensues within 48 hours of the appearance of the rash. After three to four days, the rash darkens to a brownish color (in patients of Caucasian descent though not patients of African descent) and begins to fade, followed by fine desquamation in the more severely involved areas. The rash usually lasts six to seven days and fades in the order it appeared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recovery and immunity &ndash; Cough may persist for one to two weeks after measles. The occurrence of fever beyond the third to fourth day of rash suggests a measles-associated complication (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Both humoral and cellular measles-specific immunity are important for viral clearance and lasting protective immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Children with defects in humoral immunity, such as agammaglobulinemia, generally recover from measles, while individuals with T cell deficiencies often have severe measles infection and high mortality rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Immunity after measles virus infection is thought to be lifelong, although there are rare reports of measles reinfection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. A measles surveillance program conducted in the mid-1960s, for example, identified measles in a 16-year-old female with a prior history of measles at age 8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A rise in anti-measles immunoglobulin (Ig)G but not IgM was observed in this individual, suggesting an anamnestic response. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Modified measles'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Measles virus infection can cause transient suppression of T cell responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. After measles virus infection, delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to recall antigens such as tuberculin are suppressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and cellular and humoral responses to new antigens are restricted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Measles virus&ndash;induced immunosuppression may lead to secondary bacterial and viral illnesses including pneumonia and diarrhea, which cause the majority of measles-related morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In addition, tuberculosis reactivation in the setting of recent measles infection has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/9,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H367342723\" class=\"local\">'Secondary infection'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical variants</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Modified measles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Modified measles is an attenuated infection that occurs in patients with preexisting measles immunity (either via wild-type disease or vaccination). It is similar to classic measles except the clinical manifestations are generally milder and the incubation period is longer (17 to 21 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Individuals with modified measles are not highly contagious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>Individuals with nonprotective immunity to measles can develop modified measles; nonprotective immunity may occur in one of the following ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transplacental transfer of anti-measles antibody from mother to infant. This antibody is generally cleared by three to nine months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]; clearance is earlier among infants born to vaccinated women than infants born to women with history of natural infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. When antibody titers reach levels that are not considered protective, the infant is at risk for measles infection, but low antibody levels may prevent severe disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Receipt of intravenous immunoglobulin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measles vaccination resulting in antibody titers lower than those considered seroprotective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior history of measles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Stages of infection'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Atypical measles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atypical measles refers to measles virus infection among patients immunized with the killed virus vaccine, which was used in the United States between 1963 and 1967; atypical measles is now rare. The killed virus vaccine sensitized the recipient to measles virus antigens without providing full protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Patients with atypical measles develop high fever and headache 7 to 14 days after exposure to measles. Atypical measles is characterized by higher and more prolonged fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A maculopapular rash develops two to three days later, beginning on the extremities (instead of the head as seen with typical measles) and spreading to the trunk. The rash may involve the palms and soles and tends to spare the upper chest, neck, and head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The rash may be vesicular, petechial, purpuric, or urticarial; it may have a hemorrhagic component. The distribution and varied appearance of the rash can make diagnosis difficult.</p><p>A dry cough and pleuritic chest pain are often present; pneumonitis can be severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Chest radiograph typically demonstrates bilateral pulmonary nodules and hilar lymphadenopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Atypical measles often results in severe illness; many patients develop respiratory distress. Some patients develop peripheral edema, hepatosplenomegaly, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurologic symptoms such as paresthesias or hyperesthesias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Laboratory findings can include elevated serum aminotransferases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Atypical measles is associated with a characteristic antibody pattern: before or at the onset of the exanthem, the titer is usually &lt;1:5 but, by day 10 of illness, the titer is typically &ge;1:1280. The height and rapidity of antibody titer rise is much higher than in primary natural measles infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of atypical measles is not entirely understood. Studies in macaques have shown that the formalin-inactivated measles vaccine induces low avidity, short-lived antibodies against the hemagglutinin protein but not the fusion protein, allowing cell-to-cell viral spread with no cytotoxic T cell immunity. Upon exposure to wild-type measles, the poorly neutralizing antibodies form complexes with the measles antigen, resulting in immune complex deposition, vasculitis, and pneumonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Patients with atypical measles do not appear to transmit measles virus to others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis of atypical measles is broad.

The infection is characterized by fever, malaise, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, followed by exanthem. Following exposure, approximately 90 percent of susceptible individuals will develop measles. The period of contagiousness is estimated to be from five days before the appearance of the rash to four days afterward. The illness may be transmitted in public spaces, even in the absence of person-to-person contact. Patients being evaluated for measles should be isolated. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classic measles infection in immunocompetent patients consists of the following clinical stages: incubation, prodrome, exanthem, and recovery. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Stages of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Incubation &ndash; The incubation is 6 to 21 days (median 13 days).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prodrome &ndash; A two- to four-day prodrome phase is characterized by fever, malaise, and anorexia, followed by conjunctivitis, coryza, and cough. If present, Koplik's spots (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57571\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57571 \">picture 1</a>), an enanthem considered pathognomonic for measles infection, typically occurs approximately 48 hours prior to the exanthem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Exanthem &ndash; The characteristic exanthem arises approximately two to four day after onset of fever; it consists of a red maculopapular rash, which classically begins on the face and head and spreads downward (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57093%7EID%2F57803\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57093 graphicRef57803 \">picture 2A-B</a>). Early on, the lesions are blanching; in later stages, they are not. The rash resolves in five to six days, fading in the order it appeared.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Recovery &ndash; Cough may persist for one two weeks after measles. The occurrence of fever beyond the third to fourth day of rash suggests a measles-associated complication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical variants include modified measles and atypical measles. Modified measles occurs in patients with preexisting but incompletely protective anti-measles antibody. Atypical measles occurs in patients immunized with the killed virus vaccine administered between 1963 and 1967 in the United States who are subsequently exposed to wild-type measles virus. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical variants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of measles should be considered in a patient presenting with a febrile rash illness and clinically compatible symptoms. The approach to diagnosis differs depending on the regional prevalence of measles. (See <a href=\"#H69935375\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In regions of low measles prevalence, cases of suspected or confirmed measles should be reported to the local health authorities, who provide guidance on specimen collection for diagnosis as well as infection control interventions. In general, it is useful to obtain three samples from patients with suspected measles infection: a serum sample for measles IgM, a throat or nasopharyngeal swab for viral culture, and a urine sample for viral culture. In the setting of diagnostic uncertainty, the diagnosis may be confirmed by evaluation of paired acute and convalescent sera for anti-measles virus IgG; at least fourfold increase in anti-measles antibody titer is indicative of infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In countries with high measles prevalence, the World Health Organization uses serum IgM as the standard test to confirm the diagnosis of measles. However, the anti-measles IgM assay should be interpreted with caution as false-positive and false-negative results have been reported.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of measles include secondary infections such as diarrhea and pneumonia. Complications of measles among immunocompromised individuals include giant cell pneumonia and measles inclusion body encephalitis. Groups at increased risk for complications of measles include immunocompromised hosts, pregnant women, individuals with vitamin A deficiency or poor nutritional status, and individuals at the extremes of age. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Groups at risk for complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic syndromes following measles virus infection include acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). ADEM is a demyelinating disease that presents during the recovery phase of measles infection and is thought to be caused by a postinfectious autoimmune response. SSPE is a progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system that generally occurs 7 to 10 years after natural measles infection; its pathogenesis may involve persistent infection with a genetic variant of measles virus within the central nervous system. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of measles is largely supportive. Supportive therapy includes antipyretics, fluids, and treatment of bacterial superinfections and other complications. (See <a href=\"#H2086563653\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin A may be beneficial in the setting of measles infection; data are limited. We suggest administering vitamin A to children with acute measles; even in countries where measles is not usually severe, vitamin A should be given to all cases of severe measles. (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
