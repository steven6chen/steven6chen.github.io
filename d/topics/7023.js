As is the case for many geriatric syndromes, falls usually occur when impairments in multiple domains compromise the compensatory ability of the individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Falls often go without clinical attention for a variety of reasons: the patient never mentions the event to a health care provider; there is no injury at the time of the fall; the provider fails to ask the patient about a history of falls; or either provider or patient erroneously believes that falls are an inevitable part of the aging process. Often, treatment of injuries resulting from a fall does not include investigation of the cause of the fall.</p><p>Significant morbidity and mortality may result from falls in older individuals. The importance of preventing falls is emphasized by a study that found that 80 percent of older women preferred death to a &quot;bad&quot; hip fracture that would result in nursing home admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>A number of the physical conditions and environmental situations that predispose to falls are modifiable. Clinicians caring for older patients need to routinely inquire about falls, assess for fall risk, and address modifiable underlying risk factors.</p><p>This topic focuses on strategies to prevent falls in older persons. A discussion of risks for falls and evaluation of patients who have had falls is presented separately, as is a discussion of fall prevention in nursing facility and hospital environments. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls in older persons: Risk factors and patient evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls: Prevention in nursing care facilities and the hospital setting&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTING FALLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple preventive intervention studies have been conducted, including educational programs and interventions to improve strength or balance, optimize medications, and modify environmental factors in homes or institutions. Some interventions have targeted a single risk factor, while others have attempted to address multiple factors. In general, evidence suggests that interventions individually tailored to target risk factors and impairments are more effective than those applied as a standard package [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In reviewing the studies of fall prevention, many trials use the number of fallers in active versus placebo groups, whereas other studies use the rate of falls in the active versus placebo groups. Since individuals who sustain multiple falls have a different risk profile than individuals who sustain a single fall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], it seems more relevant to clinical practice to favor those studies that examined fall rates as the outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 2012 systematic review evaluated 159 randomized trials of interventions to reduce the incidence of falling and involved 79,193 older persons living in the community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. An earlier review, prepared to support recommendations for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), evaluated 54 randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Significant heterogeneity among trials is noted, with differences in populations recruited for study, interventions and intervention intensity, and outcomes measured (rate of falls, number of fallers, or time to subsequent fall). There was no robust evidence regarding the optimum duration or intensity of interventions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise is one of the most consistently positive interventions to reduce the risk of falls and injurious falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. Thus, the initiation of exercise in older persons who do not exercise and continuing exercise in those who do exercise would be expected to be beneficial. For individuals with a history of falling, we suggest an exercise program combining several categories of exercise for muscle strengthening and balance as a part of a multidisciplinary program (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69682\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69682 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Exercise interventions can be provided in a group or home-based setting. The variety of effective types of exercise provides options for older persons, depending on their abilities and preferences. Exercises that emphasize balance training with resistance training, are integrative like tai chi (incorporating elements of balance, strength, and movement), and are progressive in their intensity are most effective. Exercise programs that involve at least three hours per week are associated with the greatest effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The following types of exercise have been shown to be effective in decreasing the risk of falls in randomized trials and systematic reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gait and balance training</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strength training</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Movement (such as tai chi or dance)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aerobic</p><p/><p>A number of meta-analyses of randomized trials have shown that exercise decreases the risk of falls and the rate of falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. The largest meta-analysis that evaluated exercise as a single intervention examined 61 trials involving 15,773 community-dwelling older adults; it found that exercise decreased the rate of falls by 21 percent (rate ratio [RaR] 0.79, 95% CI 0.53-0.72) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>A variety of exercise interventions have been shown to reduce falls. Examples of effective interventions include integration of balance and strength training into everyday home activities (functional exercise) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], step training (training individuals how to take correct, rapid, and well-directed steps to avoid falls) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and addition of a virtual reality component with simulated obstacles and distractors to treadmill training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In the absence of clear evidence about which particular interventions are most effective for fall prevention, choices can be guided by clinician and patient preferences as well as the availability of specific programs.</p><p>Tai chi, which contains elements of strength and balance training, was effective in several trials and systematic reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/6,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14-17</a>], In a meta-analysis of 10 trials in seniors who were at risk for falls, tai chi reduced the rate of falls and injurious falls at 12 months by approximately 43 and 50 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Tai chi may be less effective in frail older adults at high risk for falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>However, exercise may not prevent falls in all populations. In the LIFE Study, a large randomized trial of exercise to improve physical performance but not powered to address effects on falls per se, 1635 sedentary adults aged 70 to 89 years who had physical performance impairment but who were able to walk 400 m were randomly assigned to a moderate-intensity physical activity program (involving aerobic, strength, flexibility, and balance training) or a health education program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. There was no difference in serious fall injuries (hazard ratio [HR] 0.90; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.23), assessed every six months for up to 42 months, between the intervention and control groups overall. There was a reduction in the rate of such injuries in men, who comprised only one-third of the study sample.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Medication modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One placebo-controlled trial found that gradual withdrawal of psychotropic medications reduced the rate of falls (RaR 0.34, 95% CI 0.16-0.73) but not the risk of falling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Risk of falling was decreased (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.41-0.91) in one trial that evaluated medication review combined with multiple other physician-focused interventions (academic detailing, provider feedback on prescriptions, and financial reward) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, there is no evidence that medication assessment and withdrawal in the absence of other management interventions will reduce the risk of falling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Vitamin D supplementation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A systematic review has found that vitamin D may reduce fall risk in persons over age 65 with low serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D, though not in the older population overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although the evidence is not definitive, we suggest that older patients be given cholecalciferol (vitamin D<sub>3</sub>) supplements for fall prevention, which can be given daily, weekly, or monthly with the dose adjusted to achieve the equivalence of 800 to 1000 international units daily, in agreement with guidelines from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] and the USPSTF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/7,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,23</a>]. 2014 guidelines from the American Geriatrics Society for fall prevention recommend at least 1000 international units of vitamin D daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Authors of other UpToDate topics recommend a supplemental vitamin D dose of 600 to 800 international units for older adults. Higher doses of vitamin D supplements administered at less frequent intervals may increase the risk of falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], and the safest approach to vitamin D supplementation is to use daily dosing of smaller amounts.</p><p>Supplementation to prevent osteoporosis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcium and vitamin D supplementation in osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Vitamin D'</a>.)</p><p>Men and women over age 65 years with low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (&lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [25 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> are at greater risk for loss of muscle mass, strength, and hip fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Vitamin D supplementation may improve bone mineral density and muscle function. However, the effect of vitamin D on risk of falls remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/7,26,30-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,26,30-37</a>]. Results of meta-analyses and randomized trials have been discordant, possibly related to different inclusion criteria, different baseline vitamin D levels, and different dosing schedules for vitamin D.</p><p>Several meta-analyses of vitamin D supplementation in older adults showed a benefit of vitamin D in reducing risk of falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/7,36,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,36,38</a>]. A 2010 meta-analysis of nine trials concluded that vitamin D supplementation reduced falling (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.77-0.89) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, a 2012 meta-analysis of trials of interventions to prevent falls found that vitamin D supplementation in community-dwelling adults did not reduce risk of falling (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89-1.03, 13 trials) or the rate of falls (rate ratio 1.00, seven trials), but may have had some effect in people with lower pretreatment vitamin D levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The 2012 meta-analysis included a large trial (n = 2256) that used very high-dose vitamin D (single annual dose of 500,000 international units) and showed an increase in risk of falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], as well as two large null studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>], which were excluded from the 2010 meta-analysis because of poor quality.</p><p>Two randomized trials performed subsequent to these meta-analyses found no reduction in risk of falls with vitamin D supplementation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One trial in older women at high risk of falling compared placebo and 800 international units per day of vitamin D supplementation for two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The mean baseline 25(OH) D level of the trial participants was 26 to 28 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> above what is generally considered to be deficient, suggesting that pretreatment levels of vitamin D may influence its effectiveness in fall prevention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second trial compared monthly high-dose vitamin D (60,000 international units vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in one group; 24,000 international units vitamin D<sub>3</sub> plus 300 microg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcifediol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcifediol</a> in another) with a lower dose (24,000 international units vitamin D<sub>3</sub>) in community-dwelling men and women age 70 and older who had a history of a prior fall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Lower-extremity function at 12 months did not differ among the groups, but there was a higher incidence of falls and mean number of falls in both groups that received high-dose vitamin D. Of note, there was no placebo group in this trial.</p><p/><p>Two randomized trials of daily high-dose vitamin D supplementation are ongoing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>It is important to ask about dietary supplements (some of which contain vitamin D) that patients may be taking, as well as assessing other contributors to vitamin D status such as dietary intake, presence of obesity, and sun exposure before prescribing extra vitamin D, since the amount of supplemental vitamin D should take these factors into account. This point is highlighted in the 2013 American Geriatrics Society guidelines for vitamin D to prevent falls and their consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. It should also be remembered that very high intermittent doses of vitamin D may increase risk of falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] and that acute toxicity can occur, but at doses exceeding 4000 units per day.

In a subsequent cluster randomized trial, a standardized set of home safety interventions (installation of stair hand rails, grab rails in bathrooms, improved lighting, slip-resistant deck surfacing, nonslip bath mats, pamphlet on home safety) resulted in a 26 percent decline (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58-0.94) in injuries caused by falls over a three-year period, compared with study households that were wait-listed for the intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Vision assessment and correction did not reduce risk or rate of falls in four trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].
