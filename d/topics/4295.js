In this setting, the renal disease is also called &quot;HIV-associated nephropathy.&quot; Collapsing FSGS has also been increasingly recognized in non-HIV-infected patients.</p><p>Whether associated with HIV infection or other disorders, patients typically present with the nephrotic syndrome and, on renal biopsy, show segmentally or globally collapsed and sclerotic glomerular capillaries, pseudocrescents composed of hyperplastic glomerular epithelial cells, and severe tubulointerstitial disease.</p><p>Collapsing FSGS not associated with HIV infection will be reviewed here.

As with HIV-associated nephropathy, the underlying pathogenic event appears to be a severe insult to the integrity and biology of the glomerular visceral (podocytes) and parietal epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This damage ultimately results in cellular dedifferentiation and proliferation of these glomerular epithelial cells accompanied by a profound loss of the glomerular filtration barrier function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Most cases of collapsing FSGS not associated with HIV infection are idiopathic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, collapsing FSGS has been reported to occur in association with a growing list of disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F72313\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72313 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In one series of 42 patients, for example, concurrent illnesses were present in 13 (31 percent); these included a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like disorder, hepatitis C virus infection, and multiple myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H965871752\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of immune activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A strong clinical correlate suggesting causality for collapsing FSGS is its association with disorders that activate the immune system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F72313\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72313 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Proinflammatory cytokines produced during immune responses upregulate the expression of mutant <em>APOL1</em> alleles in glomerular epithelial cells, causing direct injury to these cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. APOL1 protein and mRNA are now known to be expressed in human glomerular epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of infections other than HIV infection have been associated with collapsing FSGS. These include parvovirus B19, pulmonary tuberculosis, cytomegalovirus infection, and leishmaniasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F72313\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72313 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. The fact that these infections, like HIV, activate the immune system supports a role for immune activation in precipitating collapsing FSGS. However, since most infections (excluding parvovirus) are not commonly associated with collapsing FSGS and since the infections mentioned above have been found in patients with other patterns of FSGS, further studies are needed to better understand these associations. (See <a href=\"#H965871752\" class=\"local\">'Role of immune activation'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H965871797\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemophagocytosis syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with collapsing FSGS have the hemophagocytosis syndrome, a non-malignant activation of bone marrow histiocytes, which phagocytose blood cell precursors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. This syndrome, which is characterized by high levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines (ie, cytokine &quot;storm&quot;) and serum ferritin (often greater than 3000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L),</span> can be seen in the setting of infections, autoimmune disease, or lymphoma.

A number of additional cases of pamidronate-associated collapsing FSGS have since been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Almost all patients with pamidronate-related collapsing FSGS have been white [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/1,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14-16</a>], and most have been older than 55 years of age. This contrasts with other patients who have collapsing FSGS, the majority of whom are young, black individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pamidronate</a> has also been associated with nephrotic syndrome due to other glomerular lesions, including non-collapsing FSGS and minimal change disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16</a>].

De novo disease may be associated with rapidly progressive graft failure.</p><p>The pathogenesis of this disorder is not known. It may be in part related to rejection or renal ischemia.

As an example, a retrospective review of kidney biopsies performed in patients with SLE over a seven-year period revealed 19 HIV-negative patients with collapsing FSGS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Most patients identified were black females (17 and 15 patients, respectively), and 16 of the 19 patients had symptoms of an active lupus flare at the time of biopsy.

Less than one-half of the patients had concurrent lupus nephritis identified histologically. Follow-up data were available on 13 patients, more than one-half of whom progressed to end-stage renal disease within two years.</p><p>Importantly, the development of collapsing FSGS in blacks with SLE is associated with risk polymorphisms in the <em>APOL1</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In one study, for example, collapsing FSGS (in the absence of HIV) was identified as an additional finding in the biopsies of 11 out of 128 adults with IgA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Compared with other patients in the series, those with histologic features of collapsing FSGS had significantly higher serum creatinine concentrations and significantly more proteinuria at the time of diagnosis. Ten of these 11 patients were followed for a mean of 44 months; nine required dialysis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H965871808\"><span class=\"h2\">Diabetic nephropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typical histopathologic and clinical features of collapsing FSGS have also been noted in patients with diabetic nephropathy. In a study of 534 patients with diabetic nephropathy, for example, 26 HIV-negative patients had collapsing FSGS superimposed on diabetic nephropathy (5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Those with both lesions had more severe disease at the time of biopsy (the mean serum creatinine was 3.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and mean 24-hour proteinuria was 9.8 grams), and the development of end-stage renal disease was more rapid than in patients with diabetic nephropathy but without collapsing FSGS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some susceptibility genes for collapsing FSGS may encode for proteins directly involved in mitochondrial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As an example, primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency secondary to genetic defects in the COQ2 gene or PDSS2 gene is a cause of collapsing FSGS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. This suggests that some disorders associated with collapsing FSGS may induce disease by affecting mitochondrial function, an important pathway leading to cell death, in renal parenchyma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-involvement-in-the-mitochondrial-cytopathies#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal involvement in the mitochondrial cytopathies&quot;, section on 'Glomerular disease'</a>.)</p><p>There also appears to be a correlation between MHC genes and collapsing FSGS. Collapsing FSGS was described in four of five siblings in a single family, with two having clinical symptoms suggestive but not diagnostic of SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. All siblings had inherited the same MHC haplotype from the mother, who did not have renal disease. The sole unaffected sibling, who was seven years old, also had inherited this haplotype, but may have been too young to have developed the disorder. The linkage between the MHC haplotype and collapsing FSGS in some but not all individuals suggests that other, perhaps environmental, factors also contribute. </p><p>Other kindreds with familial collapsing FSGS have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In one, genetic defects in the <em>TRPC6</em> gene were identified, which have also been linked to primary (non-collapsing FSGS). This emphasizes that known genetic forms of FSGS can present with a collapsing pattern.</p><p>There is a predominance of blacks noted in most reports of idiopathic collapsing FSGS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], with the exception of bisphosphonate-induced disease in which almost all reported patients have been white [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. This suggests that the inheritance of certain common genetic traits in some ethnic groups may in part underlie a predisposition to this disorder, although many other factors may be causative (such as common environmental exposures). Mutant alleles of <em>APOL1</em> are now recognized as the most prevalent susceptibility genes for the development of collapsing glomerulopathy in patients of African ancestry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/29,37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,37-39</a>].

In idiopathic collapsing FSGS, tubuloreticular inclusions are absent from glomerular endothelial cells, in contradistinction to untreated HIV nephropathy. An unresolved question is how many glomeruli must display a collapsing lesion for the diagnosis to be made. Given its poor prognosis, the Columbia classification scheme suggests that a collapsing lesion in one capillary loop is significant and diagnostic, thereby superseding the diagnosis of any other form of FSGS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute kidney injury plus nephrotic syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute kidney injury (AKI) in those with pure nephrotic states (ie, inactive urine sediment) is unusual.

Also, patients treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, may develop minimal change nephrotic syndrome plus AKI, which also frequently occurs in association with an acute interstitial nephritis. Likewise, acute interstitial nephritis due to other medications has been reported in patients with the nephrotic syndrome (eg, diuretic-induced acute interstitial nephritis). This is distinguished from collapsing FSGS by findings on renal biopsy.

However, most nephrotic patients with renal vein thrombosis have relatively stable renal function; an elevation in the plasma creatinine concentration primarily occurs in the infrequent patient with acute renal vein thrombosis that produces renal infarction and flank pain.

Two factors would point toward the diagnosis of collapsing FSGS in such patients: a clinical history of marked proteinuria with acute renal failure, which is not specific for collapsing FSGS but not often seen in idiopathic FSGS, and the characteristic microcystic tubular changes described above.

A small number of HIV-negative patients with collapsing FSGS have undergone complete remission in response to therapy.</p><p>For first-line therapy, we administer oral glucocorticoids for six months. We typically give oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 120 mg every other day for the first two months, then subsequently taper the dose by 20 mg every two weeks until 40 mg every other day is reached. This dose is continued until six months of therapy are completed, at which time we discontinue the prednisone without further taper. Some clinicians prefer to start with daily dosing of glucocorticoids and then change to alternate-day therapy. Glucocorticoids should be used with caution, if at all, in those at high risk for infection or in diabetics. Some but not all UpToDate contributors to this topic administer antimicrobial prophylaxis against <em>Pneumocystis </em>pneumonia (PCP) for the duration of glucocorticoid treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-pneumocystis-pneumonia-in-hiv-uninfected-patients#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;, section on 'Prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with large amounts of proteinuria (&gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day),</span> severe hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin of &lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> and preserved glomerular filtration rate (GFR), we prefer to add a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) to the glucocorticoid regimen to accelerate reversal of the hypoalbuminemia and proteinuria. The dosing and duration of calcineurin inhibitors in patients with collapsing FSGS are the same as for patients receiving these drugs as initial therapy for primary (idiopathic) FSGS.

In a retrospective analysis of 275 patients who underwent immunosuppressive treatment for biopsy-proven primary FSGS (15 percent of whom had collapsing FSGS), there was no difference in the adjusted risk of end-stage renal disease between patients treated with CNIs (with or without glucocorticoids) compared with those treated with glucocorticoids alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p>In an attempt to lower the rate of decline in renal function, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) has been recommended as routine therapy as it is in HIV-associated disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. However, there is no clear evidence that this will lead to a persistent lowering of proteinuria, and ACE inhibitors and ARBs must be used with caution among those patients with reduced GFR.</p><p>In addition, patients with persistent nephrotic syndrome and hypercholesterolemia can be treated with lipid-lowering therapy, usually beginning with a statin.

Collapsing FSGS is most often seen in association with HIV infection but is increasingly recognized in non-HIV-infected patients. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The underlying pathogenic event appears to be a severe insult to the integrity and biology of the glomerular visceral epithelial cells (podocytes) resulting in their cellular dedifferentiation and proliferation. This is accompanied by a profound loss of function of the glomerular filtration barrier. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Collapsing FSGS has been reported in association with viral infections, autoimmune disorders, the hemophagocytosis syndrome, renal transplant, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), IgA nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy, and certain drugs, particularly bisphosphonates. Many of these disorders cause immune activation, which may precipitate collapsing FSGS by upregulating the expression of mutant <em>APOL1</em> in glomerular epithelial cells. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and etiology'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There may be a genetic predisposition toward collapsing FSGS. Blacks with risk polymorphisms in the <em>APOL1</em> gene are at increased susceptibility to develop collapsing glomerulopathy. Other possible susceptibility genes for collapsing FSGS encode for proteins directly involved in mitochondrial function. There may also be an association with MHC genes. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Genetic factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients may present with an antecedent febrile illness (often suggesting a viral syndrome), severe nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, and rapid progression to end-stage renal disease. On urinalysis, a nephrotic-type sediment is observed, occasionally with large granular casts, and is associated with heavy proteinuria and lipiduria. Extremely severe proteinuria (often &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> is the rule. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Clinical characteristics'</a> above.) In general, the course of collapsing FSGS is more progressive than that of other forms of FSGS. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of collapsing FSGS includes other disorders that cause both acute kidney injury (AKI) and a pure nephrotic instead of a nephritic state. These include idiopathic minimal change disease, which may occur concurrently with AKI; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-associated minimal change disease, which frequently occurs in association with an acute interstitial nephritis; membranous nephropathy, in which AKI is due to the superimposition of a crescentic glomerulonephritis or interstitial nephritis; acute bilateral renal vein thrombosis; and monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease, which is occasionally associated with myeloma cast nephropathy and AKI. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis is generally made by renal biopsy, which reveals collapse and sclerosis of the entire glomerular tuft, marked hypertrophy and hyperplasia of podocytes, degeneration and cystic dilatation of tubules and wrinkling and retraction of the glomerular basement membrane. An accurate diagnosis requires careful interpretation of both clinical and histologic features. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Histologic findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no prospective controlled trials to guide the treatment of collapsing FSGS. Early glucocorticoid treatment may achieve higher remission rates, especially for patients who present with serum creatinine concentrations of less than 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> and less severe renal pathology. We administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at a dose of 120 mg every other day for the first two months, then subsequently taper the dose by 20 mg every two weeks until 40 mg every other day is reached.

For patients with large amounts of proteinuria (&gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day),</span> severe hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin of &lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> and preserved GFR, we prefer to add a calcineurin inhibitor to the glucocorticoid regimen to accelerate reversal of the hypoalbuminemia and proteinuria. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonimmunosuppressive treatment commonly includes the administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in an attempt to decrease proteinuria, and lipid-lowering therapy for patients with persistent nephrotic syndrome and hypercholesterolemia. No controlled trials of this treatment approach have been conducted. Bisphosphonates and other potentially implicated agents should be promptly discontinued in patients who develop collapsing FSGS. The role of treatment of non-HIV infections thought to play a role (eg, parvovirus; polyoma virus) is unknown.
