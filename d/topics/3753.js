A <em>VHL</em> gene abnormality diagnostic for VHL syndrome is present in approximately 1 in 36,000 individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. </p><p>The initial manifestations of disease can occur in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood, with a mean age at initial presentation of approximately 26 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The molecular biology and pathogenesis of VHL disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular biology and pathogenesis of von Hippel-Lindau disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF VHL DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Families with VHL disease have been divided into types 1 and 2, based upon the likelihood of developing pheochromocytoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Type 2 families are more likely to carry a missense mutation in the <em>VHL</em> gene.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type 1</strong> &ndash; Patients in kindreds with type 1 disease have a substantially lower risk of developing pheochromocytomas (type 1A) and a lower risk of both pheochromocytomas and renal cell carcinoma (RCC; type 1B), although they are at high risk for the other VHL-associated lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type 2</strong> &ndash; Kindreds with type 2 disease are at high risk for developing pheochromocytoma. Type 2 disease is subdivided based upon the risk of developing RCC. Type 2A and 2B families have a low and high incidence of RCC, respectively, while type 2C kindreds are characterized by the development of pheochromocytomas only, without RCC or hemangioblastoma. These subclassifications should be used as a guide and are not absolute. Continued surveillance for other VHL-related lesions should continue, for example, in individuals who present with type 2C characteristics.</p><p/><p>The goal of improving survival and quality of life in patients with VHL disease has been aided by a better understanding of the natural history of VHL-associated tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As a result, surveillance strategies have been developed for affected individuals, which have led to the detection of small, asymptomatic tumors prior to the development of metastases or other complications. In addition, therapeutic advances (eg, renal-sparing surgery in RCC) have improved outcomes by decreasing the incidence of renal failure when therapy is required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma#H387391471\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definitive surgical management of renal cell carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Partial nephrectomy'</a>.)</p><p>The molecular pathogenesis of VHL disease is discussed elsewhere. A &quot;two-hit&quot; model appears to apply to this disorder. Affected patients have a germline mutation that inactivates one copy of the <em>VHL</em> gene in all cells. For disease to occur there must be loss of expression of the second, normal allele through somatic mutation or deletion of the second allele, or through hypermethylation of its promoter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular biology and pathogenesis of von Hippel-Lindau disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1986453\"><span class=\"h1\">OCCURRENCE AND AGE OF ONSET OF VHL-RELATED LESIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VHL-related lesions occur over a wide range of ages, as outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F83902\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83902 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Age of onset of screening varies by lesion, with screening for retinal lesions commencing in infancy and screening for other lesions starting slightly later. (See <a href=\"#H3121858651\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance protocols'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMANGIOBLASTOMAS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemangioblastomas are well-circumscribed, capillary vessel-rich benign neoplasms, which do not invade locally or metastasize. However, they can cause symptoms through pressure on adjacent structures and through hemorrhage, due to either the hemangioblastoma itself or cyst formation around the lesion. The clinical presentation and management of sporadic hemangioblastomas are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemangioblastoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemangioblastoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hemangioblastomas are the most common lesions associated with VHL disease, affecting 60 to 84 percent of patients, and typically occur in the cerebellum, spinal cord, or retina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/1,2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,7</a>]. Patients with VHL-associated hemangioblastomas tend to be younger than those with sporadic hemangioblastomas with a mean age at diagnosis in one series of 29 years, and a range of 9 to 78 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While sporadic hemangioblastomas usually are solitary and generally do not recur after surgery, lesions in patients with VHL disease tend to be infratentorial and multiple [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a detailed analysis of 160 patients with VHL disease and hemangioblastoma, 655 discrete tumors were identified, of which 51 percent were in the spinal cord, 38 percent in the cerebellum, 10 percent in the brainstem, and 2 percent supratentorial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In a cohort of 188 consecutive patients presenting with a seemingly sporadic hemangioblastoma, no family history of VHL, and no other evidence of the disease, <em>VHL</em> germline mutations were present in 5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Of those who tested negative, 5 percent developed a VHL-related lesion in the ensuing years, which may result from being mosaic for a <em>VHL</em> mutation. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Somatic mosaicism'</a> below.)</p><p>Thus, we recommend that all patients with either a retinal or central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastoma be tested for <em>VHL</em> germline mutations, even in the case of a single lesion, given the high sensitivity and specificity of the testing. Where access to genetic investigations is limited, it would be reasonable to focus testing on patients with lesions presenting under the age of 50 years since the likelihood of identifying a germline <em>VHL</em> mutation is inversely correlated with the age of the patient.</p><p>Because CNS hemangioblastomas often initially develop in the second decade, routine screening with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord is recommended in patients with VHL disease starting after age 8 years. (See <a href=\"#H3121858651\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance protocols'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CNS hemangioblastomas can remain dormant for unpredictable periods of time or can present with accelerated growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. Currently there are no definitive clinical (eg, age, gender, location), radiographic, or specific molecular markers (ie, underlying mutations) that can predict the natural history of a given lesion, and regular follow-up with imaging and observation of clinical signs and symptoms is necessary. </p><p>A review of 225 patients with 1921 CNS hemangioblastomas demonstrated that 51 percent of lesions did not grow. In the remaining 49 percent of hemangioblastomas, 72 percent grew in a saltatory (stepwise), 6 percent in a linear, and 22 percent in an exponential fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Partial germline deletions and male sex were associated with increased tumor burden. The unpredictable nature of hemangioblastoma growth emphasizes the need for ongoing surveillance in these patients.</p><p>Therapeutic efforts should focus on avoiding treatment-related morbidity by minimizing the frequency of surgical interventions because of the frequent development of multiple lesions. Small asymptomatic lesions can be followed with careful surveillance. Although surgery usually can successfully remove lesions in the spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebellum, intervention is reserved until lesions become symptomatic or they display accelerated growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/7,8,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,12,13</a>]. Patients who demonstrate progression by neural imaging should be followed at more frequent intervals for evidence of clinical symptoms.</p><p>Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and conventional fractionated radiation therapy (RT) may play a role in treating lesions that are not readily accessible by surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. There are no randomized prospective studies that compare the long-term efficacy and safety of SRS with conventional RT for hemangioblastomas. In a prospective observational study performed at the National Institutes of Health, diminishing tumor control over time was observed in lesions treated with SRS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. On the basis of these findings, prophylactic treatment of asymptomatic hemangioblastomas with SRS is not recommended, and surgery is still considered the standard of care when feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>At this time, no effective systemic therapy has been validated for hemangioblastomas. A prospective clinical trial with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a>, an antiangiogenic agent, failed to demonstrate response in hemangioblastomas, although this class of agents is being used for renal cell carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Preclinical data suggested that inhibitors of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) may provide some value in the management of hemangioblastomas. Based on these findings, a case report of response to the antiangiogenic agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pazopanib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pazopanib</a>, which possesses modest FGFR blocking activity, was reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Further work needs to be done to define the value of specific antiangiogenic agents for hemangioblastomas.</p><p>Outcomes with different therapeutic approaches for the management of hemangioblastoma are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemangioblastoma#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemangioblastoma&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RETINAL CAPILLARY HEMANGIOBLASTOMAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retinal capillary hemangioblastomas are typically found either in the peripheral retina <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the juxtapapillary region. Visual loss from retinal capillary hemangioblastomas is generally caused by exudation from the tumor, causing retinal edema or by tractional effects, in which glial proliferation on the surface of the tumor induces retinal striae and distortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In addition, retinal capillary hemangioblastomas can hemorrhage, leading to retinal detachment, glaucoma, and loss of vision.</p><p>Retinal capillary hemangioblastomas are found in up to 70 percent of VHL patients by age 60 years; they are often multifocal and bilateral. Compared with patients with sporadic retinal hemangioblastomas, patients with VHL are much younger and more likely to have multiple lesions. In one series of 31 patients with VHL and 37 patients without VHL disease, the VHL patients were younger (18 versus 36 years of age, respectively), had an average of four tumors, and were more likely to develop new tumors than those without the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>In a study of 890 patients with VHL, 335 patients had a retinal capillary hemangioblastoma in at least one eye. Lesions were detected unilaterally in 42 percent and bilaterally in 58 percent of affected patients. No correlation was detected between the age, gender, or laterality of involvement. Of involved eyes, 87 percent had tumors that could be individually visualized; of these, tumors were commonly found in the peripheral retina (85 percent) only, and less commonly in the juxtapapillary area (15 percent). The tumor count in the periphery averaged 2.<span class=\"nowrap\">5+/-1</span>.8 per eye, with 25 percent of eyes having more than one quadrant of retinal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. An assessment of the genotype-phenotype relationship in retinal capillary hemangioblastoma suggested that 15 percent of individuals with complete deletions of VHL protein had hemangioblastoma development versus an overall prevalence in the patient population of 37 percent. The risk of vision loss was found to increase with age although tumor number did not increase significantly as a function of age.</p><p>As is the case with seemingly sporadic central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas, any patient presenting with a retinal capillary hemangioblastoma (particularly if prior to age 40) should have a complete evaluation for the presence of VHL. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.) </p><p>Routine surveillance for retinal capillary hemangioblastoma is recommended for patients with VHL disease because of its high frequency. The frequent onset of such lesions during childhood makes it important to initiate ophthalmologic surveillance in the pediatric population upon making the diagnosis, and it is one of the reasons that genetic testing for <em>VHL </em>mutations in young children is recommended. (See <a href=\"#H3121858651\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance protocols'</a> below.)</p><p>The treatment of retinal capillary hemangioblastoma requires that the benefits of treatment be balanced against potential treatment-related complications. Whether the smallest lesions can be carefully observed without specific treatment until there is any evidence of growth or symptoms is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Some groups recommend that retinal capillary hemangioblastoma be treated immediately upon detection in order to prevent growth and complications, whereas others wait for some change in size before initiating treatment. </p><p>Laser photocoagulation and cryotherapy are effective in over 70 percent of cases, generally with a single treatment, and are the preferred methods of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. An exception is that hemangioblastomas of the optic nerve should not be treated with these methods because of the deleterious side effects on the normal retina. Photodynamic therapy can also be considered as an option in the treatment of retinal capillary hemangioblastoma, although limited data exist on its efficacy. External beam RT may have a role for salvage therapy if other modalities have failed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Investigational approaches have focused on interfering with angiogenesis. The experimental vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor inhibitor semaxinib (SU5416) was reported to successfully reduce peritumoral edema and improve vision in six patients with VHL, although the drug did not reduce the actual tumor size itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. This agent is not commercially available.</p><p>In a study assessing impact of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a> on VHL-related lesions, the very small number of individuals with retinal lesions did not show signs of improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In a small study, the VEGF-binding monoclonal antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranibizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranibizumab</a> produced only a minimal effect in one of five patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. These types of investigational approaches may be useful to reduce the symptoms generated from hemangioblastomas of the optic nerve that are difficult to treat. Further studies need to be performed to better understand the biology of the hemangioblastoma cell of origin and its endothelium, and to develop more effective systemic therapies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">RENAL CELL CARCINOMAS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with VHL disease are at risk for developing multiple renal cysts and renal cell carcinomas (RCC), which occur in approximately two-thirds of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

RCCs of predominant papillary, chromophobe, or oncocytic histology are not associated with VHL disease, but can be associated with other cancer susceptibility syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].

RCC occurs with increasing frequency thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/1,2,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,31</a>]. The mean age at onset in one large series was 44 years and it was estimated that 69 percent of patients surviving to age 60 would develop RCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The incidence of RCC is lower in patients who carry missense mutations in the <em>VHL</em> gene in which pheochromocytoma is prominent, although the same surveillance recommendations apply independently of the mutation type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Types of VHL disease'</a> above.)</p><p>RCCs are often multicentric and bilateral, and can arise either in conjunction with cysts or de novo from noncystic renal parenchyma. Although renal cysts may be benign, they are thought to represent a premalignant lesion; solid components within otherwise benign-appearing renal cysts almost always contain RCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Systematic microscopic analysis identified numerous clear cell abnormalities, which are thought to be precursors for clear cell RCC.

Gene copy number loss is assessed using read-depth from NGS data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>] or confirmed directly using a targeted chromosomal microarray <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Many patients now undergo genetic testing using larger multi-gene panels by NGS analysis that include the <em>VHL</em> gene as one of the cancer susceptibility genes under study, including those cancer patients undergoing paired <span class=\"nowrap\">tumor/normal</span> sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. </p><p>Germline mutations in the <em>VHL</em> gene can be inherited or arise de novo. The latter frequency has been reported to be as high as 20 percent of VHL patients in older studies, although this has not explored in detail in more recent studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Rare patients may have the clinical features of VHL without a detectable mutation due to mosaicism for the <em>VHL</em> mutation. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Somatic mosaicism'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients suspected of having VHL disease should be referred to specialized centers for evaluation, genetic counseling, and definitive diagnosis, even if there is no family history of VHL disease. Approved VHL Clinical Care Centers are listed at the <a href=\"http://www.vhl.org/&amp;token=BiXFESOBxcNf0Yq/yIPVbamuVQZvfGE7OlAy09doazc=&amp;TOPIC_ID=1306\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">VHL Alliance</a> website. These centers have been approved for standards of care that were developed by the VHL Alliance's medical advisory board. </p><p>Comprehensive genetic testing of the <em>VHL</em> gene should be based on the presence of one or more characteristic lesions. Proposed criteria for testing are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57447\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57447 \">table 2</a>). Testing for a specific familial <em>VHL</em> mutation should then be performed for at-risk relatives based upon having a blood relative with an established diagnosis of VHL disease.</p><p>Over the last five years, there has been an increasing use of whole exome sequencing for diagnosis of Mendelian disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Given this change in practice, there are now recommendations by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics for the reporting of the incidental (or secondary) findings of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in a list of 56 genes (including the <em>VHL</em> gene), even if the original indication for testing was unrelated to a cancer diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Thus, there is the likelihood that individuals, particularly young children, will be molecularly diagnosed with presymptomatic VHL disease prior to any features of the disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Somatic mosaicism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a patient with somatic mosaicism, a mutation occurs during embryonic development after fertilization; in these circumstances, some cells will be normal while others carry the mutation. In contrast to detecting germline mutations, diagnostic difficulties are more likely as the clinical presentation depends on the proportion of cells that carry the <em>VHL</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,89</a>]. Although an individual with somatic mosaicism may present with classic VHL disease, the mutation may not be detectable in the peripheral blood because the hematologic stem cells do not carry the mutation.</p><p>Thus, the possibility of mosaicism should be considered in patients presenting with VHL-associated tumors and a negative <em>VHL</em> genetic test using peripheral blood cells. The disease manifestations in such patients are dependent upon when the de novo mutation event occurred in embryogenesis. The earlier the new mutation occurred, the more tissue types are likely to be affected. The use of NGS technologies for <em>VHL </em>mutation analysis provides increased sensitivity to detect <em>VHL</em> variants that exist at very low levels in the blood sample compared with older Sanger sequencing methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Additional testing approaches for mosaicism can include genetic analyses of skin fibroblasts or buccal mucosal cells. Testing of multiple tumors from the same patient with mosaicism can sometimes provide information on the causative mutation shared across tumors, but it should be interpreted by an experienced geneticist or genetic counselor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be referred for appropriate genetic advice in conjunction with testing for <em>VHL</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. VHL disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, and affected individuals have a 50 percent probability of transmitting the <em>VHL</em> mutation to each offspring.</p><p>Among patients with somatic mosaicism, the risk to offspring depends upon whether or not the germ tissue carries the mutation, although that cannot be determined clinically. Thus, patients with documented mosaicism should be counseled that their risk of having an affected child may be as high as 50 percent and that any affected child will inherit the mutation in 100 percent of their cells and will potentially have more severe manifestations of the disease than the mosaic parent.</p><p>The diagnosis of VHL in a child of unaffected parents can be very alarming, and the concept of de novo mutations should be carefully explained. In particular, parents should be reassured and potential guilt alleviated by explaining that the mutation is unlikely to be the result of any action that occurred immediately prior to or during the pregnancy. </p><p>There is increasing awareness of the concern of parents as to when to provide information about the diagnosis to children with a positive <em>VHL </em>genetic test. In general, it is best for this information to be conveyed in multiple settings as the child's maturity increases, and parents may benefit from the support of a medical professional in initiating these discussions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9384234\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY AND VHL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prospective parents planning or carrying a pregnancy at risk for VHL disease have multiple options for learning the <em>VHL</em> mutation status of the fetus. The couple may choose not to know until after the child is born. If prenatal genetic testing is not performed, then all at-risk children should be tested in infancy for the <em>VHL</em> mutation found in the affected parent in order to determine whether or not the VHL disease surveillance regimen is required.</p><p>A couple may choose prenatal diagnosis after pregnancy is initiated, utilizing a sample obtained by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Some couples that choose prenatal diagnosis wish to know the carrier status prior to birth in order to prepare, while others may elect to terminate a pregnancy if the fetus is affected. Prospective parents should also be provided with information about reproductive technologies that greatly lower their risk of having a child with VHL disease, such as sperm or oocyte donation (depending on which parent is affected), and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. The latter involves testing embryos fertilized in vitro for the familial <em>VHL</em> mutation, usually on a single cell of a blastocyst, and selecting unaffected embryos for implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. The various reproductive options available to prospective parents require thoughtful discussion and genetic counseling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preimplantation-genetic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preimplantation genetic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Whether VHL-related lesions demonstrate new or accelerated growth during pregnancy is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/92-94\" class=\"abstract_t\">92-94</a>]. Nevertheless, it is prudent to take particular care during follow-up of these individuals, especially if they have a prior history of pheochromocytomas, CNS lesions, or retinal lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>]. </p><p>All women with pheochromocytomas need to have these surgically removed before attempting to become pregnant. Growth or development of pheochromocytomas can have catastrophic consequences during pregnancy and delivery, so plasma metanephrine and normetanephrine testing during early and late pregnancy is warranted. </p><p>Women with existing retinal, brain, and spinal cord lesions may be at increased risk for tumor growth during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/93,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,95</a>]. Eyes should be checked regularly throughout the pregnancy, and noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be considered in the fourth month to follow up on CNS lesions. Delivery via cesarean section should be considered to lower the probability of developing increased intracranial pressure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3121858651\"><span class=\"h1\">SURVEILLANCE PROTOCOLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Morbidity and mortality in patients with VHL disease have decreased substantially due to an improved understanding of the natural history of the serious clinical manifestations of the disorder, better imaging techniques, and improvements in therapy. Surveillance is important not only to detect new lesions at an early stage, but also to monitor small asymptomatic lesions for evidence of progression.</p><p>Surveillance protocols originally focused on hemangioblastomas (including retinal capillary hemangioblastomas), renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), and pheochromocytomas, the three manifestations most often resulting in severe disability or death. More recently, audiology has been added to these regimens with recognition of the increased risk of endolymphatic sac tumors (ELST) in patients with VHL. Surveillance recommendations need to be adapted to the individual patient, taking into account the presence of previously diagnosed asymptomatic disease and disease manifestations in other members of the family. However, there is variability within families, and patients should understand that they may develop manifestations of VHL disease that were not seen in their affected relatives.</p><p>There is some controversy concerning the optimal frequency for various imaging and screening procedures, which attempts to balance the risks and costs versus the potential for a delayed diagnosis. An international panel of clinicians who care for children with VHL was convened as part of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Childhood Cancer Predisposition Workshop. The panel reviewed the current American and European VHL regimens and published surveillance recommendations that involve some increase in the intensity and earlier commencement of screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p>The following summarizes those recommendations in the pediatric age range and those of the VHL Alliance in conjunction with their medical advisory board for adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1302661170\"><span class=\"h2\">Ages 0 to 4</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H710534876\"><span class=\"h3\">Annually</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Eye/retinal</span> examination with indirect ophthalmoscopy by an ophthalmologist skilled in diagnosis and management of retinal disease, especially for children known to carry the <em>VHL</em> mutation from infancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pediatrician to look for signs of neurological disturbance, nystagmus, strabismus, white pupil, and abnormalities in blood pressure, vision, or hearing. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beginning at age 2 years, annual plasma free metanephrines or 24-hour urinary fractionated metanephrines.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1867096485\"><span class=\"h2\">Ages 5 to 10</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2220394989\"><span class=\"h3\">Annually</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination and neurological assessment by a pediatrician informed about VHL disease, with particular attention to blood pressure (lying and standing), hearing issues, neurological disturbance, nystagmus, strabismus, white pupil, and other signs which might indicate the need for a referral to a retinal specialist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Eye/retinal</span> examination with indirect ophthalmoscopy by an ophthalmologist informed about VHL, using a dilated exam.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Test for plasma metanephrines or urinary metanephrines using 24-hour urine test. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal ultrasonography annually from eight years or earlier if indicated.

The spectrum of VHL-associated tumors includes hemangioblastomas (including retinal hemangioblastomas), clear cell renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), pheochromocytomas, endolymphatic sac tumors (ELSTs) of the middle ear, serous cystadenomas and neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas, and papillary cystadenomas of the epididymis and broad ligament.</p><p>The primary goal of management for patients with VHL disease is the early diagnosis and treatment of tumors that otherwise might cause severe disability or death:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of VHL disease is based upon the detection of a germline mutation in the <em>VHL</em> gene, and rarely, by multiple VHL-associated tumors in the absence of a germline mutation. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the increasing use of next-generation sequencing test methods in the care of cancer patients, there is likely to be an increase in the diagnosis of VHL disease in patients with the apparently sporadic forms of VHL-associated tumors, as well as, more rarely, from incidental findings in patients undergoing whole exome or genome sequencing for other indications. Changes in ascertainment, for example by secondary finding analysis in patients undergoing whole genome or whole exome sequencing, may result in an apparent amelioration of the disease burden since current knowledge is primarily based on individuals presenting with symptomatic disease and their close relatives. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central nervous system hemangioblastomas are the most common lesions in patients with VHL disease and tend to be multiple and infratentorial. Annual retinal examinations should be initiated beginning in infancy or early childhood to diagnose and treat retinal hemangioblastomas at an early enough stage to preserve vision. Every other year, imaging of the brain and spinal cord with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) starting after the age of 15 years is indicated to establish the diagnosis and minimize disease-related complications. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Hemangioblastomas'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3121858651\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance protocols'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clear cell RCCs occur in approximately 70 percent of VHL patients who survive to 60 years of age. Annual imaging of the kidneys with MRI or computed tomography (CT) is indicated to establish the diagnosis. For patients in whom an RCC is diagnosed, we recommend a nephron-sparing approach to remove lesions that are 3 cm or larger whenever possible (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Renal cell carcinomas'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation for renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma#H387391471\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definitive surgical management of renal cell carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Partial nephrectomy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pheochromocytomas tend to be seen in younger patients, are often multiple or extra-adrenal, and although symptoms can be present, are less likely to be associated with symptoms or biochemical evidence of catecholamine production compared with those occurring in patients without VHL disease who are primarily diagnosed based on the presence of symptoms. Annual assessment of plasma metanephrines should begin with young children. Annual imaging of the abdomen for pheochromocytomas and pancreatic tumors should be initiated in early adolescence. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Pheochromocytomas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ELSTs are slowly growing lesions that can cause significant hearing loss and may be bilateral. Baseline audiometry should begin in early childhood, and appropriate imaging should be carried out based on symptoms. Retesting and appropriate imaging are indicated if there are symptoms of ringing, tinnitus, pain, or change in auditory acuity. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Endolymphatic sac tumors of the middle ear'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prospective parents planning or carrying a pregnancy at risk for VHL disease should be offered genetic counseling and should also be provided with information about reproductive technologies that lower their risk of having a child with VHL (see <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Genetic counseling'</a> above). Additionally, women who plan to or become pregnant may need a much higher level of surveillance than usual.
