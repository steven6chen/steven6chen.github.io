The Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies are caused by mutations of the dystrophin gene and are therefore named dystrophinopathies. Weakness is the principal symptom as muscle fiber degeneration is the primary pathologic process.</p><p/><p>The dystrophinopathies are inherited as X-linked recessive traits and have varying clinical characteristics. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is associated with the most severe clinical symptoms. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) has a similar presentation to DMD but a relatively milder clinical course.</p><p>The management and prognosis of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy will be discussed in this review. Other aspects of DMD and BMD are reviewed separately.

Intellectual, behavioral, and neuropsychiatric problems may impair development, learning, and socialization. The anticipation and early detection of these problems is important for optimal therapy, and a multidisciplinary care plan is essential to ensure access to appropriate specialists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-management-and-prognosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Patients with DMD and BMD should have physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy according to their individual needs and stage of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-management-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2519256925\"><span class=\"h2\">Orthopedic interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should receive physical therapy to encourage mobility and to prevent or reduce the risk of contractures.

Spine radiography should be obtained if visual inspection reveals a curve or if visual inspection is problematic. In the nonambulatory stage, spine radiography should be performed every six months to one year if a curve is present, depending upon skeletal maturity. Patients with a curve &gt;20 should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon. Spine surgery to stabilize or correct scoliosis may improve function, patient comfort, sitting balance and tolerance, and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-management-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Suggested exercises include swimming and cycling, continued in the non-ambulatory phase if medically safe. Assisted cycling and robotic-assisted movement are also options in the non-ambulatory stage. Low-resistance strength training and optimization of upper body function may provide additional benefits. However, activity should be reduced if patients develop significant muscle pain or myoglobinuria within the 24-hour period after a specific activity, as these may indicate overexertion and contraction-induced muscle injury. Overexertion, eccentric muscle exercises, and high-resistance strength training or activities should be avoided because of the possible adverse effects on fragile muscles in dystrophinopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3403166845\"><span class=\"h1\">HEALTH MAINTENANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attention to nutrition, bone health, fracture and fall prevention, growth and endocrine management, and routine immunizations is important for optimizing the health and quality of life for patients with DMD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258480592\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depending upon circumstances and treatment (eg, glucocorticoids), patients with DMD can be at risk of malnutrition <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> underweight or overweight for age.

Therefore, standing height and a nonstanding growth measure (eg, arm span, ulnar length, tibia length, knee height) should be measured every six months, beginning in the ambulatory phase; nonstanding measures allow growth assessment once ambulation is lost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-management-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A decrease in growth trajectory (ie, downward crossing of a height percentile), an annual height velocity of &lt;4 cm year, or height less than the third percentile should prompt referral to an endocrinologist.

Another retrospective study of patients who had both spinal surgery and nocturnal ventilation reported a median survival of 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-management-and-prognosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Patients with BMD typically have a milder clinical course than those with DMD, and remain ambulatory beyond the age of 16 years and into adult life; they usually survive beyond the age of 30 years and have a mean age of death in the mid-40s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,34,35</a>]. The most common cause of death with BMD is heart failure from dilated cardiomyopathy, which also causes considerable morbidity in these patients despite their milder skeletal muscle involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-management-and-prognosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-glucocorticoid-and-disease-modifying-treatment#H997077185\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy: Glucocorticoid and disease-modifying treatment&quot;, section on 'Glucocorticoid treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rehabilitation for DMD requires multidisciplinary care to coordinate the multiple specialized assessments and interventions needed to maximize function and quality of life for affected individuals. Orthopedic interventions are specifically aimed at maintaining function and preventing contractures. For boys with DMD who are ambulatory or in the early nonambulatory stage of the disorder, we suggest regular submaximum (ie, gentle) exercise to avoid disuse muscle atrophy and other complications of inactivity. (See <a href=\"#H3203042247\" class=\"local\">'Rehabilitation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attention to nutrition, bone health, fracture and fall prevention, growth and endocrine management, and routine immunizations is important for optimizing function and quality of life for patients with DMD. (See <a href=\"#H3403166845\" class=\"local\">'Health maintenance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Weight and growth should be monitored, and evaluation by a <span class=\"nowrap\">dietician/nutritionist</span> is indicated at diagnosis and at every clinic visit. For all patients with DMD, we suggest dietary calcium and vitamin D supplementation in the form of dairy products, other foods rich in calcium and vitamin D, and sunshine exposure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For children with diminished intake of calcium-containing foods, we suggest calcium supplementation (500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>. Children with a serum concentration of vitamin D &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> should receive vitamin D supplementation. (See <a href=\"#H258480592\" class=\"local\">'Nutrition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A decrease in growth trajectory, an annual height velocity of &lt;4 cm year, or height less than the third percentile should prompt referral to an endocrinologist. Lack of pubertal development by age 14 years for boys should also trigger referral to an endocrinologist. (See <a href=\"#H959071003\" class=\"local\">'Endocrine management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with DMD often have risk factors for poor bone health that may include decreased mobility, muscle weakness, and side effects of glucocorticoid therapy. The approach to monitoring bone health focuses on identifying the earlies signs of bone fragility with periodic spine imaging and measurement of bone mineral density. Proactive guidance and home environment assessment and modification may reduce the risk of vertebral and long bone fractures. (See <a href=\"#H258480619\" class=\"local\">'Bone health'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3050323909\" class=\"local\">'Fracture and fall prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with DMD, a baseline assessment of cardiac function, including electrocardiogram and noninvasive cardiac imaging, is recommended at the time of diagnosis and at least annually thereafter. Female DMD carriers should have a baseline cardiac assessment in early adulthood. For boys with DMD, we recommend initiation of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) beginning by age 10 years (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2603448256\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory management is a critical component of DMD care. Serial monitoring of vital capacity should begin when the individual is five to six years of age and followed yearly during the ambulatory stage. When patients become nonambulatory, more extensive monitoring should occur at least every six months. The core respiratory therapies for DMD are lung volume recruitment, assisted coughing, nocturnally assisted ventilation, and subsequent daytime ventilation. In most cases, the need for these interventions arises after loss of ambulation. Detailed indications are listed above. (See <a href=\"#H3827293215\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychosocial care for DMD and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) includes routine assessment of the mental health of the patient and family at every clinic visit, with ongoing support and referrals to a psychiatrist or psychologist if needed. Multidisciplinary care should include educational support, vocational training, and planning for adult roles. Clinicians should sensitively engage patients and families in discussions about treatment options, advanced care planning, advanced directives, palliative care, and other end-of-life issues, as guided by patient values and preferences. (See <a href=\"#H3346191247\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with DMD have a high risk of complications when they undergo surgery or procedures requiring anesthesia or sedation, and should have preoperative evaluations by pulmonary, anesthesia, and cardiac specialists prior to any surgery. Total intravenous anesthesia is indicated for patients with DMD; depolarizing muscle relaxants are absolutely contraindicated because they carry an unacceptable risk of fatal complications, including rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, and cardiac arrest. (See <a href=\"#H1571611075\" class=\"local\">'Surgery and anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Emery AE.
