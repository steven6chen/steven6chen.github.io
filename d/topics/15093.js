Rheumatic problems are frequently seen in acromegaly including an arthropathy, which can be severe and disabling; carpal tunnel syndrome, which is often reversible; and a peripheral neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These findings may, in some cases, be a prominent initial sign of acromegaly. Acromegaly should be remembered as a rare but important cause of osteoarthritis (OA), particularly if OA is premature or associated with carpal tunnel syndrome.</p><p>The rheumatologic and bone disorders associated with acromegaly are reviewed here. The causes, other clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of acromegaly are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and clinical manifestations of acromegaly&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-acromegaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of acromegaly&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acromegaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acromegaly&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ARTHROPATHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Joint and spine disorders, most likely due to acceleration of the normal growth process, are common in acromegaly and may dominate the clinical picture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 are essential for normal growth, differentiation, and repair of cartilage and bone. Excess GH leads to a form of osteoarthritis (OA). A mechanism has been proposed to explain this process based upon in vitro studies assessing the effects of GH and IGF-1 on cartilage and connective tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excess GH and IGF-1 cause proliferation of articular chondrocytes and increased matrix production. This leads to thickened articular cartilage and widening of the joint spaces.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GH also affects connective tissue, promoting the growth of periarticular structures which results in ligamentous laxity and joint instability. Synovial hypertrophy also occurs.</p><p/><p>These processes eventually lead to wear and fissuring of the cartilage. Abnormalities in repair mechanisms, probably also due to excess GH, result in overproliferation of regenerating fibrocartilage, which may then become calcified and result in osteophyte formation. Accelerated turnover of underlying bone, subchondral cyst formation, eventual thinning of articular cartilage, and a reduction in joint space complete the picture of an OA.</p><p>A study of 67 acromegalic patients in long-term remission found an association between the pretreatment IGF-1 standard deviation (SD) scores and the risk of OA of hip, hands, and cervical spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early studies noted joint symptoms in the majority of patients with acromegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, the prevalence of joint disease in some of the later series has been lower, probably due to earlier recognition and to improved therapy. In a report of 500 patients in 1994, for example, OA was noted in approximately 45 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A smaller series of 151 patients followed for 12 years found severe arthritis in 18 percent of the 119 survivors and mild arthritis in 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, a detailed study of 89 patients with adequate long-term control of acromegaly showed radiographic evidence of OA at one or more joint sites in 99 percent of patients and symptoms of pain and stiffness at one site or more in 72 percent of patients overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. OA was significantly more common and occurred at a younger age than in the control group. A Danish cohort study of 405 acromegalic patients showed the prevalence of arthropathy to be approximately double that of controls, and this was seen zero to three years prior to diagnosis as well as 1 to 30 years after diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Comparison of studies is difficult, as differences reflect the different diagnostic criteria used for OA, the age and sex distribution of the population studied, and the degree of control and duration of acromegaly. The prevalence of radiographic OA may be higher than symptomatic OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main manifestations of the arthropathy in acromegaly include joint pain, particularly on activity. Joint swelling and tightness, crepitus, and effusions have all been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/5,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8-10</a>]. Hyperlaxity of the joints and spine can also occur, often followed by stiffness due to a combination of degenerative changes and thickening of subcutaneous tissues. Spinal pain is common, occurring in one-half of patients, and kyphoscoliosis is seen in up to 20 percent.</p><p>The sites of involvement, peripherally and axially, are variable:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The peripheral joints most commonly affected symptomatically are the knee and shoulder, while involvement of the elbow and hand is less common.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among those with axial involvement, the lumbosacral spine is affected in one-half of patients; one-third of patients also have involvement of the cervical or thoracic spine. Features of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) may be seen in 20 percent, correlating with impaired glucose tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Temporomandibular pain and malocclusion were reported in one-third of patients in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The acromegalic rosary is a palpable but not necessarily visible enlargement of the costochondral junctions. This finding occurred in 26 out of 27 subjects in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p>The relationship between the severity of joint involvement and the severity and duration of acromegaly is debatable. Arthropathy appears to be more common in older patients with a longer duration of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>]. However, there is wide variability, and arthropathy is the presenting complaint in some patients. The presence of OA is not significantly associated with increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], but has a significant negative impact on quality of life. A study of 118 acromegalic patients in remission showed that 77 percent had self-reported joint problems, particularly of the hip <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> knee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A study of 58 patients with acromegaly of over five years' duration showed that 90 percent reported musculoskeletal pain associated with reduced quality of life and poor sleep, with 88 percent consulting their general practitioner for pain and with over half consulting complementary medicine therapists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The radiographic changes of the arthropathy in acromegaly are not necessarily associated with clinical symptoms and vary according to the stage of the arthropathy. Widening of joint spaces due to cartilage overgrowth and thickening of the soft tissues occurs in the early stages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F64058\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64058 \">image 1</a>), progressing to cartilage loss and the radiographic features of degenerative joint disease, which are eventually indistinguishable from OA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F82074\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82074 \">image 2</a>). There can be persistence of the characteristic radiographic findings of wide joint spaces, despite long-term control of acromegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]; these changes may be associated with more self-reported pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Joint radiographs of the arthritis of acromegaly exhibit more osteophyte formation and less joint space narrowing at the hip and knee, compared with those of patients with primary generalized OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition to these changes in the joints, thickening of the heel pad is often seen.</p><p>A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study compared active and controlled acromegalic patients with controls with primary osteoarthritis of the knee; acromegalic patients had less cysts and bone marrow lesions but a similar prevalence of osteophytosis and cartilage defects. Cartilage thickness was greater in acromegalic patients compared with controls, and there was a small but significant increase in cartilage thickness in those with active acromegaly compared with controlled acromegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Chondrocalcinosis has also been reported in association with acromegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It is not clear, however, if this is a real or coincidental finding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment and prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of the arthropathy and much of the cartilaginous thickening may improve with treatment of the acromegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/9,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,20</a>]. A decrease toward normal of articular cartilage thickness has been documented ultrasonographically following 12 months of treatment with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lanreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lanreotide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acromegaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acromegaly&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, once bone damage has occurred, the arthritis is irreversible and tends to progress despite adequate control of GH secretion, although there may be large variations between individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In this setting, standard measures for the treatment of any degenerative arthropathy apply, including medications for pain relief, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and, if necessary, joint replacement. Weight control is also advised, as a higher body mass index (BMI) is associated with the progression of lower-limb OA in acromegalic patients in remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Intraarticular glucocorticoid injection appears to be ineffective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It is important to assess routinely for musculoskeletal problems in acromegaly and to provide appropriate multidisciplinary treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carpal tunnel syndrome is common in acromegaly. Up to one-third of patients have median nerve compression, which is frequently bilateral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These findings are due to soft tissue enlargement (synovial edema and tendon hyperplasia). Correction of the acromegaly usually leads to rapid resolution of symptoms, unlike established arthropathy, although 18 percent of patients in one series required surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome during the course of their disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, in a series of 58 patients with longstanding acromegaly, in which musculoskeletal symptoms were specifically addressed, 17 percent were found to have had previous carpal tunnel decompression, and 40 percent had had symptoms of carpal tunnel at diagnosis. Symptoms were present at the time of the study in 31 percent, with 20 percent showing evidence of median nerve compression by Tinel's or Phalen's test. The authors of the study suggested that carpal tunnel syndrome may be a longer-term problem requiring further treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peripheral neuropathy occurs in approximately one-half of acromegalic patients and may contribute to muscle weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The nerve damage may be due to the acromegaly itself and to concurrent diabetes mellitus, which develops in 30 percent of cases. The component due to acromegaly appears to involve segmental demyelination without evidence of axonal degeneration; there is eventual irreversible hypertrophy of the Schwann cell system of the small diameter fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Peripheral nerve enlargement (median, ulnar) can be detected by ultrasound and appears to be related to disease control, to insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels, and to duration of acromegaly. The enlargement of the nerves is not confined to potential entrapment areas (cubital, carpal tunnel) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. While nerve cross-sectional area decreases with successful treatment over a one-year follow-up period, nerves still remain larger than controls. Reduction in nerve enlargement is proportional to the degree of disease control, particularly levels of IGF-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">BONE DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Growth hormone (GH) is involved in the regulation of bone turnover and remodeling, probably both directly and indirectly via the production of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Excess GH secretion results in increased bone turnover, as demonstrated histologically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] and by studies using biochemical markers of bone metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. It has been suggested that the action of GH on bone turnover in acromegaly may be mediated via parathyroid hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Although acromegaly is associated with vertebral fractures and was considered a cause of osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], subsequent studies have found inconsistent results concerning the relationship between acromegaly and bone density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/29,30,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30,33-35</a>]. These differences may relate to the sites at which bone mineral density (BMD) was measured, to the duration and activity of acromegaly, or to the presence of hypogonadism; the last factor may be the most important in both men and women. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among eugonadal patients, forearm and hip BMDs are preserved or are even enhanced, and they may be higher than those among hypogonadal acromegalic patients or control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/33,35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,35-39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypogonadal patients with acromegaly have a lower BMD as measured in the spine than eugonadal patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/34,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,39</a>]; vertebral BMD appears to depend more upon gonadal status than acromegalic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/33,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients with acromegaly have a lumbar BMD similar to that of controls, although some hypogonadal patients may be osteopenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/33-37,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-37,40,41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pituitary irradiation may be a strong negative predictor of bone mass. This has been hypothesized to be due to reduced GH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p>Changes in BMD and bone turnover in acromegaly have been extensively studied, and an increase in vertebral fractures has been reported in most studies, although data regarding fractures in other locations are very limited. The following findings illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one series of 206 surgically treated patients, fracture risk appeared to be reduced prior to diagnosis, and a trend was still seen toward a decrease in fracture risk after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, a small cross-sectional study of 36 postmenopausal women with acromegaly showed 19 (53 percent) to have radiological vertebral fractures, with a significantly higher fracture rate in those with active compared with controlled disease, although fractures tended to be less severe in the active group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Only 25 percent of those with vertebral fracture and active acromegaly were osteoporotic (T score &lt;-2.5) compared with 57 percent of those with controlled acromegaly and vertebral fracture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 40 acromegalic men showed a significantly greater prevalence of vertebral fractures than controls, who were matched for age and gonadal status (57.5 versus 22.6 percent). Bone mineral density was not significantly different between acromegalic patients and controls. Acromegalic patients with fractures had significantly higher IGF-1 values and a longer duration of active disease than acromegalic patients without fractures, as well as longer duration of untreated hypogonadism. The duration of active acromegaly was the only risk factor significantly correlated with fracture occurrence in a multivariate logistic regression analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 89 patients (46 percent male) with controlled acromegaly showed a high prevalence of vertebral fractures (59 percent) with a mean number of 3.4 fractures per person in those who had fractured. Fractures were more common in men (64 percent), and there was no relationship between the presence or absence of fractures and BMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Hypogonadal men had a significantly higher prevalence of vertebral fractures than eugonadal or hypogonadal women.</p><p/><p>A 2015 meta-analysis of 41 studies involving 1935 patients found that acromegalic patients had higher bone formation and resorption than controls, without significant differences in lumbar BMD, although femoral neck BMD was higher in acromegalic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Patients with acromegaly had an eightfold risk of vertebral fracture compared with controls, and those with active disease had three times the risk of vertebral fracture compared with those with controlled disease. Male gender and hypogonadism were associated with a higher frequency of fractures.</p><p>Two prospective studies showed that vertebral fractures can progress in 20 to 25 percent of patients with controlled acromegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. In both studies, prevalent vertebral fractures at baseline were a risk factor for progression. In one study, hypogonadism and a falling femoral neck BMD were associated with further vertebral fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], while in the other study vertebral fractures were not related to BMD changes over time and were more common in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. There were insufficient hypogonadal patients in the latter study to assess contribution to risk.</p><p>Possible explanations have been offered for both reduced and increased fracture rates in active disease. The former has been ascribed to the anabolic effects of excess GH on bone mineral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], and the latter has been postulated to be due to impaired bone quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Deterioration in trabecular bone microarchitecture may explain the absence of osteoporosis in some patients with vertebral fractures and acromegaly.</p><p>Acromegaly had an adverse effect on trabecular bone microarchitecture in a study involving 82 acromegalic patients; in this study, BMD and bone microarchitecture were evaluated using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Overall, hypogonadism was the most important determinant of both BMD and microarchitecture, but when eugonadal acromegalic patients were compared with normal controls, lower indices of trabecular microarchitecture were found at the distal tibia in acromegalic patients, despite similar BMD results using DXA. </p><p>Two nationwide studies, in Holland and Denmark, examined fracture risk in patients with acromegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/7,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,50</a>]. In the Dutch registry study, patients with previous acromegaly receiving growth hormone had an increased fracture risk after six years of growth hormone replacement treatment, while the Danish cohort study showed no increase in fracture rate in acromegalics. The authors of both studies felt that the incidence of vertebral fractures, which may be asymptomatic, could have been underestimated in these studies.</p><p>Degenerative disease and bone size may affect assessment of BMD by DXA, and as vertebral fractures have been reported independent of BMD, DXA may not be helpful in assessing fracture risk in people with acromegaly. FRAX has also been shown not to be helpful in identifying patients with acromegaly with vertebral fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. A consensus statement has suggested that thoracic and lumbar spine radiographs may be useful for diagnosing vertebral fractures, and acromegalic patients should be assessed for osteoporosis risk factors such as vitamin D deficiency, inadequate calcium intake, hyperparathyroidism, glucocorticoid over-replacement, and hypogonadism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>In patients with vertebral fractures we treat as we would for osteoporosis in the absence of acromegaly, although the efficacy and safety of bone active drugs have not been studied in acromegaly. Adequate control of acromegaly and treatment of hypogonadism is also important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Arthropathy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main manifestations of the arthropathy in acromegaly include joint pain, particularly on activity. Joint swelling and tightness, crepitus, effusions, and hyperlaxity of the joints and spine may occur. Spinal pain is common, and kyphoscoliosis may be seen. The peripheral joints most commonly affected are the knee and shoulder. Axial involvement may affect any portion of the spine but is most common in the lumbar region, and features of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) may be present. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The radiographic changes of the arthropathy in acromegaly vary according to the stage of the arthropathy. Widening of joint spaces due to cartilage overgrowth and thickening of the soft tissues occurs in the early stages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F64058\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64058 \">image 1</a>), progressing to osteophyte formation, cartilage loss, and degenerative joint disease, which is eventually indistinguishable from OA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F82074\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82074 \">image 2</a>). In addition, thickening of the heel pad is often seen. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The symptoms of the arthropathy and much of the cartilaginous thickening may improve with treatment of the acromegaly. In many patients, however, symptoms persist, and, once bone damage has occurred, the arthritis is irreversible and tends to progress despite adequate control of GH secretion. In this setting, standard measures for the treatment of any degenerative arthropathy apply. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Treatment and prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carpal tunnel syndrome is common in acromegaly, in which it is due to soft tissue enlargement (synovial edema and tendon hyperplasia). Correction of the acromegaly usually leads to rapid resolution of symptoms, unlike established arthropathy, although symptoms can be sustained. Additional intervention may be required. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Carpal tunnel syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral neuropathy can occur and may contribute to muscle weakness. The nerve damage may be due to the acromegaly itself and to concurrent diabetes mellitus. Peripheral nerve enlargement can be detected by ultrasound and appears to be related to disease control, IGF-1 levels, and duration of acromegaly. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Peripheral neuropathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone mineral density may not reflect vertebral fracture risk in acromegaly, and hypogonadism is an important determinant of bone mineral density, bone microarchitecture, and fracture risk in this disease. FRAX does not reflect vertebral fracture risk in acromegaly, and plain radiographs of thoracic and lumbar spine should be performed if the acromegalic patient is thought to be at risk of vertebral fractures. Treatment is as for the treatment of osteoporosis, although data are lacking on the efficacy of bone active drugs in acromegaly. It is important to control the acromegaly and treat hypogonadism. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Bone disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The arthropathy of acromegaly has a significant impact on quality of life. It is important to assess routinely for musculoskeletal problems and to provide appropriate multidisciplinary treatment.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lieberman SA, Bj&ouml;rkengren AG, Hoffman AR.
