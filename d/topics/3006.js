The cast or splint will reduce your pain and protect your bone as it heals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95781501\"><span class=\"h1\">Why is it important to take care of a cast or splint?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to take care of a cast or splint so that the skin under the cast doesn't get hurt or infected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95781508\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I get my cast wet?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on what kind of cast you have. Your doctor will tell you if you have a waterproof cast that can get wet. Otherwise, you should <strong>not</strong> get your cast wet.</p><p>To keep your cast dry when you bathe, cover it with two plastic bags, and tape each bag &ndash; separately &ndash; to your skin with duct tape (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F97288\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97288 \">picture 1</a>). Then keep your cast outside the tub or shower when you wash your body. In young children, use a rubber band at the top of each plastic bag instead of tape. For them, removing the tape from the skin would hurt too much. Some people buy a waterproof cast cover to use when bathing. If you use a waterproof cast cover, it&rsquo;s still a good idea to keep your cast outside the tub or shower. These covers are not completely waterproof.</p><p>If your cast gets wet, you can dry it with a hair dryer set to the cool setting. Do not use a warm or hot setting, because those settings can burn the skin. You can also use a vacuum cleaner that has a hose to help dry your cast. Put the hose next to your cast so that you suck wet air out of the cast.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95781515\"><span class=\"h1\">What are other ways I can take care of my cast?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To take care of your cast, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your cast clean and avoid getting dirt or sand inside it</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not put anything inside your cast</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not put powder or lotion on the skin near your cast</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not pull the lining out from inside the cast</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cover your cast when you eat, so that it doesn't get dirty</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95781522\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I have pain under my cast during the first few days?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have pain during the first few days, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put ice on the cast &ndash; Use a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time. Put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your cast raised (for example, on pillows) to help reduce swelling &ndash; To reduce swelling and pain, your cast needs to be raised above the level of your heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take medicine to relieve your pain &ndash; If your doctor prescribed pain-relieving medicine, you can take that. You can also ask your doctor or nurse about taking over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen (sample brand name: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95781529\"><span class=\"h1\">What if the skin under my cast itches?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your skin itches, you can use a hair dryer set to the cool setting to blow air inside the cast.
