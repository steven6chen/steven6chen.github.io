The diagnosis is typically reserved for pregnancies over 20 weeks of gestation. The major clinical findings are vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain, often accompanied by hypertonic uterine contractions, uterine tenderness, and a nonreassuring fetal heart rate (FHR) pattern. </p><p>Abruption is a significant cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity, and perinatal mortality. The perinatal mortality rate is approximately 20-fold higher in comparison to pregnancies without abruption (12 percent versus 0.6 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The majority of perinatal deaths (up to 77 percent) occur in utero; deaths in the postnatal period are primarily related to preterm delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. However, perinatal mortality associated with abruption appears to be decreasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Placental abruption complicates approximately 1 percent of pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], with two-thirds classified as severe due to accompanying maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The incidence appears to be increasing in the United States, Canada, and several Nordic countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], possibly due to increases in the prevalence of risk factors for the disorder <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to changes in case ascertainment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p>In one review, 40 to 60 percent of abruptions occurred before 37 weeks of gestation and 14 percent occurred before 32 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, gestational age-specific incidence rates vary considerably depending on the etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immediate cause of the premature placental separation is rupture of maternal vessels in the decidua basalis, where it interfaces with the anchoring villi of the placenta. Rarely, the bleeding originates from the fetal-placental vessels. The accumulating blood splits the decidua, separating a thin layer of decidua with its placental attachment from the uterus. The bleed may be small and self-limited, or may continue to dissect through the placental-decidual interface, leading to complete or near complete placental separation. The detached portion of the placenta is unable to exchange gases and nutrients; when the remaining fetoplacental unit is unable to compensate for this loss of function, the fetus becomes compromised.</p><p>The etiology of bleeding at the decidua basalis remains speculative in most cases, despite extensive clinical and epidemiologic research. A small proportion of all abruptions are related to sudden mechanical events, such as blunt abdominal trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] or rapid uterine decompression, which cause shearing of the inelastic placenta due to sudden stretching or contraction of the underlying uterine wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In motor vehicle crashes, an additional factor is rapid acceleration-deceleration of the uterus, which causes uterine stretch without concomitant placental stretch, leading to a shearing force between the placenta and the uterine wall. Although even minor trauma may be associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, severe maternal trauma is associated with a six-fold increased risk of abruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Uterine abnormalities, cocaine use, and smoking are additional less common causes of abruption. Uterine anomalies (eg, bicornuate uterus), uterine synechiae, and leiomyoma are mechanically and biologically unstable sites for placental implantation; abruption at these sites may be due to inadequate decidualization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shear. Suboptimal trophoblastic implantation may also explain the increased risk of abruption among women with a prior cesarean (odds ratio [OR] 2.3, 95% CI 1.5-3.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The pathophysiological effect of cocaine in the genesis of abruption is unknown, but may be related to cocaine-induced vasoconstriction leading to ischemia, reflex vasodilatation, and disruption of vascular integrity. As many as 10 percent of women using cocaine in the third trimester will develop placental abruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. The mechanism(s) that underlie the relationship between smoking cigarettes and abruption also remains unclear. One hypothesis is that the vasoconstrictive effects of smoking cause placental hypoperfusion, which could result in decidual ischemia, necrosis, and hemorrhage leading to premature placental separation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Most abruptions appear to be related to a chronic placental disease process. In these cases, abnormalities in the early development of the spiral arteries lead to decidual necrosis, placental inflammation and possibly infarction, and ultimately vascular disruption and bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,12,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,21-23</a>]. High pressure arterial hemorrhage in the central area of the placenta leads to rapid development of potentially life-threatening clinical manifestations of abruption (eg, severe bleeding, maternal disseminated intravascular coagulation, fetal heart rate [FHR] abnormalities). Low pressure venous hemorrhage, typically at the periphery of the placenta (marginal abruption), is more likely to result in clinical manifestations that occur over time (eg, light intermittent bleeding, oligohydramnios, and fetal growth restriction associated with redistribution of cerebral blood flow [decrease in the middle cerebral artery pulsatility index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]]).</p><p>Thrombin plays a key role in the clinical consequences of placental abruption, and may be important in its pathogenesis, as well. It is formed via two pathways: in one pathway, decidual bleeding leads to release of tissue factor (thromboplastin) from decidual cells, which generates thrombin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In the other pathway, decidual hypoxia induces production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which acts directly on decidual endothelial cells to induce aberrant expression of tissue factor, which then generates thrombin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The production of thrombin can lead to the following clinical sequelae:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine hypertonus and contractions, as thrombin is a potent, direct uterotonic agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhanced expression of matrix metalloproteinases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28</a>], up-regulation of genes involved in apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], and induced expression of inflammatory cytokines (predominantly interleukin-8), leading to tissue necrosis and degradation of extracellular matrix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29,30</a>]. A vicious cycle then ensues, resulting in further vascular disruption, and often leading to initiation of labor and rupture of membranes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54747\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54747 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In women with premature rupture of membranes, the risk of placental abruption increases with increasing latency, which suggests that inflammation subsequent to membrane rupture can induce rather than result from the cascade of events leading to placental separation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-35</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Triggering of coagulation. If a massive amount of tissue factor (thromboplastin) is released, a massive amount of thrombin is generated and enters the maternal circulation over a brief period of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This overwhelms hemostatic control mechanisms, without allowing sufficient time for recovery of compensatory mechanisms. The clinical consequence is a profound systemic bleeding diathesis and, due to widespread intravascular fibrin deposition, ischemic tissue injury and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (ie, disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional progesterone withdrawal by reduced expression of progesterone receptors in decidual cells, which initiates or contributes to uterine contractility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9294247\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Previous abruption is the strongest risk factor for abruption, with recurrence risks of 10- to 15-fold higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], and as high as 93-fold higher (95% CI 62-139) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Other major risk factors in singleton and twin gestations are described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75801\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75801 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Smoking is one of the few modifiable risk factors for abruption: it is associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of abruption severe enough to result in fetal death and the risk increases by 40 percent for each pack per day smoked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The combination of cigarette smoking and hypertension has a synergistic effect on risk of abruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Hypertensive women have a five-fold increased risk of severe abruption compared to normotensive women, and antihypertensive therapy does not appear to reduce the risk of placental abruption among women with chronic hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Vitamin C-E supplementation appeared to mitigate the risk of abruption among smokers in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], but this finding must be cautiously interpreted given the small number of events and wide confidence interval.</p><p>A modest increase in the risk of abruption has also been noted in women with asthma (adjusted OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.09-1.36) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The sisters of women who have had an abruption appear to be at increased risk of also having an abruption (odds ratio 1.7 to 2.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. A case-control study noted that pregnancies complicated by abruption were almost twice as likely to be associated with major fetal congenital anomalies than pregnancies without abruption (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.6-2.52), especially when the fetus was growth restricted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>Evidence of an association between elevated thyroperoxidase antibodies and hypothyroidism in relation to abruption has also been reported. For example, one study reported that placental abruption was present more often among women with subclinical hypothyroidism compared with euthyroid controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, most women with abruption are not affected, these diagnoses are not highly predictive of abruption, and there is no evidence that treatment of asymptomatic patients will reduce the risk of abruption. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment#H821274\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypothyroidism during pregnancy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Pregnancy complications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute abruption</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9295986\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with an acute abruption classically present with the abrupt onset of vaginal bleeding, mild to moderate abdominal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> back pain, and uterine contractions. Back pain is prominent when the placenta is on the posterior wall of the uterus. The uterus is often firm, and may be rigid and tender. </p><p>Contractions are usually high frequency and low amplitude, but a contraction pattern typical of labor is also possible and labor may proceed rapidly. </p><p>Vaginal bleeding ranges from mild and clinically insignificant to severe and life-threatening. Blood loss may be underestimated because bleeding may be retained behind the placenta and thus difficult to quantify. The amount of vaginal bleeding correlates poorly with the degree of placental separation and does not serve as a useful marker of impending fetal or maternal risk. Abdominal pain is a better predictor of poor outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Maternal hypotension and fetal heart rate (FHR) abnormalities suggest clinically significant separation that could result in fetal death and severe maternal morbidity. When placental separation exceeds 50 percent, acute disseminated intravascular coagulation and fetal death are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].</p><p>In 10 to 20 percent of placental abruptions, patients present with only preterm labor, and no or scant vaginal bleeding. In these cases, termed &quot;concealed abruption,&quot; all or most of the blood is trapped between the fetal membranes and decidua, rather than escaping through the cervix and vagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Therefore, in pregnant women with abdominal pain and uterine contractions, even a small amount of vaginal bleeding should prompt close maternal and fetal evaluation for placental abruption. In other cases, a small concealed abruption may be asymptomatic and only recognized as an incidental finding on an ultrasound.</p><p>Occasionally, the signs and symptoms of abruption develop after rapid uterine decompression, such as after uncontrolled rupture of membranes in the setting of polyhydramnios or after delivery of a first twin. Signs and symptoms of abruption also may occur after maternal abdominal trauma or a motor vehicle crash. In these cases, placental abruption generally presents within 24 hours of the precipitating event and tends to be severe. The clinical presentation and obstetrical evaluation of pregnant trauma victims are described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women-with-major-trauma#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of pregnant women with major trauma&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation and management of major trauma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600214\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree of maternal hemorrhage correlates with the degree of hematological abnormality; fibrinogen levels have the best correlation with severity of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], overt disseminated intravascular coagulation, and the need for transfusion of multiple blood products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Initial fibrinogen values of &le;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> are reported to have 100 percent positive predictive value for severe postpartum hemorrhage, while levels of &ge;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> have a negative predictive value of 79 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Mild <span class=\"nowrap\">separation/hemorrhage</span> may not be associated with any abnormalities of commonly used tests of hemostasis. </p><p>Severe abruption can lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC occurs in 10 to 20 percent of severe abruptions with death of the fetus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of acute DIC is confirmed by demonstrating increased thrombin generation (eg, decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (eg, elevated fibrin degradation products [FDPs] and D-dimer). However, laboratory findings suggestive of mild DIC need to be interpreted with caution in pregnancy because of normal pregnancy-related increases in the concentration of almost all coagulation factors and a normal mild decrease in platelet count. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Hematologic changes&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The Kleihauer-Betke test is positive in a small proportion of abruptions. There is poor correlation between the results of this test and the presence or absence of abruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49,54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,54-56</a>] with a sensitivity of only 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Even prior to clinical or sonographic findings of abruption, there may be early markers of ischemic placental disease detected during routine prenatal care. Abnormalities of maternal serum aneuploidy analytes (eg, increased alpha fetoprotein or human chorionic gonadotropin, decreased pregnancy-associated plasma protein A or unconjugated estriol not explained by fetal abnormalities) carry up to a 10-fold risk of subsequent abruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/58-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-63</a>]. Data also suggest that a low fetal fraction identified during first-trimester cell-free fetal DNA aneuploidy screening has a 2.5-fold increased risk of composite obstetrical morbidity, including placental abruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Ongoing investigation on early maternal serum metabolomics and placenta-specific microRNAs may yield information on the biomarkers of placental abruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600443\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identification of a retroplacental hematoma is the classic ultrasound finding of placental abruption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83126\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83126 \">image 1</a>). Retroplacental hematomas have a variable appearance; they can appear solid, complex, and hypo-, hyper-, or iso-echoic compared to the placenta. Hypoechogenicity and sonolucency are features of resolving rather than acute hematomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83127\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83127 \">image 2</a>). </p><p>Sonographic findings consistent with placental abruption are associated with the worse maternal and perinatal outcomes. However, whether a hematoma is identified depends on the extent of hemorrhage, chronicity of the bleeding, and extent that blood has escaped through the cervix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72314%7EOBGYN%2F51286\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72314 graphicRef51286 \">image 3A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69163%7EOBGYN%2F79004\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69163 graphicRef79004 \">image 4A-B</a>).

The sensitivity of ultrasound findings for diagnosis of abruption is only 25 to 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/68-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-71</a>], but the positive predictive value is high (88 percent) when ultrasound findings suggestive of abruption are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/68,69,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69,72</a>].</p><p>A thorough search for other findings in symptomatic patients may improve the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound.

A retroplacental hematoma is the classic ultrasound finding and strongly supports the clinical diagnosis, but is absent in many patients with abruption. </p><p>Postpartum, the absence of characteristic placental findings does not exclude the diagnosis.

The onset of labor (preterm or term) is characterized by mild uterine contractions at infrequent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> irregular intervals; the contractions become more regular and painful over time and are accompanied by cervical dilation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> effacement. Mucus that has accumulated in the cervix may be discharged as clear, pink, or slightly bloody secretions (ie, mucus plug, bloody show), sometimes several days before labor begins. Early labor is usually associated with less bleeding, less uterine rigidity, less abdominal pain, and fewer high frequency contractions compared with abruption; however, there is an overlap in symptoms since abruption may trigger labor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-preterm-labor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of preterm labor&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The characteristic clinical presentation of placenta previa is painless vaginal bleeding after 20 weeks of gestation; however, 10 to 20 percent of women present with uterine contractions associated with the bleeding. Thus, abruption and placenta previa can be difficult to distinguish clinically since abruption may not be associated with significant pain and placenta previa may not be painless. In pregnant women with vaginal bleeding, an ultrasound examination should be performed to determine whether placenta previa is the source. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placenta-previa-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-morbidity-and-mortality\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placenta previa: Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, morbidity and mortality&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Uterine rupture is most common in women with a prior hysterotomy. Signs of uterine rupture may include the sudden onset fetal heart rate (FHR) abnormalities, vaginal bleeding, constant abdominal pain, cessation of uterine contractions, recession of the presenting part, and maternal hypotension and tachycardia. Many of these symptoms are common to abruption because uterine rupture often leads to placental separation.
