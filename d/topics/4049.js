However, translocations involving the TCR genes in PTCLs are much less frequent than translocations involving the Ig genes in B cell lymphomas. This is likely due to the fact that mature B cells continue to diversify their Ig genes in germinal centers through somatic hypermutation and class switching, events that are prone to errors that can result in translocations, whereas the TCR genes of mature T cells are genomically stable and presumably much less likely to participate in oncogenic rearrangements.</p><p>Efforts are underway to use genomic profiling and other techniques to further divide this heterogeneous group of tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma-not-otherwise-specified/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. Gene expression profiles (GEPs) of PTCL, NOS are clearly distinct from resting normal T cells, and are most closely related to activated CD4+ or CD8+ peripheral T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma-not-otherwise-specified/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Two subgroups of PTCL, NOS, with distinct gene expression profiles driven by the transcription factors TBX-21 or GATA-3, which normally play a role in the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into TH1 and TH2 helper cells, respectively, have been also described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma-not-otherwise-specified/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

In many instances, the histologic features are sufficiently atypical (eg, complete nodal effacement by atypical lymphoid cells) that a diagnosis of lymphoma can be made with certainty, but evaluation of the immunophenotype by either immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry is essential to confirm the T cell origin of the tumor. Immunohistochemistry is more reliable, because large lymphoid cells are sometimes lost or disrupted during tissue processing required for performance of flow cytometry.</p><p>The immunophenotype of PTCL, NOS varies greatly from case to case, but always demonstrates expression of one or more of the pan-T antigens (ie, CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7). Roughly half of cases demonstrate an aberrant immunophenotype, defined by the loss of a pan-T cell antigen that is expressed by most normal mature T cells (eg, CD5 or CD7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma-not-otherwise-specified/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Detection of surface CD3 (best assessed by flow cytometry) can also be helpful, since this finding excludes rare lymphomas of natural killer cell origin. In difficult or equivocal cases, molecular detection of a clonal T cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement, performed using a PCR-based assay, can be very helpful. While the majority of PTCL, NOS has cytogenetic abnormalities, none are specific.</p><p>Because PTCL, NOS is a heterogeneous category and essentially a diagnosis of exclusion, the diagnostic agreement rate among expert hematopathologists is only about 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma-not-otherwise-specified/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

ALCL demonstrates homogeneous, strong expression of CD30 in a membrane and golgi pattern. T cell antigens are also commonly expressed.</p><p>A proportion of PTCL, NOS tumors express CD30 in a subset of cells, but not in the diffuse pattern typical of ALCL. ALCL is often positive for epithelial membrane antigen and ALK, the latter due to the presence of ALK gene rearrangements, all of which are absent from PTCL, NOS.

The malignant cell of origin in ATL is a transformed HTLV-I infected mature helper (CD4+) T-lymphocyte. Nodal ATL cannot be reliably distinguished from PTCL, NOS on morphologic or immunophenotypic grounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma-not-otherwise-specified/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and can only be excluded with certainty if HTLV-I studies (generally serology) are negative, particularly in patients from regions where HTLV-1 is endemic.

In THRLBCL, the tumor cells are a minor fraction of the total cellularity, which consists mainly of reactive T cells and histiocytes. Distinction from PTCL, NOS is usually not difficult, as the malignant B cells in THRLBCL express pan B cell markers (eg, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a), and will usually show IgH gene rearrangements.

The most important clue is careful morphologic inspection of lymphoid cells, which usually show a significant degree of cytologic atypia in PTCL, NOS. Difficult cases can be distinguished by immunophenotyping and polymerase chain reaction-based assays of T cell receptor rearrangements, which usually reveal a polyclonal pattern in granulomatous lymphadenitis. Care must be taken not to over-interpret a dominant clone within a reactive T cell expansion in small biopsy specimens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Paracortical hyperplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some cases of PTCL, NOS demonstrate a perifollicular (T-zone) growth pattern that is similar to that seen in benign paracortical hyperplasias, which in certain immune reactions may include a high fraction of large, rapidly-dividing T immunoblasts that simulate the appearance of lymphoma (eg, in responses to viral infections such as acute mononucleosis). Unlike PTCL, NOS, the T cells in benign hyperplasias have normal immunophenotypes and are typically polyclonal when tested by polymerase chain reaction-based assays, lacking the clonal T cell receptor rearrangements that are seen in PTCL, NOS.
