The clinical syndrome is characterized by the development of dyspnea, which is commonly associated with the rapid accumulation of fluid within the lung's interstitial and alveolar spaces due to acutely elevated cardiac filling pressures (cardiogenic pulmonary edema) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nesiritide-in-the-treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Acute decompensated HF can also present as elevated left ventricular filling pressures and dyspnea without pulmonary edema. In many cases, the elevation in filling pressures and the associated dyspnea are gradually progressive or subacute in nature and are often superimposed on a background of chronic HF.</p><p>Multiple modalities are used in the treatment of acute decompensated HF, including oxygen, diuretics, vasodilators, and, in selected patients, inotropic agents. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nesiritide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nesiritide</a> (recombinant human brain natriuretic peptide, BNP 1-32) is a vasodilator that has undergone clinical trials in patients with acute HF.</p><p>The possible role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nesiritide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nesiritide</a> in the management of acute decompensated HF will be reviewed here. General issues related to the management of acute decompensated HF, the pathophysiology and evaluation of patients with this disorder, and the management of chronic systolic and diastolic HF are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-general-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: General considerations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute decompensated heart failure in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are increased in patients with HF, such patients are sodium avid and have increased systemic vascular resistance. This apparent paradox likely reflects the fact that the natriuretic peptide system alone is not able to compensate fully for the factors that drive sodium avidity and vasoconstriction such as activation of neurohumoral systems including the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of heart failure: Neurohumoral adaptations&quot;</a>). Another factor may be the lack of specificity of commercially available immunoreactive-BNP assays that measure inactive as well as active forms; bioactive BNP 1-32 levels may be low in patients with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nesiritide-in-the-treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nesiritide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nesiritide</a> is a balanced vasodilator that acts on arteries to decrease systemic vascular resistance and thereby lowers left ventricular afterload, and acts on veins to increase venous capacitance and thereby lowers left and right heart failing pressures. The rationale for the use of nesiritide is based on these hemodynamic effects. </p><p>Infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nesiritide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nesiritide</a> at doses of up to 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per min in patients with HF can raise the mean plasma BNP concentration from 700 to 13,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> with associated arterial and venous vasodilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nesiritide-in-the-treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The hemodynamic effects of nesiritide are consistent from patient to patient and independent of baseline levels of BNP, indicating that the natriuretic peptide system has substantial vasodilator capacity beyond the effects of the endogenous peptide levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL TRIALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical trials found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nesiritide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nesiritide</a> acutely reduced pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and dyspnea in patients with acute decompensated HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nesiritide-in-the-treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, the largest randomized controlled trial found that nesiritide only slightly reduced dyspnea (with borderline significance), did not alter rates of death or rehospitalization, and significantly increased rates of hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nesiritide-in-the-treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect on hemodynamics and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two studies demonstrated the acute hemodynamic effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nesiritide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nesiritide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nesiritide-in-the-treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In the larger study, 489 patients, including 246 who underwent pulmonary artery catheterization, were assigned to nesiritide, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a>, or placebo for three hours, followed by nesiritide or intravenous nitroglycerin for 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nesiritide-in-the-treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Nesiritide decreased the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure significantly more than either intravenous nitroglycerin or placebo at three hours (5.8 versus 3.8 and 2.0 mmHg) and significantly more than nitroglycerin at 24 hours (8.2 versus 6.3 mmHg). However, the dose of nitroglycerin given tended to be less than that used clinically. Dyspnea was reduced and global clinical status was improved when compared with placebo, but there was no significant difference for either parameter compared with intravenous nitroglycerin.</p><p>In the largest randomized placebo-controlled trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nesiritide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nesiritide</a> in acute HF (Acute Study of Clinical Effectiveness of Nesiritide and Decompensated Heart Failure [ASCEND-HF], n = 7141), nesiritide produced only a small improvement in dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nesiritide-in-the-treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Nesiritide was administered as 0.010 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/min</span> for 24 hours or more for up to seven days (preceded by an initial recommended but optional bolus of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg)</span>. Findings included the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nesiritide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nesiritide</a> slightly increased the frequency of markedly or moderately improved dyspnea at six hours (44.5 versus 42.1 percent, p = 0.03) and 24 hours (68.2 versus 66.1 percent, p = 0.007). This small improvement was significant according to the prespecified level required by the European Medicine Agency (p&le;0.05 for both assessments or p&le;0.025 for either) but did not meet the prespecified level for significance required by United States regulators because of the multiple comparisons performed in the trial (p&le;0.005 for both assessments or p&le;0.0025 for either). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotension was significantly more frequent in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nesiritide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nesiritide</a> group compared with the placebo group (26.6 versus 15.3 percent).

Independent predictors of urine output included diuretic dose, higher diastolic blood pressure, elevated jugular venous pressure, and lower blood urea nitrogen. </p><p/><p>Similar results were obtained in the smaller Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation (ROSE) trial, which randomly assigned 360 patients with acute HF to low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nesiritide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nesiritide</a> (0.005 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/min</span> without bolus for 72 h), low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/min</span> for 72 h), or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nesiritide-in-the-treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

There is no evidence for improved renal function and data are conflicting on whether there is a modest natriuresis and diuresis with nesiritide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nesiritide-in-the-treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure/abstract/3,4,11,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,11,13,14</a>].</p><p>Concern for risk of renal dysfunction was raised by a meta-analysis that included 1269 patients with HF treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nesiritide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nesiritide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nesiritide-in-the-treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], but no effect on renal function was found in the ASCEND-HF trial. The ASCEND-HF trial of nesiritide versus placebo in 7141 patients with acute HF found that nesiritide therapy (continuous infusion at 0.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">microg/kg</span> per min with an initial loading dose of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">microg/kg</span> at the investigator&rsquo;s discretion) did not increase or decrease the risk of worsening renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nesiritide-in-the-treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Similarly, the ROSE trial found no significant effect on renal function (as assessed by change in cystatin C level) with low-dose nesiritide (0.005 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/min</span> without bolus for 72 h) or low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/min</span> for 72 h) compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nesiritide-in-the-treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>The effect of vasodilators generally on renal function is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment#H17931536\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiorenal syndrome: Prognosis and treatment&quot;, section on 'Vasodilators'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The available evidence does <strong>not</strong> support <strong>routine</strong> use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nesiritide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nesiritide</a> in patients hospitalized with acute decompensated HF. We recommend against the routine use of nesiritide in such patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-components-of-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: Components of therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In carefully selected patients hospitalized with acute HF with appropriate hemodynamics (without hypotension or cardiogenic shock) who remain symptomatic despite routine therapy, a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nesiritide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nesiritide</a> may be helpful as an alternative to other vasodilator therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a>). As noted above, in one study, nesiritide produced greater reductions in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure compared with low doses of intravenous nitroglycerin, although the effect on symptoms was similar (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Effect on hemodynamics and symptoms'</a> above). The relative merits of nesiritide in relation to other intravenous agents for HF (vasodilators such as nitroprusside and nitroglycerin or other agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milrinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milrinone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a>) remain uncertain. Nesiritide has less toxicity than nitroprusside, which may lead to cyanide or thiocyanide toxicity in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function. Nesiritide is a balanced vasodilator and thus exerts more afterload reduction than nitroglycerin, which is predominantly a venous dilator. Nesiritide has a longer effective half-life than nitroglycerin or nitroprusside, so hypotension may persist longer.</p><p>If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nesiritide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nesiritide</a> is used, close monitoring of hemodynamics, urine output, and renal function is necessary.

The dose is increased if, after 3 to 24 hours, the desired therapeutic response (an increase in urine output, symptomatic improvement, and, in invasively monitored patients, a reduction in cardiac filling pressures) is not achieved. When an increased dose is necessary, the infusion is usually increased by 0.005 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per min, preceded by a bolus of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg,</span> up to a maximum of 0.03 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per min. </p><p>If symptomatic hypotension occurs, the infusion should be discontinued or the dose decreased.</p><p>There is no need for dose adjustment for renal dysfunction.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nesiritide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nesiritide</a> infusion at any dose can be discontinued without tapering.
