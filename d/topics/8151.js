Hepatitis B immunization in infants, children, and adolescents will be discussed here, focusing on immunization of infants, children, and adolescents (&lt;18 years) in the United States. Our recommendations are generally consistent with those of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><p>HBV infection in children and adolescents and Hepatitis B immunization in adults (&ge;18 years) are discussed separately.

The viral particle is composed of an outer lipoprotein envelope, which contains hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and an inner nucleocapsid, which consists of hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-immunization-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>HBV can be transmitted vertically from mother to infant during labor or delivery, through sexual intercourse, or by exposure to contaminated blood or body fluids. In utero transmission is uncommon. Infants born to HBsAg-positive women are at increased risk of HBV infection. Adolescents also are at increased risk as a result of sexual behavior or injection drug use.
