One study (n = 100 pregnant women) showed that elevated levels of placental corticotropin-releasing hormone at 25 weeks gestational age were a strong predictor of postpartum depression at an average of nine weeks after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].

The enzyme metabolizes neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, and more rapid depletion of these neurotransmitters may lead to depression.

In addition, screening for depression is consistent with guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>], and the American Academy of Pediatrics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. The rationale for screening is that postnatal depression is serious, prevalent, under-recognized, and treatable, and that standardized, valid screening tools are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The most widely used instrument to screen postpartum women for major depression is the self-report, 10-item Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67741%7EOBGYN%2F81407\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67741 graphicRef81407 \">figure 1A-B</a>), which can be completed in less than five minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>].

Responses to items are scored 0, 1, 2, or 3, with a maximum score of 30; scores &ge;12 or 13 identify most women with postpartum major depression. However, many studies have used a cutoff score of &ge;10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. The test performance is generally good to excellent; in a systematic review that included 11 studies (which screened more than 3000 postpartum women), a cutoff of 12 yielded sensitivities and specificities that ranged from 80 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>]. The specificity is enhanced because the instrument does not include items that ask about somatic depressive symptoms such as changes in sleep and appetite, which are common in postpartum women who are not depressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A reasonable alternative to the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is the self-report, nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,134,142\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,134,142</a>].</p><p>A reasonable alternative to a screening tool is to ask questions such as, &quot;During the last month, have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?&quot; and &quot;During the last month, have you often been bothered by having little interest or pleasure in doing things?&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/137,141\" class=\"abstract_t\">137,141</a>]. For patients who endorse dysphoria or anhedonia, follow-up questions can better define the patient's clinical status, including questions as whether the patient has intrusive thoughts about harming herself or the baby. Patients who screen positive, either with a screening instrument or a few clinical questions, require a clinical interview to make the diagnosis. </p><p>We suggest that postpartum patients be screened at least once, which is consistent with the recommendation of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that clinicians screen perinatal patients at least once [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A reasonable time to screen is four to eight weeks after delivery, based upon randomized trials that found screening once at those time points was beneficial compared with usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>]. Nevertheless, the timing and frequency of screening are not established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>], and repeated screening during the first postpartum year (eg, three times) increases the number of women who screen positive for depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>]. As part of screening, patients can be counseled about their risk of developing a depressive syndrome, and taught to recognize early symptoms and seek appropriate intervention. Risk factors for postpartum depression are discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a href=\"#H88191409\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>The evidence that supports screening for postpartum depression includes a systematic review, which identified three randomized trials (total n &gt;6600 women) that compared screening four to eight weeks after delivery with usual care; the screening tool was the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and all study patients were followed for three to five months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>]. The prevalence of depression at follow-up was lower in the groups that were screened than controls, with absolute differences ranging from 5 to 9 percent. In addition, two trials (total n &gt;6000 postpartum women) each found that among women who were diagnosed with depression, <span class=\"nowrap\">improvement/remission</span> at follow-up was greater in patients who were screened than controls, by approximately 11 percent. &#160;</p><p>Some systematic reviews have found little evidence that screening for postpartum depression is beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>]; thus, a few practice guidelines do not endorse universal screening for postpartum depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>]. As an example, the Canadian Task Force on Preventative Health Care guideline recommends not routinely screening for depression in primary care settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/147,148\" class=\"abstract_t\">147,148</a>].</p><p>The benefit of screening for postpartum depression is predicated upon practice settings establishing adequate systems to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow-up. Providing these services at the same site where screening occurs may provide better results than referring patients who screen positive to a different clinic for psychiatric evaluations and treatment. In one study, patients (n &gt;1100) who screened positive for depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale &ge;13) in an obstetric setting were referred to a separate specialty perinatal psychiatric clinic; nearly 80 percent did not show up for their appointment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. &#160; </p><p>Information about screening for depression in the general adult population is discussed separately.

The diagnosis of major depression can be made with more confidence if the patient has at least three of the five mood and cognitive symptoms, especially suicidality. Focusing upon mood and cognitive symptoms is consistent with the approach taken when diagnosing major depression in the context of general medical disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis#H26342747\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Unipolar major depression'</a>.)</p><p>Postpartum unipolar depression is often not recognized by patients and clinicians because the somatic symptoms of depression overlap with some of the usual discomforts of the acute puerperium, such as fatigue, difficulty sleeping, poor appetite, and low libido [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These somatic symptoms should be evaluated in the context of normal expectations for the postpartum period. As an example, lack of energy to the point that patients cannot get out of bed for hours is abnormal and should be distinguished from the normal lack of energy that results from sleep deprivation and caring for an infant. Although postpartum insomnia is common, patients who are unable to sleep even when their babies sleep may have postpartum depression. Decreased appetite that is accompanied by the inability to enjoy the taste of food, having to force oneself to eat, and rapid weight loss probably represents a depressive syndrome. </p><p>Women are often reluctant to discuss their depressive symptoms, perhaps because of perceived social expectations that new mothers are happy, which may engender embarrassment, guilt, and stigma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/77,149\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,149</a>]. In addition, some mothers fear that their babies will be taken away by child welfare agencies. A study of patients with postpartum depression (n = 195) who were evaluated by the obstetricians found that approximately 60 percent of the patients presented with physical symptoms (eg, pain or bleeding) and did not mention their psychologic distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>].</p><p>As part of our initial evaluation for postpartum major depression, we ask patients about their attitude toward the pregnancy and infant, functioning (eg, ability to care for the infant), alcohol and drug abuse, and stressors and supports, as well as intimate partner violence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>].

For episodes of postpartum depression that present more than four weeks after delivery, no modifier is available in DSM-5. Although the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD-10) includes the diagnosis postpartum depression not otherwise specified, ICD-10 discourages use of this diagnosis and instead encourages clinicians to diagnose a depressive episode according to the same criteria that are used for nonpuerperal episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>].

However, the two disorders are distinguished in that the diagnosis of postpartum blues does not require a minimum number of symptoms. In addition, the symptoms of postpartum blues are mild and self-limited; symptoms typically develop within two to three days of delivery, peak over the next few days, and resolve within two weeks of onset. By contrast, the diagnosis of major depression requires a minimum of five symptoms that must be present for at least two weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 1</a>).

However, definitions of the puerperium range from the first 1 to 12 months following a live birth. (See <a href=\"#H5074391\" class=\"local\">'Definition of postpartum period'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of postpartum unipolar major depression in the general population of the United States and Europe is approximately 9 percent; however, the rate appears to be higher in low and middle income countries. Onset of episodes occurs before or during pregnancy in roughly 50 percent of patients. The primary risk factor is a past history of perinatal or nonperinatal depression (prepregnancy, antepartum, or postpartum). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of postpartum depression is not known. Factors that may be involved in postnatal depression include genetic susceptibility and hormonal changes, as well as psychological and social problems. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical features and symptoms of postpartum unipolar major depression appear to be comparable to the features of major depressive episodes that occur outside of the postpartum period (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 1</a>). Comorbid mental illness (eg, anxiety disorders) is common in postpartum unipolar major depression. Studies of treated and untreated patients suggest that episodes of postpartum major depression last at least one year in 30 to 50 percent of patients. Patients who recover from an episode of postpartum depression are at risk for recurrences. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postpartum depression is associated with poor nutrition and health in the offspring, and may interfere with breastfeeding, maternal-infant bonding, care of the infant and other children, and the relationship with the woman&rsquo;s partner. In addition, postnatal depression is associated with abnormal development, cognitive impairment, and psychopathology in the children. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although suicide is a leading cause of death in postnatal women, the absolute rate of suicide during the postpartum period is very low. Suicide attempts are also rare events during the puerperium. Among postnatal women, suicidal ideation occurs in approximately 3 percent. Rumination about harming the baby can occur in postpartum depression, but infanticide is a rare event that may be more likely to occur in women who are psychotic. (See <a href=\"#H5075538\" class=\"local\">'Adverse consequences'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postnatal depression may be present in women who manifest anxiety about the health of the infant, concern about their ability to care for the infant, despondency, lack of interest in the infant&rsquo;s activities, lack of response to support and reassurance, nonadherence to postnatal care, and substance use disorders. (See <a href=\"#H2479883490\" class=\"local\">'When to suspect the disorder'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consistent with guidelines from the US Preventive Services Task Force, we suggest screening all postpartum women for depression when services are in place to ensure appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We typically use the self-report Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67741%7EOBGYN%2F81407\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67741 graphicRef81407 \">figure 1A-B</a>). A reasonable alternative is to use the self-report nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 2</a>); another alternative is to ask patients about their mood and interest or pleasure in doing things, with follow-up questions for patients who are dysphoric or anhedonic. (See <a href=\"#H3686453643\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation of postpartum women with suspected depression is similar to that of non-postpartum individuals. In particular, the assessment should address suicidality, homicidality, and psychosis; identification of these symptoms should prompt a referral to a mental health specialist. Patients with severe symptoms (eg, suicidal or homicidal ideation with a specific plan and intent, or command auditory hallucinations) should be referred to an emergency department. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We suggest that the assessment focus upon the five mood and cognitive symptoms of major depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 1</a>): dysphoria, anhedonia, worthlessness or excessive guilt, impaired concentration and decision making, and suicidal ideation and behavior. The somatic symptoms of major depression &ndash; changes in sleep, energy level, and appetite &ndash; overlap with changes observed in postpartum women who are not depressed. (See <a href=\"#H5606722\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic criteria for postpartum depression are the same criteria that are used to diagnose nonpuerperal major depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H87941756\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of postpartum unipolar depression includes normal postpartum-related changes, postpartum blues, and bipolar depression, as well as other psychiatric disorders.
