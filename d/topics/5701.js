(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are, however, a variety of settings in which the SCr can increase acutely independent of the GFR, and therefore, in which there is no true change in overall kidney function. This may be due to one of three factors: decreased creatinine secretion, interference with the serum assay, or enhanced creatinine production.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DECREASED SECRETION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In normal subjects, approximately 15 percent of the urinary creatinine is derived from secretion in the proximal tubule. This value can rise to as high as 50 percent in patients with advanced kidney disease and accounts for the overestimation of the true GFR by the creatinine clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-elevate-the-serum-creatinine-concentration/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculation-of-the-creatinine-clearance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calculation of the creatinine clearance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Creatinine is an organic cation in the physiologic pH range and is secreted by the organic cation secretory pump that can be inhibited by other organic cations. Commonly used drugs that can interfere with creatinine secretion and therefore result in a self-limited and reversible rise in the SCr by as much as 0.4 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (35 to 44 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> without changing the true GFR include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The antimicrobial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a> (which is most often given in combination with sulfamethoxazole) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-elevate-the-serum-creatinine-concentration/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The antiarrhythmic drug <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronedarone</a> (which is used in some patients with atrial fibrillation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-elevate-the-serum-creatinine-concentration/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The H<sub>2</sub> blocker, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cimetidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cimetidine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-elevate-the-serum-creatinine-concentration/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ranitidine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famotidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famotidine</a>, which are other commonly used H<sub>2</sub> blockers, have a much less prominent effect on creatinine handling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-elevate-the-serum-creatinine-concentration/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].<br/><br/>The effect of cimetidine has been used clinically to improve the accuracy of the creatinine clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-elevate-the-serum-creatinine-concentration/abstract/4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7</a>]. By competitively inhibiting creatinine secretion, the creatinine clearance becomes a more accurate measure of the true glomerular filtration rate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculation-of-the-creatinine-clearance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calculation of the creatinine clearance&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cobicistat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cobicistat</a>, pharmacokinetic booster that inhibits cytochrome P-450 enzyme CYP3A4 and raises the trough concentrations of some antiviral agents used to treat HIV infection, can decrease the creatinine clearance or estimated GFR based upon serum creatinine by a mean of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> without affecting true GFR, presumably by inhibiting creatinine secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-elevate-the-serum-creatinine-concentration/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERFERENCE WITH THE SERUM ASSAY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum creatinine is most often measured by the alkaline picrate method. This colorimetric assay can recognize other compounds as creatinine chromogens, particularly acetoacetate in diabetic ketoacidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-elevate-the-serum-creatinine-concentration/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In this setting, the SCr can rise by 0.5 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or more (44 to 176 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> a change that is rapidly reversed with insulin therapy. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefoxitin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cefoxitin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flucytosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flucytosine</a> are other drugs that can produce a similar effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-elevate-the-serum-creatinine-concentration/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p>The Ektachem (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, New York) method, using the enzyme creatinine iminohydrolase, and the creatinine PAP method (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany), using the enzymes creatininase, creatinase, and sarcosine oxidase, yield creatinine values comparable to those obtained using the kinetic alkaline picrate method. In general, these methods appear to have less interferences than the alkaline picrate methods, but there are reports of interfering substances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-elevate-the-serum-creatinine-concentration/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. As an example, the antifungal agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flucytosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flucytosine</a> interferes with the Ektachem measurement; it may increase the value by as much as 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-elevate-the-serum-creatinine-concentration/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p>It seems likely in the future that more specific assays for creatinine will eliminate the problem of drug interference. One possible method is the use of an artificial receptor that is specific for creatinine and that undergoes a color change when creatinine is bound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-elevate-the-serum-creatinine-concentration/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ENHANCED CREATININE PRODUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The SCr varies during the day, rising by as much as 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (44 to 88 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> after a large cooked meat meal (since muscle contains creatine, which is converted to creatinine by the heat from cooking) and then returning slowly to the baseline level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-elevate-the-serum-creatinine-concentration/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>It has also been suggested that the serum creatinine concentration rises more rapidly with rhabdomyolysis (up to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 220 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> per day) than with other causes of acute renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-elevate-the-serum-creatinine-concentration/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Release of preformed creatinine from injured muscle <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> release of creatine that is then converted into creatinine in the extracellular fluid have been proposed to explain this finding. However, neither of these mechanisms appears to account for the increase in the serum creatinine concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-elevate-the-serum-creatinine-concentration/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. An alternative explanation is that rhabdomyolysis often affects men with a high muscle mass and a higher rate of creatinine production than seen in frequently ill patients with other forms of acute renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-elevate-the-serum-creatinine-concentration/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Creatine supplements are increasingly used in health and disease. For most people, this will not lead to increases in serum creatinine levels (or declines in estimated GFR). One randomized control trial of patients with diabetes showed no effect on GFR measured using (51)Cr-EDTA clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-elevate-the-serum-creatinine-concentration/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], despite higher muscle phosphoryl creatine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22322751\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small number of drugs affect the serum creatinine level. There are two primary mechanisms for this. The drug may compete with the secretion of creatinine at the level of the kidney tubule or may interfere with the assay.
