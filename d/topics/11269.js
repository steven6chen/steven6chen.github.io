(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-myeloproliferative-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the myeloproliferative neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This group of diseases shares several distinct features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are clonal disorders of hematopoiesis that arise in a hematopoietic stem or early progenitor cell.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are characterized by the dysregulated production of a particular lineage of mature myeloid cells with fairly normal differentiation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They exhibit a variable tendency to progress to acute leukemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They share abnormalities of hemostasis and thrombosis.</p><p/><p>The individual myeloproliferative neoplasms predominantly affect a single myeloid cell type, resulting in an excess of neutrophils in CML, erythrocytes in PV, and platelets in ET. However, there is considerable overlap between the clinical features as patients with CML, for example, often have thrombocytosis. </p><p>CML is almost invariably associated with an abnormal chromosome 22 known as the Philadelphia chromosome, often abbreviated as Ph, Ph(1), or Ph<sup>1</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22)(q34;q11) results in the formation of a unique gene product (BCR-ABL1), which is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. This deregulated tyrosine kinase is implicated in the development of CML and has become a primary target for the treatment of this disorder. </p><p>The molecular genetics of the Philadelphia chromosome will be reviewed here. How the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein product of the Philadelphia chromosome promotes leukemogenesis is discussed separately.

Subsequently, advances in chromosome banding techniques demonstrated that the Ph chromosome was the result of a balanced translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, denoted t(9;22) (q34.1;q11.21), where the derivative chromosome 22 is significantly smaller (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62227\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62227 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The Ph chromosome is present in hematopoietic cells from patients with CML but not in nonhematopoietic tissues, including bone marrow fibroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]; thus, the Ph chromosome is acquired and not inherited through the germline.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Nomenclature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A generally accepted nomenclature is used to distinguish translocated genes and the gene products. Human genes are designated by capitalized italics (as in BCR-ABL1 gene with BCR-ABL in italics), while human proteins are designated by having the letters capitalized, without the use of italics (as in BCR-ABL1 protein without italics). Proteins may also be designated by the prefix &quot;p&quot; followed by the molecular weight in kilodaltons followed by the gene name added as a superscript (as in p210 <sup>BCR-ABL</sup> protein). Due to technical constraints, italics will not be used in this review.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Structure of the Philadelphia chromosome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The structure of the Ph chromosome was established by initial studies demonstrating translocation of the ABL1 gene (also known as c-ABL) on chromosome 9q34 to the Ph chromosome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and the subsequent discovery of breakpoints near the 5' end of the ABL1 gene in leukemic cells from patients with CML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The ABL1 gene had been previously identified as the cellular homologue of the transforming gene of Abelson murine leukemia virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], an acutely transforming retrovirus that induces B-lymphoid leukemia in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The ABL1 gene on chromosome 9 has 11 exons with 2 alternative 5' first exons, and a very large first intron of over 250 kilobases (kb). The ABL1 gene encodes a non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase, c-ABL (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66610\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66610 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellular and molecular biology of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'c-ABL1'</a>.)</p><p>DNA sequences immediately 5' to the ABL1 gene on the Ph chromosome were derived from chromosome 22 sequences, and DNA probes from a small region on chromosome 22 detected genomic rearrangements by Southern analysis of genomic DNA in virtually all CML samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This locus on chromosome 22 was named the <strong>b</strong>reakpoint <strong>c</strong>luster <strong>r</strong>egion, or bcr. Subsequent characterization of this locus demonstrated that the bcr region was in the middle of a large protein-coding gene of 25 exons now called the BCR gene (also called PHL in some early reports). Five small exons were initially identified in the bcr region and denoted exons b1 through b5; they are now known to be exons 12 through 16 of the major breakpoint cluster region (M-BCR). The BCR gene product is a 160 kilodalton cytoplasmic phosphoprotein denoted BCR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellular and molecular biology of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'BCR'</a>.)</p><p>Depending upon the location of the breakpoint within the major BCR region, the consequence of the t(9;22) translocation in CML is to fuse the first 13 or 14 exons of the BCR gene upstream of the second exon of the ABL1 gene, with the breakpoint on chromosome 9 falling in the large first intron region. The two alternative fusion genes are traditionally described according to the original bcr exon nomenclature as b2a2 and b3a2 fusions or by the subsequent nomenclature as e13a2 or e14a2, respectively. Transcription of the fusion gene followed by RNA splicing leads to the generation of a novel 8.5 kb fusion BCR-ABL1 mRNA that encodes a fusion protein of 210 kilodaltons designated p210 BCR-ABL1 or p210 <sup>BCR-ABL1</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The protein product of the b3a2 fusion is 25 amino acids longer than the b2a2 product due to the inclusion of the b3 exon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellular and molecular biology of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'BCR-ABL1'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4596194\"><span class=\"h3\">Distinct forms of BCR-ABL1 from alternative chromosome 22 breakpoints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several years after the description of BCR-ABL1 in patients with CML, it was discovered that the majority of pediatric and adult patients with Ph-positive B-ALL had chromosome 22 breakpoints within the large first intron of the BCR gene rather than the classic bcr region, leading to formation of a smaller BCR-ABL1 fusion gene consisting of the first exon of BCR fused upstream of ABL1 exon 2 (e1a2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The bcr region in CML was renamed the major or M-bcr, while the first intron breakpoints were designated the minor or m-bcr. This fusion generates a protein of 190 kD in size, p190 <sup>BCR-ABL1</sup> (also referred to as p185 in some references) that contains BCR first exon-encoded sequence fused to the same amount of ABL1 found in p210 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A third minor BCR region (mu-BCR) on chromosome 22 resulting in fusion of BCR exon 19 to ABL1 exon 2 (e19a2) has been described in several patients, leading to generation of a p230 form of BCR-ABL1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66610\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66610 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>As such, there are three common variants of BCR-ABL1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66610\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66610 \">figure 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>p210 <sup>BCR-ABL1</sup> &mdash; Created by the fusion of the ABL1 gene at a2 with a breakpoint in the major BCR region at either e13 or e14 to produce an e13a2 or e14a2 transcript which is translated into a 210 kilodalton protein.

(See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'p190 and p230 fusion proteins'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>In addition to these more common variant forms, rare patients with fusion of BCR exon 1 or exon b2 to ABL exon 3 (e1a3 and b2a3) and BCR exon 6 to ABL1 exon 2 (e6a2) have been described, where both fusion mRNAs are predicted to have an intact translational reading frame [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Reciprocal translocation product</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reciprocal translocation product on the derivative chromosome 9, notated as der(9), is an ABL1-BCR fusion gene that could generate an ABL1-BCR fusion protein. However, the inconsistent expression of the ABL1-BCR gene in patients with CML, along with survival data in ABL1-BCR negative patients, suggest that this product does not play a major role in the pathogenesis of this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Some studies have suggested that der(9) deletions may confer a worse prognosis in patients with CML marked by lower response rates and a shorter progression-free survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. However, deletion of der(9) may no longer be a marker of poor prognosis among patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. As an example, combined data from 521 patients enrolled in three prospective with a median follow-up of 42 months demonstrated that der(9) deletions detected by FISH did not confer a worse prognosis for patients with early chronic phase CML treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4596364\"><span class=\"h2\">Leukemogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of chronic phase CML appears to be a direct result of BCR-ABL1 activity, which promotes its development by allowing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uncontrolled proliferation of transformed cells </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discordant maturation </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Escape from apoptosis </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Altered interaction with the cellular matrix </p><p/><p>The progression of CML from chronic phase to accelerated phase or blast crisis is a complex, multistep process, but also appears to involve the constitutive expression of the BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase.

This can be accomplished through conventional cytogenetic analysis (karyotyping), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, or by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Southern blot techniques to identify BCR-ABL1 gene rearrangements were used in the past, but are time consuming and no longer employed as a routine diagnostic test. Evaluating for BCR-ABL1 protein by Western blot analysis is also not commonly used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4596973\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytogenetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Ph chromosome was initially discovered by cytogenetic analysis using May-Gr&uuml;nwald-Giemsa (MGG) banded metaphase chromosomes from marrow or peripheral blood. However, this technique requires in vitro culture, is time- and labor-intensive, has a sensitivity limit of detection of about 5 percent Ph positive cells in a population of normal cells, and can give false negative results in cells with complex chromosomal rearrangements. For these reasons, traditional cytogenetic analysis is being supplanted by newer methods. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">FISH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) employs large DNA probes linked to fluorophores; it permits direct detection of the chromosomal position of the BCR and ABL1 genes when employed with metaphase chromosome preparations. It can also be utilized on interphase cells from bone marrow or peripheral blood, in which physical colocalization of BCR and ABL probes is indicative of the presence of the BCR-ABL fusion gene (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73543\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73543 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The specificity of metaphase FISH is somewhat higher than MGG banding for detection of the Ph chromosome, and allows easy identification of complex chromosomal rearrangements that mask the t(9;22) translocation. The specificity of interphase FISH is lower, by approximately 10 percent, due to false positive results from coincidental colocalization of non-fused BCR and ABL1 genes in interphase nuclei [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The use of double-color, dual-fusion probes for interphase FISH may improve the specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Although most FISH techniques cannot distinguish among different chromosome 22 breakpoints, some commercially available probes allow detection of a range of chromosome 9 breakpoints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Preliminary results using these additional FISH probes suggest that the presence of 5'-ABL1 deletions on the derivative chromosome 9 in 10 to 15 percent of patients with CML may indicate a subset having a worse prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], independent of the Sokal and <span class=\"nowrap\">Hasford/Euro</span> prognostic scoring systems. However, this must be confirmed in a prospective study. The poor outcome of these patients cannot be attributed to the loss of reciprocal ABL1-BCR expression and is not fully reversed by therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4597093\"><span class=\"h3\">RT-PCR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a highly sensitive technique that employs specific primers to amplify a DNA fragment from BCR-ABL1 mRNA transcripts. Depending upon the combination of primers used, the method can detect the e1a2, e13a2 (b2a2), e14a2 (b3a2) and e19a2 fusion genes. The use of nested primers and sequential PCR reactions makes the technique extremely sensitive, capable of routine detection of one Ph positive cell in 10(5) to 10(6) normal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4596194\" class=\"local\">'Distinct forms of BCR-ABL1 from alternative chromosome 22 breakpoints'</a> above.)</p><p>Because RT-PCR is low-cost, sensitive, rapid, and not labor intensive, it is becoming the diagnostic test of choice for Ph-positive leukemia. The data can be quantitated by including a competitive standard RNA in the reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] or by monitoring the accumulation of product in real time using fluorescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This technique can be used to monitor response to treatment as well as to detect minimal residual disease following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/29,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,32,33</a>].

Several different internal reference standards are employed worldwide. The published definitions of molecular responses use ABL1 as the reference gene, as this is employed by the majority of laboratories, including most in the United States. GUSB is used in some European laboratories, while BCR is used in Australia and Asia. Many clinical laboratories now use an international reference standard to report RT-PCR results on the International Scale (IS), which allows direct comparison of patient results between laboratories and to data from clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It is preferable to obtain serial samples from individual patients at the same laboratory, if possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Although several studies have shown reasonable concordance and correlation (r = 0.85 to 9.0) between quantitative RT-PCR results obtained from bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood, the majority of molecular response data from clinical trials are based on analysis of peripheral blood samples, so only blood should be used for serial monitoring. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whereas quantitative BCR-ABL1 transcript levels on the IS vary widely at diagnosis, two studies document that the velocity of decline in transcripts or the &quot;halving time&quot; is a better measure of favorable early molecular response than an arbitrary value such as 10 percent at three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

When compared with other patients with CML, patients with the p190 fusion protein may have an inferior outcome when treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. A retrospective analysis of 14 patients with p190 reported a low response rate to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> therapy with frequent evolution into accelerated or blast phase disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Several patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">e19/a2</span> BCR-ABL1 fusions and p230 <sup>BCR-ABL1</sup> have been described with a disorder similar to classic CML but with mild clinical symptoms. These include lower peripheral blood leukocyte counts consisting principally of neutrophils, thrombocytosis, less severe splenomegaly, and delayed or absent transformation to blast crisis. It was proposed that patients with the <span class=\"nowrap\">e19/a2</span> fusion comprise a distinct clinical entity called neutrophilic CML or chronic neutrophilic leukemia, with a much more benign clinical course than that associated with traditional p210 <sup>BCR-ABL1</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Patients with 3' M-bcr breakpoints <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> e14a2 (b3a2) BCR-ABL1 transcripts may exhibit higher platelet counts, although this is also controversial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute lymphoblastic leukemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ph chromosome positive B-ALL is heterogeneous at the molecular genetic level. While the majority of such patients exhibit m-bcr breakpoints and p190 <sup>BCR-ABL1</sup>, about one-half of adults and 10 percent of children have M-bcr breakpoints and the p210 <sup>BCR-ABL1</sup>. Many of the latter patients have persistence of the Ph chromosome after chemotherapy-induced hematologic remissions and have the Ph chromosome in myeloid cells and in myeloid colonies grown in vitro, suggesting that they represent cases of CML presenting in blast crisis after an unrecognized chronic phase. </p><p>In contrast, most ALL patients expressing p190 <sup>BCR-ABL1</sup> do not exhibit the additional cytogenetic abnormalities typical of CML blast crisis, lack the Ph chromosome in myeloid cells and colonies, and become Ph-negative in hematologic remission. These observations suggest that the Ph translocation occurred in a cell that is more restricted in its differentiation potential than a pluripotent stem cell, perhaps a committed B-lymphoid progenitor. This hypothesis is supported by studies of xenotransplantation of Ph-positive ALL cells into NOD-SCID mice, in which leukemia-initiating cells from patients with p190 positive ALL had a committed B-lymphoid progenitor phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

This is supported by a report of five patients with p190 positive ALL in whom the Ph chromosome was detected by interphase FISH analysis in granulocytes in all of the patients, suggesting multilineage involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. It is possible that some or most p190 positive CML patients have rapid transition to lymphoid blast crisis and nearly always present as ALL. In a second study, xenotransplantation of Ph-positive ALL cells into <span class=\"nowrap\">NOD/SCID</span> mice suggested that the leukemia-initiating cell has a primitive (CD34+CD38-) phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

In about half of such patients, a &ldquo;variant translocation&rdquo; is seen in which one or more chromosomes in addition to 9 and 22 are involved in the BCR-ABL1 translocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Another subset of patients may be Ph-negative by karyotype but have evidence of BCR-ABL1 gene fusion by metaphase or interphase FISH analysis or RT-PCR. Initial studies suggested that patients with these variant translocations may have a worse outcome with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> therapy than those with classic translocations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. However, subsequent analysis of 559 patients enrolled on prospective studies of imatinib reported that the 30 patients with variant translocations had similar response rates to those seen in patients with the classic Ph translocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In addition, the deletion of the derivative chromosome 9 did not appear to affect patient outcome.</p><p>However, about one-third of the group lacked molecular evidence of BCR-ABL1 fusion. In general, these patients have distinct clinical features, including short survival, poor response to therapy, absence of basophilia, frequent thrombocytopenia, and may progress to increasing leukocytosis, organomegaly, extramedullary infiltrates, and marrow failure without a terminal phase of AML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. It is likely that most of these patients have a disease that is distinct from CML, most likely one of the myelodysplastic or <span class=\"nowrap\">MDS/MPN</span> overlap syndromes. It is important to pursue a molecular diagnosis in such cases, as some of these patients have leukemias associated with other dysregulated tyrosine kinases, such as PDGFRB, while many cases of chronic neutrophilic leukemia and atypical CML are associated with activating mutations in the receptor for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF3R) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

This fusion gene is the product of a balanced translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, denoted t(9;22) (q34.1;q11.21), which juxtaposes a 5&rsquo; segment of a breakpoint cluster region (BCR) at 22q11 and the 3&rsquo; segment of the ABL oncogene (ABL1) at 9q34, resulting in an abnormally small chromosome known as the Philadelphia chromosome. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'The Philadelphia chromosome'</a> above.)</p><p>Chromosome 22 is broken at one of four exons (e1, e13, e14, or e19) and this exon is joined with the ABL1 oncogene exon a2 to produce one of four possible transcript products: e1a2, e13a2, e14a2, or e19a2, corresponding to the three common variants of BCR-ABL1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66610\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66610 \">figure 2</a>) (See <a href=\"#H4596194\" class=\"local\">'Distinct forms of BCR-ABL1 from alternative chromosome 22 breakpoints'</a> above.):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>p210 <sup>BCR-ABL1</sup> &mdash; Created by the fusion of the ABL1 gene at a2 with a breakpoint in the major BCR region at either e13 or e14 to produce an e13a2 or e14a2 transcript which is translated into a 210 kilodalton protein.

This variant is seen in some patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia. </p><p/><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria for CML require the detection of the Ph chromosome or its products, the BCR-ABL1 fusion mRNA and the BCR-ABL1 protein. This can be accomplished through conventional cytogenetic analysis (karyotyping), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, or by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
