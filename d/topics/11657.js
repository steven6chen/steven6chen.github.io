The name is derived from the Greek word (acantha) for thorn. It should be differentiated from the echinocyte, which has more numerous, uniform, and finer spiny projections and is associated with severe renal and liver disease. </p><p>Acanthocytes may be seen in a variety of diseases, including severe liver disease. In neuroacanthocytosis, the degree of neurologic impairment does not correlate with the degree of acanthocytosis on the smear. &#160;</p><p>The general category of neuroacanthocytosis includes abetalipoproteinemia, chorea-acanthocytosis, and McLeod syndrome. Acanthocytes appear more variably in pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration and in Huntington disease-like 2. These disorders are discussed here. Acanthocytosis in liver and other systemic disease is discussed separately.

This protein is essential for the formation and eventual secretion of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, both from the intestine (chylomicrons) and liver (LDL and VLDL). Chylomicron formation is necessary for absorption and initial transport of the fat-soluble vitamins.</p><p>The neurologic manifestations of abetalipoproteinemia result from the inability to absorb and transport <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroacanthocytosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vitamin A</a> deficiency may also contribute to the retinal degeneration.

During childhood or adolescence, progressive ataxia, neuropathy, and vision impairment develop. Impaired visual acuity and visual field defects are common. Funduscopic examination reveals pigmentary degeneration of the retina (retinitis pigmentosa). Dysarthria is common. The sensory motor neuropathy manifests with weakness and distal muscle atrophy. Reflexes are diminished or absent, although extensor plantar responses may be present. There is truncal and limb ataxia.

The autosomal recessive inheritance, presence of acanthocytes, and abnormal lipid studies of abetalipoproteinemia are important distinguishing features. </p><p>Abetalipoproteinemia is distinguished from severe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a> deficiency by the absence of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. The lipid profile also helps distinguish it from a rare autosomal recessive ataxia (ataxia with vitamin E deficiency, AVED) associated with low or absent vitamin E levels and normal lipids; this entity is associated with mutations of the alpha-tocopherol transfer protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroacanthocytosis/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Vitamin E supplementation slows progression and may improve ataxia in these conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-e#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin E&quot;, section on 'Deficiency'</a>.) </p><p>Mutations in the apolipoprotein B gene cause hypobetalipoproteinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroacanthocytosis/abstract/4,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15-18</a>]. Individuals homozygous for these mutations may present with clinical findings indistinguishable from abetalipoproteinemia. Heterozygotes typically have milder phenotypes and low but detectable VLDL and LDL levels. As in abetalipoproteinemia, triglyceride and cholesterol levels are very low. Diagnosis is based on the autosomal codominant pattern of inheritance, clinical features, and <span class=\"nowrap\">lipid/lipoprotein</span> analysis. Commercial molecular genetic testing for mutations in the apolipoprotein B gene is not currently available. Patients are treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a> supplementation.</p><p>A similar disorder characterized by hypoprebetalipoproteinemia, acanthocytosis, retinitis pigmentosa, and pallidal degeneration (called the HARP syndrome) is caused by mutations of the PANK2 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroacanthocytosis/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].

Motor nerve conduction studies may be entirely normal. Electromyography reveals evidence of chronic denervation with reinnervation.</p><p/><p>The muscle biopsy shows predominantly neurogenic features including small angulated fibers and grouped atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroacanthocytosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. An increase of central nuclei and split fibers have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroacanthocytosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Peripheral nerve biopsies have shown a loss of predominantly large diameter fibers with features of nerve regeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroacanthocytosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1983242\" class=\"local\">'Mcleod syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p>Huntington disease and Huntington disease-like 2 can also present with chorea or parkinsonism, along with cognitive and behavioral changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroacanthocytosis/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. Atrophy of the caudate nucleus is shared by these entities. Prominent orofacial dyskinesias causing dysarthria and dysphagia suggest chorea-acanthocytosis. The autosomal pattern of inheritance, the phenomenon of anticipation (earlier disease onset in successive generations), lack of serum CK enzyme elevations and distal muscle wasting, and significant cortical atrophy help distinguish Huntington disease and Huntington disease-like 2 from chorea-acanthocytosis. Finally, these two disorders may be diagnosed by molecular genetic analysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H4519438\" class=\"local\">'Huntington Disease-Like 2'</a> below.)</p><p>Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disease that may present with hepatic, neurologic, or psychiatric symptoms almost always before age 50 years. Patients with Wilson disease may present with a variety of abnormal movements, including tremors, chorea, choreoathetosis, or parkinsonian features. An important feature that distinguishes chorea-acanthocytosis from Wilson's disease is the absence of liver disease. Low serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels along with increased urinary copper excretion are specific to Wilson disease. Testing for mutations in the gene responsible for Wilson disease (ATP7B) is commercially available.
