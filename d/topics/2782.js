Although neuropathic pain may be more difficult to treat, a favorable response to opioid-based analgesia is often possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-cancer-pain#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of cancer pain&quot;, section on 'Inferred pathophysiology (types of cancer pain)'</a>.)</p><p>Opioids are also potentially abusable drugs. The public health consequences of opioid abuse drive the imperative that all physicians assume responsibility for risk management when these drugs are prescribed for legitimate medical purposes. These issues are discussed elsewhere.

These receptors are present in tissues throughout the body, including both the peripheral and central nervous systems.</p><p>Based upon their effects on the mu receptor, opioids are conventionally divided into pure agonists, agonist-antagonists (of which there are two subtypes: partial agonists and mixed agonist-antagonists), and pure antagonists (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69457\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69457 \">table 1</a>). Mu receptor antagonists have no intrinsic analgesic properties; they are used to prevent or reverse opioid effects (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-side-effects-in-patients-receiving-opioids-for-chronic-pain#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of side effects in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain&quot;, section on 'Opioid bowel dysfunction'</a>).</p><p>With few exceptions, the management of chronic cancer pain usually involves the long-term administration of pure mu receptor agonists (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F111207\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111207 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F111206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111206 \">table 3</a>). However, several of the agonist-antagonist drugs are commercially available in the United States and other countries, and at least one, the partial agonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a>, is used for treatment of cancer-related pain in some settings. Several other centrally-acting analgesics, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tapentadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tapentadol</a>, have some mu agonist effects mixed with other prominent mechanisms and also are used for cancer pain in some circumstances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Partial agonists: Buprenorphine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The partial agonist drug <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> is available as a treatment for opioid addiction and as a treatment for pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-opioid-use-disorder#H19508682\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder&quot;, section on 'Buprenorphine'</a>.)</p><p>As a partial agonist, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> has the ability to induce withdrawal if it is administered to patients who are already physically dependent on a pure mu agonist drug. It also has a ceiling effect for analgesia.</p><p>Transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> has been licensed in Europe and is commonly prescribed for chronic pain. There is less experience with transdermal buprenorphine in the United States, where a patch formulation is available (Butrans 5, 10, or 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/hour,</span> all intended for seven-day use) for treatment of chronic pain. The transdermal patch carries a warning against exceeding 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/hour</span> due to the risk of QT prolongation.</p><p>Experience with this drug in the management of cancer pain is limited; however, anecdotal reports, a few small prospective uncontrolled studies, and at least two placebo-controlled randomized trials (conducted over a period of approximately two weeks) support at least short-term effectiveness and safety in patients with severe cancer-related pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Few comparative studies have been performed against other long-acting opioids, and the quality of the evidence from two such trials is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Nonetheless, a 2009 consensus statement from an international panel with expertise in palliative care and pain treatment endorsed the use of transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> where available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Given the limited evidence, the doses available in the United States, and the need to consider buprenorphine only in those who are relatively opioid na&iuml;ve, this drug is used uncommonly and should be considered primarily for those with new-onset, relatively moderate cancer pain. In support of this, a 2016 abridged Cochrane review concluded, given the limited quality of the evidence for patients with cancer pain, that buprenorphine should not be considered a first-line option for opioid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>A long-acting (daily or twice daily administration) <a href=\"https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=69df676c-0357-4e67-a92d-f6b337b34a2f&amp;token=VfQ7Y9OrMNcY/gioSKy5pLIRjMA6d+QXD01ymQNG/YThX70mS1+OPaJ+5uZ64tcj8f4Yk7RKogzFnmCLBjruvDSPDwYQmA+9/gRllQ+bb222ZuMtToHuBidmbkj4hvSj&amp;TOPIC_ID=2814\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">buprenorphine buccal film</a> is also available in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Pure mu agonists commonly used for cancer pain</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Morphine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Morphine</a> is the prototype opioid drug for moderate to severe cancer pain on the third step of the WHO analgesic ladder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63298\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63298 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It is usually considered to be a standard for comparison. In the original WHO guidelines, this preference for morphine was not based upon any existing comparative data. Since then, randomized trials and systematic reviews have failed to demonstrate the superiority of morphine over any other mu agonist (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxymorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxymorphone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>) in terms of efficacy or tolerability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/11-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-18</a>]. Furthermore, there is very large intraindividual variation in the response to the different mu agonist drugs and no way to predict whether a patient will have a more favorable balance between analgesia and side effects when given morphine or one of the other drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Accordingly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> should not be considered the &ldquo;drug of choice,&rdquo; but rather, just one of many drugs that could be selected for chronic cancer pain. The decision to select one or another is often based upon the experience of the clinician, prior experience of the patient, cost, dosing implications of the formulation, and other factors.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Morphine</a> has a short half-life, but it is available in multiple formulations, including immediate-release tablets, oral liquid, suppository, solution for intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) use (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F111206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111206 \">table 3</a>), and modified-release drugs that provide continuous analgesia with once or twice daily dosing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F111207\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111207 \">table 2</a>). The short half-life formulations are preferred by some patients and also may be useful for breakthrough pain when coadministered with a long-acting formulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-cancer-pain#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of cancer pain&quot;, section on 'Temporal assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Regardless of the formulation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> is primarily metabolized in the liver and its metabolites are renally excreted. Two active metabolites have been extensively studied, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-gluconoride (M6G) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Preclinical data and limited human studies suggest that M6G contributes to analgesic activity and M3G may be the cause of some of the side effects that occur during morphine therapy, although this is not yet proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>].</p><p>Metabolite concentration may be idiosyncratically high as a result of unknown but presumed genetic factors, or more commonly, metabolite concentration may increase relative to the parent compound (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>) as a result of renal disease that reduces excretion of both glucuronides. If this occurs, use of the drug may be associated with unanticipated potency or side effects. Clinically, this means that morphine should be administered cautiously in the setting of renal insufficiency, and if fluctuation in kidney function can be anticipated, morphine may not be the preferred opioid given the risk of changes in effects and side effects as metabolite accumulation occurs.

The extended release form of hydromorphone (Exalgo) is available in 8, 12, and 16 mg strengths, and is dosed once daily. Caution must be used to avoid medication errors when prescribing this product, as 8 mg tablets are also available as immediate-release hydromorphone tablets.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hydromorphone</a> is highly soluble in water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] and a commercially available concentrated solution (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> facilitates SC or IV administration of relatively high doses. Some clinicians prefer to use hydromorphone in patients with renal insufficiency because its active, renally-cleared metabolites appear in relatively low concentration (compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>) and may be unlikely to cause unanticipated effects. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Use in renal failure'</a> below.)</p><p>The analgesic efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxymorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxymorphone</a> is comparable to other opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. It has a relatively low propensity to release histamine, a characteristic also shared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>. At least in theory, this may reduce the risk of pruritus or urticaria, although there is no evidence that this difference is clinically relevant. </p><p>A long-acting formulation of the drug, Opana ER, was voluntarily withdrawn from the United States market in July 2017 at the request of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) because of concerns that the benefits of the drug were outweighed by the risks related to continued injection abuse of the drug, despite a reformulation in 2012 intended to make the drug resistant to physical and chemical manipulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. There are generic extended-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxymorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxymorphone</a> products that remain on the market at present. </p><p>Short-acting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocodone</a> is only available in the United States in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>. The amount of the nonopioid constituent limits use of these short-acting combinations to relatively opioid-naive patients with moderate pain.</p><p>A long-acting formulation of single entity <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocodone</a> (Zohydro ER) was approved in the United States in October 2013 for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. It is classified as a Schedule II controlled substance, requiring a written prescription, and cannot be refilled. Although analgesic efficacy has been shown in a placebo-controlled trial conducted in patients with chronic low back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], the only data addressing efficacy in cancer populations are from observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. While the drug was initially approved without abuse-deterrent properties, it now incorporates excipients that form a viscous gel when the capsules are crushed or dissolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

The transdermal formulation is used for chronic pain. Both the non-oral route and the relatively infrequent dosing (every two to three days for transdermal fentanyl) are considered advantages by some patients. Although data from clinical trials about the potential for a relatively reduced risk of constipation from transdermal fentanyl are conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>], three meta-analyses have found a significant advantage for transdermal fentanyl over sustained release oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> in terms of this side effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. Fentanyl may be preferred over morphine in patients with renal insufficiency due to lack of active metabolites.</p><p>Exposing the patch to heat (eg, an increase in body temperature, use of a heating pad or warming blanket during surgery) may cause an unintentional increase in systemic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> absorption, which may increase the risk of respiratory depression.

At least one controlled trial has shown that methadone is equally effective to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> for cancer pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Among the potential benefits of methadone use are its low cost and long duration of action; it is the only long acting opioid available in a liquid formulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Because only approximately 20 percent of a dose is eliminated unchanged by the kidneys and there are no active metabolites, methadone, when dosed appropriately (see below), also may be a useful drug in patients with kidney disease (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Use in renal failure'</a> below). </p><p>The fact that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> is effective in treating the opioid craving that occurs in those with opioid addiction has been used as a rationale for the use of this drug in those patients who develop aberrant drug-related behavior when given another mu agonist for cancer pain and for those who are a high risk of these behaviors before starting therapy.</p><p>These potential benefits of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> do not alter the recommendation that the drug should be prescribed only by those who are familiar with its pharmacology and can employ safe prescribing practices. Guidelines for safe administration must be followed to reduce the risk of unintentional overdose. Clinicians who have questions about these guidelines or who lack experience may wish to seek assistance from a consultant before prescribing this drug. The pertinent issues are summarized as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methadone</a> has a variable half-life, which averages approximately 24 hours but ranges from 12 hours to almost one week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Since five to six half-lives are required before steady state plasma concentrations are approached, the time required before a methadone regimen can be considered stable varies from several days to several weeks. During the period when plasma levels are rising toward steady state levels, the patient must be considered at risk for unintentional overdose from accumulation in plasma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Due to highly variable and prolonged terminal half-life, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> has the highest risk of among opioids of accumulation and overdosage during initial titration to effect, and during dose adjustment in chronic use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perhaps more challenging, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> is marketed in most of the world as a racemate containing a 1:1 mixture of the d- and the l-isomer. The d-isomer is a relatively potent N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) inhibitor and not an opioid. NMDA antagonism is associated with nonopioid analgesia and with reversal of opioid tolerance. These effects may explain the observation that methadone can be far more potent than would be expected from the equianalgesic dose table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F111206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111206 \">table 3</a>), particularly when administered to patients with substantial prior opioid exposure. Concern about this unexpected potency must be addressed by selecting a cautious initial dose when switching from another drug to methadone (see below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methadone</a> can prolong the QTc interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>], a phenomenon that predisposes to a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia, torsades du pointe. Although the clinical importance of this effect continues to be controversial, it is prudent to check an ECG prior to therapy in most patients. The drug should be used very cautiously in those with a QTc interval &gt;450 milliseconds (ms; by considering interventions that may treat any potentially reversible causes of QTc prolongation, such as hypokalemia) and generally should not be used if the QTc interval exceeds 500 ms. A repeat ECG is prudent in all patients, particularly if the total daily dose reaches 100 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], and repeated monitoring is essential in those patients predisposed to QTc prolongation (eg, those taking other drugs with this effect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 4</a>) and those with existing significant heart disease).

On the other hand, patients undergoing concomitant therapy with a CYP3A4 or 2B6 inducer may experience decreased methadone levels and reduced efficacy or withdrawal. A table listing several known inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76992 \">table 5</a>).

The World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder for treatment of cancer pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63298\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63298 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], first published in the 1980s, referred to this drug as the prototype &ldquo;weak&rdquo; or &ldquo;mild&rdquo; opioid, but now this designation is understood to be pharmacologically inappropriate. Although it is intended to treat mild to moderate pain in the patient with limited to no opioid exposure, there is very limited evidence of a positive therapeutic index in cancer pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], and any pure mu agonist can be used for this purpose if the dose is selected appropriately. This approach is endorsed in guidelines for cancer pain management from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and other organizations, including the European Association for Palliative Care; it effectively eliminates the second &ldquo;rung&rdquo; of the analgesic ladder approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63298\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63298 \">figure 1</a>) and reflects attempts to update the original WHO guideline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. One study found that low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> (up to 30 mg daily) reduces pain significantly as compared with codeine (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a>) with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> in patients with moderate cancer pain, with similar tolerability and an earlier effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Codeine</a> is also available in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>. However, the maximal daily dose of acetaminophen (current recommendations put this figure at 3.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day,</span> lower in those without known liver disease or risk factors for liver disease) effectively limits the amount of codeine that can be administered with this combination product.

The analgesic efficacy of codeine requires conversion to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> via the CYP2D6 isoenzyme of the P450 hepatic enzyme system. CYP2D6 is highly polymorphic, with over 90 known allelic variants.</p><p>Five to 10 percent of patients inherit a slow metabolizer phenotype, and they derive only limited or no therapeutic benefit from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a> because it will not be converted to its active moiety. Conversely, patients who are ultra-rapid metabolizers based on CYP2D6 genotype may have higher than expected <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> levels (an initial &ldquo;overdose&rdquo;), with more side effects and a shorter than expected duration of pain control.

Six formulations are now available in the United States: an oral transmucosal fentanyl lozenge (Actiq), an immediate-release transmucosal tablet formulation (Abstral), an effervescent fentanyl buccal tablet (Fentora), a nasal spray (Lazanda), and a sublingual spray (Subsys) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F111217\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111217 \">table 9</a>).

Comparative effectiveness against one of the typical short-acting oral formulations has been determined for the nasal and oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> formulations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/73,75,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,75,79</a>], and the more rapid onset of effect appears to be highly favorable, at least for some patients. Sublingual fentanyl may also be preferred by patients over subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>] Few studies have directly compared transmucosal formulations with one another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>Due to cost and limited experience, the transmucosal drugs are generally considered only after a patient has demonstrated a poor response to an oral rescue dose. Patients with very rapid onset pain might also be considered for an early trial. Given the lack of comparative data, there are no recommendations about which of the many formulations might be preferable.</p><p>Regardless of the formulation selected and in contrast to the oral rescue medications, the recommended starting dose of transmucosal immediate-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> is the lowest or next-to-lowest available dose. This recommendation is made because controlled trials have not confirmed that a dose proportionate to the baseline dose is needed to observe effects. Dose titration usually is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Selecting the route of administration</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The oral route is usually preferred for chronic treatment of cancer pain because of convenience and flexibility. Many cancer patients require alternative routes of analgesic administration at some time during the course of their illness.</p><p>In most patients, orally-administered, immediate-release formulations have a peak analgesic effect at 1 to 1.5 hours, while the analgesic peak with modified-release formulations is in approximately three to five hours. Some of the immediate release opioids, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a>, are also available in liquid formulations, which may be useful for patients with odynophagia or dysphagia or who can only receive medications through feeding tubes.</p><p>Oral modified-release medications should never be crushed because of the potential for &ldquo;dose dumping&rdquo; and acute toxicity. Several of the modified release opioids can &ldquo;dose dump&rdquo; if coadministered with alcohol, which can dissolve the matrix in which the drug is embedded. It is best to inform patients that alcohol consumption should be avoided during the hours around administration of each dose.</p><p>Use of the oral route may not be feasible in patients with oral mucositis, dysphagia, bowel obstruction, or severe nausea. Some of the modified release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> formulations (eg, Avinza, Kadian) are capsules that can be opened and sprinkled on food without changing the delivery characteristics; this can permit the administration of a modified-release drug through a feeding tube, if necessary, but the pellets can clog all but the largest feeding tubes. Liquid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> may be a better choice for those patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Transdermal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> is widely used for chronic pain. Each transdermal patch provides 48 to 72 hours of relatively stable drug delivery for most patients. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Fentanyl'</a> above.)</p><p>Transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> may be preferred over an orally administered opioid in the setting of poor gastrointestinal tract absorption or dysphagia, or if constipation is an issue. Transdermal fentanyl may also be preferred by patients who are distressed by the number of tablets required to manage medical disorders and for those whose adherence to treatment would be improved by use of the transdermal route.</p><p>Transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> may not be effective in patients lacking adequate adipose tissue over which the patch can be placed. In such patients, without an adequate subcutaneous drug reservoir, fentanyl serum levels may never become therapeutic, presumably because the drug is not delivered to the blood as a continuous infusion and the liver metabolizes the drug as it is presented to it. Patients with low albumin levels who have frequent infections are at risk for toxicity from transdermal fentanyl because of sudden increases in the free fraction of fentanyl along with increased absorption from the reservoir when the patient&rsquo;s temperature exceeds 102 degrees FF.</p><p>Transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> is available in some countries, including the United States. As discussed, efficacy in cancer pain has been addressed in six randomized trials, in which transdermal buprenorphine was compared with placebo, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>, or transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/3,5,7,32,82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,7,32,82,83</a>]. Although efficacy is likely, the studies were not designed to address long-term effectiveness, making the results difficult to interpret [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. The available data suggest that transdermal buprenorphine may be useful, as in patients who are relatively opioid na&iuml;ve and do not have severe pain requiring rapid dose titration; it is not generally considered first line due to the limited experience. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Partial agonists: Buprenorphine'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Rectal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasional patients are treated with rectal administration of an opioid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. In the United States, short-acting rectal formulations are available for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> (5, 10, 20, 30 mg rectal suppositories), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> (3 mg) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxymorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxymorphone</a> (5 mg). In addition, there is limited anecdotal experience in the rectal use of a long-acting modified-release formulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>].</p><p>The potency of rectally administered opioids is believed to approximate oral dosing, but absorption is variable and relative potency may be higher or lower than expected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,88</a>]. For this reason, a switch from oral to rectal dosing is usually accompanied by a reduction in the equivalent dose.

The intramuscular route is not generally used because it is painful and provides no pharmacological advantage.</p><p>Continuous SC infusion can be easily accomplished using a &ldquo;butterfly&rdquo; catheter inserted under the skin of the chest wall or abdomen; the needle can remain in place for a week or more, and any drug with an injectable formulation can be administered in this way [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methadone</a> is not preferred via the SC route as it can act as an irritant to the skin.</p><p>In order to maintain the comfort of an infusion site, the SC infusion rate should not exceed 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span>. Higher volumes can be delivered, however, if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronidase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronidase</a> is added to the infusion. In order to limit the total volume of injectate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> may be chosen over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> because of its greater water solubility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]; it is commercially available in a relatively concentrated 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/ml</span> solution for injection.</p><p>Patients receiving continuous IV or SC infusion may benefit from access to intermittent administration of a short-acting drug for breakthrough pain. The IV route has the most rapid onset of action. When administered as an IV bolus, some drugs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>, have a peak onset almost immediately, whereas other drugs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>, may require 15 to 30 minutes because of the time required to penetrate the blood-brain barrier.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H622751254\"><span class=\"h4\">Patient-controlled analgesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pump with a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) option can be used to administer continuous infusion by either the IV or SC route, and thereby facilitate the option of &ldquo;rescue doses.&rdquo; PCA devices are programmed for the size of the dose, the minimum time between doses (lockout interval), and the cumulative dose allowed in one or four hours (several times higher than the anticipated need).</p><p>Although safe and efficacious PCA settings for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> are widely accepted when this modality is used for acute postoperative pain, the settings are usually quite different when PCA is selected for cancer pain. Patients typically have a prior opioid regimen that is switched to an appropriate dose of a continuous infusion. The supplemental rescue dose administered via the PCA pump is selected to be roughly in the range of 5 to 15 percent of the total daily dose. In contrast to acute pain, the treatment of which often involves access to PCA delivered doses every six to seven minutes, the so-called lockout period when PCA is used to deliver rescue doses during chronic infusion may be longer, such as 10 to 20 minutes, although there is substantial inter-institution variability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Intrathecal and intraspinal administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Properly selected patients can benefit from more sophisticated pain management approaches, such as intraspinal opioid administration (epidural or intrathecal, collectively called &ldquo;neuraxial&rdquo; analgesia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. At least one randomized trial comparing conventional analgesic therapy with neuraxial analgesia via an implanted programmable pump in cancer patients with pain found that the intrathecal route yielded better pain control and fewer side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p>Patients whose pain has not responded to routine systemic therapy should be considered for referral to a specialist in pain management for evaluation of this and other neuraxial techniques, among other interventional strategies for pain management.

Dose individualization is the key to optimizing the outcomes of opioid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/93-97\" class=\"abstract_t\">93-97</a>].</p><p>Continuous or frequently recurrent pain is most effectively managed with a fixed schedule, &ldquo;around-the-clock&rdquo; opioid regimen, which is usually combined with &ldquo;as needed&rdquo; rescue doses for breakthrough pain. Dose titration to achieve adequate pain relief from a fixed scheduled regimen is attainable in most cases.</p><p>Conventionally, dose titration is accomplished in one of two ways. The fixed scheduled dose can be increased by 30 to 100 percent of the total dose taken in the prior 24 hour period (with the percent increase informed by the severity of the pain, the degree of medical frailty or comorbidities that may increase opioid risk, and the existing formulations). Alternatively, the fixed scheduled dose can be increased by a daily amount that is determined by averaging the total amount of supplemental rescue medication taken during the prior few days (adjusted for the estimated equianalgesic potency, if needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F111206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111206 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F111216\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111216 \">table 10</a>)). These step-wise methods of dose escalation ensure safety as the dose is increased. Caution should be exercised in adding &gt;50 percent of the total dose taken in prior days when the supplemental rescue medication is used for incident pain only or procedure-related pain such as occurs during dressing changes. Such patients will continue to require rescue doses and may become excessively somnolent in between pain exacerbations.</p><p>As a general rule, the dose of an opioid can be increased until a favorable balance between analgesia and side effects is obtained, or the patient develops intolerable and unmanageable side effects. It is accepted best practice to continue dose escalation without regard to a maximum dose unless troublesome side effects occur, observations suggest that dose incrementation will not be able to control the pain, there is excessive pill burden, or some other event occurs that indicates the need for an alternative strategy. Importantly, relatively higher doses (eg, those above 200 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> per day or its equivalent) are not commonly needed to manage cancer pain. If titration to a relatively high dose is pursued, the process should be accompanied by careful reassessment to ensure that the drug still provides benefits and that the regimen is not compromised by subtle toxicities or burdens associated with cost or number of tablets.</p><p>Ideally, the interval between dose escalations should be long enough to allow a new steady state (which requires five to six half-lives, irrespective of the route or drug) to be approached following each dose adjustment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two to three days for the modified-release oral formulations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three to six days for the transdermal patch.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although five days is usually sufficient to judge the full effect of a change in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> dose, the variability of this drug's half-life means that occasional patients will require much longer periods (up to several weeks) to ensure that effects have become stable. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Methadone'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>For patients with severe pain, more rapid dose escalation is needed. However, when doses are escalated at intervals shorter than those necessary to approach steady state (five to six half-lives), there is a possibility of &quot;overshooting&quot;. In this phenomenon, the patient undergoing rapid dose titration reports benefit, but continuation of the successful dose later results in toxicity as drug levels continue to rise toward steady state.</p><p>When rapid dose titration is needed to address poorly controlled pain, the risk of overshooting should be assessed. The risks are greater when the drug has a relatively long half-life (the greatest concern is with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>) or the patient is medically frail. In some cases, hospitalization should be considered for the express purpose of monitoring aggressive escalation of the dose. Hospitalization during a period of particularly intense pain, or &ldquo;pain crisis,&rdquo; is a medically appropriate option for selected patents.</p><p>As the dose of the fixed schedule opioid regimen is increased, the dose of the &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; drug also must be increased. In most cases, the dose of this short-acting medication should remain in the range of 5 to 15 percent of the total daily dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. The exception to this is found when using the rapid-onset transmucosal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> formulations, which may have effects at doses that are not proportional to the fixed schedule dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. In the case of these drugs, the starting dose should be low and dose titration should ascend with the commercially available dose units, stopping at a level associated with benefit. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Management of breakthrough pain'</a> above.)</p><p>As higher opioid doses are reached, there may be a temptation to apply excessive caution during further titration. An understanding of the pharmacology of these drugs should provide the reassurance necessary to avoid undertreatment, as illustrated by the following illustrative case.</p><p>A patient with slowly progressive breast cancer, who has undergone several periods of opioid dose adjustment because of worsening pain, is taking long-acting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a> 240 mg twice daily plus &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; doses consisting of five tablets of short-acting oxycodone 5 mg (25 mg per dose); on each day, approximately four rescue doses are needed. She has no side effects except for constipation, which has been controlled with laxatives. When her pain worsens again, she is assessed, and in the absence of unmanageable side effects, the decision is made to further escalate the dose. Her total daily dose of oxycodone has been 480 mg (long-acting) plus 100 mg (rescue) or 580 mg. There are two approaches to dose increase:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One approach to increasing the dose is to add 30 to 50 percent to the total daily dose (30 percent of 580 = 174). The largest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a> tablet is 80 mg, and an increase of 30 percent can be easily accomplished by adding one 80 mg tablet to each of the fixed doses: a fixed regimen of 320 mg twice daily. The rescue dose can be changed to 35 mg per dose at the same time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The alternative approach, adding the total daily rescue dose, or 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in this case, to the fixed scheduled dose yields a more conservative outcome but still one in the range to be useful.</p><p/><p>Both strategies are appropriate and safe; any smaller increment is unlikely to be beneficial.</p><p>This case illustrates a typical pattern observed during long-term treatment of cancer pain. The opioid dose is usually maintained for a prolonged time, unless there is progression in the pain-producing pathology. Recurrent pain or the new occurrence of side effects necessitates a new assessment, and often, another period of dose titration. Although the use of relatively high doses requires careful reevaluation, the absolute dose of the opioid is inconsequential as long as the balance between analgesia and side effects remains acceptable for the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain that respond poorly to opioids alone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a patient&rsquo;s pain is poorly responsive to an opioid, it might be related to the type of pain (neuropathic pain may not respond completely to opioid therapy alone and may be better approached with adjuvant analgesics) or other issues, such as a high propensity to develop side effects (eg, presence of preexisting cognitive impairment, frail older adults). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management: Adjuvant analgesics (coanalgesics)&quot;, section on 'Neuropathic pain'</a>.) </p><p>Furthermore, most patients receiving opioids for cancer pain experience analgesia along with one or more side effects. When side effects predominate and overwhelm the benefits produced by the drug, the patient is said to have opioid poorly responsive pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,101</a>]. Clinicians must be attuned to this possibility, recognize it promptly, assess potential contributors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F90182\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90182 \">table 11</a>), and be prepared to offer an alternative strategy for pain management.</p><p>The initial steps include conducting a thorough pain assessment, including questions about psychological and spiritual concerns. If substance abuse is suspected, a detailed history relevant to substance abuse outcomes (nonadherence, addiction, and diversion) should be done.

This may involve any one of a large number of options (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F75273\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75273 \">table 12</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>], each of which must be evaluated in terms of benefit and burden, within the context of the larger goals of care.

The rationale for this strategy is based on pharmacologic and clinical observations that suggest that a change in drug is more likely than not to improve the balance between pain relief and side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h4\">Equianalgesic opioid dose conversion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each opioid drug has a different potency, defined as the dose necessary to produce a given effect. When switching from one opioid to another, the starting dose of the new drug must be informed by the difference in their relative potencies.

Due to cost and limited experience, the transmucosal drugs are generally considered only after a patient has demonstrated a poor response to an oral rescue dose. Patients with very rapid onset pain might also be considered for an early trial. Given the lack of comparative data, there are no recommendations about which of the many formulations might be preferable.
