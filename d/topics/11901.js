In the United States, nontyphoidal salmonellosis is one of the leading causes of foodborne disease. <em>Salmonella enteritidis</em> and <em>Salmonella typhimurium</em> are among the serotypes most frequently isolated. <em>Salmonella</em> is most commonly associated with ingestion of poultry, eggs, and milk products. However, nontyphoidal salmonellae have also been associated with fresh produce, meats, and other foodstuff, as well as contact with pets, including reptiles, and other animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nontyphoidal-salmonella-microbiology-and-epidemiology#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nontyphoidal Salmonella: Microbiology and epidemiology&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2717158\"><span class=\"h2\">Incubation period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of <em>Salmonella</em> gastroenteritis typically occur within 8 to 72 hours following exposure, usually ingestion of contaminated food or water. However, longer incubation periods have been reported in some outbreaks, potentially as a result of exposure to a lower bacterial dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1058721067\"><span class=\"h2\">General features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastroenteritis due to salmonellae is clinically indistinguishable from gastroenteritis caused by many other pathogens. Furthermore, enteric infection with nontyphoidal salmonellae may be clinically mild or even asymptomatic, which can complicate clinical decisions about treatment interventions. (See <a href=\"#H1058722184\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic carriage'</a> below.)</p><p>The cardinal features include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever, and abdominal cramping. A higher ingested dose of bacteria correlates with severity of diarrhea, the duration of illness, and weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although there have been descriptions of clinical characteristics associated with salmonellosis (eg, &quot;pea soup&quot; diarrhea), there are no clinical characteristics that reliably distinguish <em>Salmonella</em> infection from other forms of gastroenteritis. The diarrhea is typically not grossly bloody, although bloody stools can be seen, particularly among children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p>Other constitutional symptoms (fatigue, malaise, chills), weight loss, and headaches are also commonly described. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2716953\"><span class=\"h2\">Course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nontyphoidal <em>Salmonella</em> gastroenteritis is usually self-limited.

Bacteremia can lead to a variety of extraintestinal manifestations such as endocarditis, mycotic aneurysm, visceral abscesses, and osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Two species, <em>Salmonella</em> <em>choleraesuis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>] and <em>Salmonella heidelberg</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], appear to be more invasive than others. In addition, antibiotic resistant strains of <em>S. typhimurium</em> are associated with a two- to threefold increase in the risk of bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/10,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16</a>].

The definitive diagnosis of <em>Salmonella</em> gastroenteritis requires isolation of the pathogen in stool cultures from such patients, although stool cultures are not always warranted. Indications for stool cultures in a patient presenting with acute diarrhea include severe illness, immunocompromising conditions, and comorbidities that increase the risk for complications; these indications are discussed elsewhere. Patients at the extremes of age are more likely to have complications in the setting of <em>Salmonella</em> gastroenteritis. Blood cultures should generally be obtained in such individuals, particularly if they remain ill or febrile by the time stool culture results return. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nontyphoidal-salmonella-microbiology-and-epidemiology#H1058725303\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nontyphoidal Salmonella: Microbiology and epidemiology&quot;, section on 'Risk for severe disease'</a>.)</p><p>Laboratory isolation of salmonellae from stool usually requires a minimum of 48 hours; 72 hours is needed if overnight enrichment broth incubation is used in addition to primary plating of stool samples. Salmonellae are gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic Enterobacteriaceae, which are differentiated from the normal gram-negative flora of the intestinal tract, in part, by the color of the colonies on indicator plates. The sensitivity and specificity of single or multiple stool cultures for diagnosis of salmonellosis are unknown. Enrichment broths (tetrathionate or selenite) are used to facilitate identification of <em>Salmonella</em> when low numbers of organisms are present. Overnight incubation in these broths inhibits the growth of <em>Escherichia coli</em> but not <em>Salmonella</em>. Highly sensitive multiplex nucleic acid amplification tests are commercially available for detection of <em>Salmonella</em> and other enteric pathogens in stool samples, though their clinical utility and cost remain uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

The other major causes of acute infectious diarrhea include viruses (eg, norovirus, rotavirus, adenoviruses, astrovirus), other bacteria (eg, <em>Campylobacter</em>, <em>Shigella</em>, Shiga-toxin producing <em>E. coli</em>, <em>Vibrio</em>, <em>Clostridium difficile</em>), and protozoa (eg, cryptosporidium, giardia, cyclospora, entamoeba). It is difficult to distinguish infections caused by the different pathogens on the basis of clinical features alone, but identifying a pathogen is not always warranted for clinical management. The differential diagnosis and approach to acute diarrhea are discussed in detail elsewhere.

As noted above, the illness is usually self<strong>-</strong>limited; in addition, the vast majority of <em>Salmonella</em> infections are undiagnosed and are not associated with complications. Antimicrobial therapy (typically fluoroquinolones) may be warranted for those with severe disease or risk factors for invasive disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H52930749\"><span class=\"h2\">Supportive management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most critical therapy in diarrheal illness is hydration, preferably by the oral route with solutions that contain water, salt, and sugar. This is discussed in detail elsewhere.

The following sections discuss approach to antimicrobial therapy for patients who have documented <em>Salmonella</em> gastrointestinal infection. The issue of empiric antimicrobial therapy for infectious diarrhea in general is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-limited-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-limited countries&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-limited-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with acute diarrhea in resource-limited countries&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment of extraintestinal <em>Salmonella</em> infections is also discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nontyphoidal-salmonella-bacteremia#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nontyphoidal Salmonella bacteremia&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H52930797\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We generally do not recommend antibiotic treatment for immunocompetent individuals between 12 months and 50 years of age who have documented <em>Salmonella</em> gastroenteritis with mild to moderate symptoms, as the illness is typically self-limited. A meta-analysis of 12 trials that included 767 otherwise healthy individuals with nontyphoidal <em>Salmonella</em> gastroenteritis found no significant benefit from antimicrobial therapy on the duration of illness, diarrhea, or fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The main risks of treatment include the adverse effects of the antimicrobial agent (including overall antimicrobial resistance pressure) and the potential for extending asymptomatic <em>Salmonella</em> carriage. (See <a href=\"#H52933079\" class=\"local\">'Risk from prior antimicrobial therapy'</a> below.) </p><p>However, there are certain clinical settings in which therapy for <em>Salmonella</em> gastrointestinal infection is warranted, specifically for treatment of severe disease and for pre-emptive treatment in immunocompromised patients and those at the extremes of age, who are at higher risk of complications (eg, bacteremia, focal infection, or persisting symptoms). In these patients, the potential for improvement of severe illness and prevention of complications seems to outweigh the risks of antibiotic treatment, although this has not been definitively demonstrated in large, randomized placebo-controlled trials. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe illness</strong> &mdash; Antimicrobial treatment is appropriate in severely ill immunocompetent individuals, although the decision to treat should be individualized.

Many patients with salmonellosis have occult blood detectable in stool samples, while overtly bloody stools are more likely to be due to <em>Shigella</em> or enterohemorrhagic <em>E. coli</em>, the latter for which antibiotic treatment has been associated with Shiga-toxin mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome.

Neonates with gastroenteritis, particularly those born prematurely <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to mothers with gastroenteritis, are at risk and may not appear toxic or acutely ill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/15,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,24,25</a>]. <em>Salmonella</em> meningitis is a feared complication that occurs primarily in infants and has a high case fatality rate and significant rate of neurologic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In most cases, infants less than three months of age should receive antimicrobial therapy for symptomatic salmonellosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]; in addition, some experts treat all children younger than one to two years old unless the child is afebrile and clinically improving at the time the culture results become available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Adults over 50, particularly those with known atherosclerotic disease, are at higher risk of endovascular infection and aortitis if bacteremia develops.

It is impossible to know precisely how many patients with immunocompromising conditions who get mild to moderate gastrointestinal salmonellosis go on to develop bacteremia and complications. However, it is likely to be a significant percentage and a cause for worry. As an example, in two studies (one from Malawi and the other from Taiwan), 31 and 43 percent of HIV-infected antiretroviral-na&iuml;ve adults developed recurrent <em>Salmonella</em> bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. A subsequent study demonstrated that successful initiation antiretroviral treatment (ART) following <em>Salmonella</em> infection, with a decrease in the plasma HIV viral level by &ge;2 log<sub>10</sub> after four weeks, is associated with a reduced risk of recurrence, even without suppressive antibiotics, compared with those who had a poor virologic response after ART initiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The association between these host factors and more severe disease are discussed in detail elsewhere.

This has been the range of durations evaluated in most studies of empiric treatment of severe community-acquired diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. </p><p>The duration of therapy for immunocompetent patients who are treated because of age or underlying vascular or joint disease has not been studied. Most experts would recommend 3 to 14 days of treatment depending upon the specific clinical situation, suspicion of bacteremia, laboratory findings, and microbiological data. </p><p>Overall, it is prudent to limit the exposure to antibiotics in immunocompetent hosts because of the potential for antibiotics to paradoxically prolong carriage and cause adverse drug reactions, and because of concerns about antibiotic resistance in general.

Because salmonellae persist in the reticuloendothelial system, and these groups of patients have impaired immune clearance mechanisms (especially those with advanced HIV or organ transplants), a longer duration of therapy seems advisable.

Also, in this endemic setting for nontyphoidal salmonellosis, antibiotic use was associated with selection of drug-resistant <em>Salmonella</em>. Nevertheless, for certain individuals with chronic carriage (more than one year), a prolonged course of antibiotic therapy may be warranted to attempt eradication.

Non-fluoroquinolone antibiotics have been associated with an increased risk of subsequent <em>Salmonella</em> carriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. The risk with fluoroquinolone antibiotics is uncertain because of conflicting data, due in part to differences in culture techniques, culture intervals, infecting strains, and duration of follow-up. </p><p>Studies performed in the pre-quinolone era demonstrated that antimicrobial therapy of <em>Salmonella</em> gastroenteritis prolonged the duration of <em>Salmonella</em> excretion. As an example, in a 1980 study of children and infants treated with five days of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>, or placebo for uncomplicated <em>Salmonella </em>gastroenteritis, 53 percent of those who received antibiotics had bacteriologic relapse compared with none who received placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Of those who relapsed, 38 percent had recurrent diarrhea. This paradoxical finding has been thought to be due to the deleterious effect of antibiotics on normal intestinal flora, which protects against colonization with enteric pathogens. Prolongation of carriage is not related to the emergence of organisms resistant to the antimicrobial agent used, which is a relatively rare event. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Salmonella gastroenteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fluoroquinolones were anticipated to be more effective in eliminating convalescent carriage. This hypothesis was evaluated in two small randomized placebo-controlled treatment studies of outbreaks of <em>Salmonella</em> gastroenteritis using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norfloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norfloxacin</a> (400 mg twice daily for seven days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>] or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> (750 mg twice daily for 14 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Neither of the treatment regimens in these studies decreased or prolonged the duration of carriage. In contrast, a deleterious effect of norfloxacin was noted in the patients with salmonellosis treated in a placebo-controlled trial of empiric treatment for acute diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In this study, receipt of norfloxacin was associated with a lower incidence of clearance of <em>Salmonella</em> stool culture at 12 to 17 days (18 versus 49 percent with placebo). Norfloxacin was also associated with a longer time to negative cultures (median 50 versus 23 days).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H52933045\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic carriage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic carriage of nontyphoidal <em>Salmonella</em> is defined as the shedding of a <em>Salmonella</em> species for more than one year, as documented by an initial positive culture of a stool sample obtained at least one month after resolution of the acute illness and repeat positive cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Chronic carriage appears to occur rarely (0.2 to 0.6 percent in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]) in otherwise healthy subjects but may occur somewhat more frequently in young children, older individuals, women, and those with biliary tract abnormalities, especially gallstones. Chronic carriage is often identified incidentally, as part of public health follow-up, or when episodic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms prompt additional testing.</p><p>If chronic carriage is documented, attempted eradication may rarely be needed for employment or other social reasons like daycare attendance or the presence of a severely immunosuppressed family member. Eradication may also be warranted for immunosuppressed patients, particularly those with advanced HIV infection, who are at higher risk of complications from <em>Salmonella</em> infection. It is possible that chronic carriage of nontyphoidal <em>Salmonella</em> is associated with gall bladder and other cancers, as seen with chronic <em>S. typhi</em> carriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallbladder cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Salmonella'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to short-term antibiotics, which can prolong the duration of <em>Salmonella</em> carriage post-infection when given for symptomatic gastroenteritis and has not been demonstrated to eradicate carriage when given to asymptomatic individuals, long-term antimicrobial therapy may be of some utility in patients who have prolonged or chronic carriage. The optimal approach to chronic carriage of nontyphoidal <em>Salmonella</em> has not been well studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Drawing upon the experience with treating carriage of <em>S. typhi</em>, four to six weeks of antimicrobial therapy is a reasonable approach, although many patients may have side effects related to treatment. When attempting eradication of carriage, we use a fluoroquinolone (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> 500 mg orally twice daily or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> 500 mg orally once daily) for four weeks. Alternative regimens that have successfully eradicated <em>S. typhi</em> in some patients include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/800</span> mg orally twice daily) for three months or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> (3 to 5 g orally in four divided doses) for six weeks (depending upon susceptibilities of the isolate). A combination of cholecystectomy plus antibiotic therapy is probably most effective but does not guarantee carriage will be eradicated.

However, there is no evidence that such individuals are a major source of outbreaks when asymptomatic, and there is no evidence that screening for asymptomatic carriage in such individuals is effective in reducing transmission. Hand hygiene and general infection control practices remain the most important aspects of preventing spread of <em>Salmonella</em>.</p><p>Large numbers of asymptomatic transient <em>Salmonella </em>excreters are undoubtedly employed in the healthcare and food industries worldwide for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial episode of <em>Salmonella</em> gastroenteritis may be clinically mild and remain undiagnosed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median duration of <em>Salmonella</em> excretion after gastroenteritis is five weeks and excretion is frequently episodic (see <a href=\"#H52933039\" class=\"local\">'Short-term carriage following infection'</a> above) </p><p/><p>Nevertheless, in one study, only 2 percent of 566 outbreaks of salmonellosis in the United Kingdom were traced to specific infected food handlers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

A similar approach may be locally mandated, or instituted during outbreaks in daycare centers, but scrupulous attention to proper infection control procedures are most important. While reassuring, a single negative stool culture does not ensure that the individual is no longer shedding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Obtaining multiple negative stool cultures from employees may be warranted occasionally in individuals whose work requires direct handling of food that is to be consumed without further cooking, or direct contact with infants or immunosuppressed patients. However, it does not seem reasonable to routinely implement this approach for employees with lower risk occupations.

Other <em>Salmonella</em> serotypes are collectively known as nontyphoidal salmonellae and are frequently isolated from the stool of patients with gastroenteritis. <em>Salmonella</em> infection is most commonly associated with ingestion of poultry, eggs, and milk products, but many other food products and animal contacts are also sources of infection. These are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Gastroenteritis due to salmonellae is clinically indistinguishable from gastroenteritis caused by other pathogens, and definitive diagnosis requires isolation of <em>Salmonella</em> on stool cultures. However, identifying a pathogen is not always warranted for clinical management of acute diarrhea. Indications for stool cultures in a patient presenting with acute diarrhea include severe illness, immunocompromising conditions, and comorbidities that increase the risk for complications.

(See <a href=\"#H1058721980\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For immunocompetent individuals with severe gastrointestinal, non-bacteremic <em>Salmonella</em> infection that warrants antibiotic therapy, three to seven days of treatment is generally appropriate. For immunocompetent patients who are given antibiotics because of age or underlying vascular or joint disease, 3 to 14 days of treatment is reasonable depending upon the specific clinical situation, suspicion of bacteremia, laboratory findings, and microbiological data. It is appropriate to treat immunocompromised patients for a longer duration (eg, 14 days or even for weeks to months) in an effort to prevent persistent or relapsing infection. (See <a href=\"#H52930790\" class=\"local\">'Duration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic convalescent excretion of <em>Salmonella </em>is extremely common after either symptomatic or asymptomatic nontyphoidal <em>Salmonella</em> infection, and routine follow-up cultures are <strong>not</strong> warranted after uncomplicated <em>Salmonella</em> gastroenteritis in immunocompetent patients, particularly if symptoms have resolved. Immunocompromised patients may warrant special consideration. (See <a href=\"#H52933039\" class=\"local\">'Short-term carriage following infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, chronic carriage of nontyphoidal <em>Salmonella</em> (shedding of a <em>Salmonella</em> species for more than one year) is rare in otherwise healthy individuals but may occur in older individuals and those with biliary tract abnormalities, especially gallstones. The optimal approach to chronic carriage of nontyphoidal <em>Salmonella</em> has not been well studied; based on evidence from patients with chronic <em>S. typhi</em> carriage, four to six weeks of antimicrobial therapy is a reasonable approach. Cholecystectomy may also be warranted. (See <a href=\"#H52933045\" class=\"local\">'Chronic carriage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is customary for food handlers and healthcare workers with <em>Salmonella </em>gastroenteritis to remain home from work while symptoms persist because of the risk of transmission. However, there is no evidence that such individuals are a major source of outbreaks or infection when asymptomatic. Hand hygiene and general infection control practices remain the most important aspects of preventing spread of <em>Salmonella</em>. Practitioners should be aware of the need to comply with local public health requirements, which vary. (See <a href=\"#H52934057\" class=\"local\">'Food handlers and healthcare workers'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Faulder KE, Simmonds K, Robinson JL.
