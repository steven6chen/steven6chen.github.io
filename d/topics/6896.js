The clinical manifestations, theories of pathogenesis, evaluation, and diagnosis of EIAn and food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIAn) will be reviewed here. The management and prognosis of EIAn and FDEIAn are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-induced anaphylaxis: Management and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-induced-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food-induced anaphylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1640760\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaphylaxis, from any cause, is defined as a serious allergic or hypersensitivity reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

This definition has been used for several decades, although work in the pathophysiology of FDEIAn has raised the question of whether exercise is absolutely necessary for the development of symptoms.

Early signs and symptoms typically include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffuse warmth <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> flushing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generalized pruritus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urticaria (hives are usually 10 to 15 mm in diameter or larger, rather than the &quot;punctate&quot; hives normally seen in <span class=\"nowrap\">cholinergic/heat-induced</span> urticaria)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden fatigue</p><p/><p>If exercise continues, there is a progression to more severe symptoms, including one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angioedema of the face <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extremities (often the hands)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laryngeal edema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> collapse</p><p/><p>Bronchospasm is reported in some patients, although it may be less common in EIAn than in anaphylaxis from other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Some patients experience headache that can persist for hours to days after the attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis (from any cause) are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cessation of exercise usually results in improvement or resolution of symptoms. Perhaps for this reason, reports of fatality are limited to a few cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. However, it is possible that fatal episodes may be underdiagnosed or mistaken for other causes of sudden death during exercise.</p><p>Although stopping activity usually prevents progression of the attack, patients often do not instinctively stop exertion when they first experience symptoms. Instead, many try to run for help, which typically precipitates a dramatic worsening of symptoms. Patients should be educated about the importance of immediate cessation of activity.

Most patients exercise regularly but experience attacks only occasionally. A minority of individuals experience symptoms with most attempts at exercise. Still other patients have one or two attacks over a span of several years, although such infrequent attacks should prompt a careful evaluation for undetected cotriggers and cofactors. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Other cofactors'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Triggering activities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vigorous forms of exercise, such as jogging, racquet sports, dancing, and aerobics, are most often implicated, although lower levels of exertion (eg, brisk walking or yard work) are capable of triggering attacks in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As an example, the exertion of crossing the street was sufficient to trigger symptoms in some older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103649304\"><span class=\"h2\">Implicated foods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The foods most commonly implicated in FDEIAn are wheat, other grains, and nuts in Western populations and wheat and shellfish in Asian populations; however, an array of culprit foods has been reported, including fruits, vegetables, seeds, legumes, and, less often, various meats, cow's milk, and egg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,12-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12-20</a>]. The amount of food ingested is important in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Most patients develop symptoms only after eating a specific food, although a few have attacks if any food (usually solids rather than liquids) has been ingested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Rare patients have been described in whom symptoms only occurred if two foods were eaten together before exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The processing of the food may be critical in some cases. In one report, a patient developed FDEIAn with tofu but could tolerate soy milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Immunoblotting identified beta-conglycinin as the main allergen. Pepsin digestion readily degraded the beta-conglycinin in soy milk, but the same allergen in tofu was resistant to pepsin digestion, suggesting that this difference in allergen stability was fundamental to the patient's presentation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Other cofactors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients develop symptoms more readily in the presence of one or more additional cofactors, although exercise remains the immediate inciting factor.

Each case was investigated and confirmed. In this population, the prevalences of EIAn and FDEIAn were 0.03 and 0.017 percent, respectively. There was no apparent gender predilection in EIAn, whereas FDEIAn was more often identified in boys, contrary to the gender ratio noted above. EIAn and FDEIAn are usually sporadic, although familial cases have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">THEORIES OF PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous mast cell degranulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>] and transient elevations in plasma histamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>] and serum tryptase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>] have been documented in patients with EIAn and food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIAn).

Omega-5 gliadin, a protein component of gluten, has been identified as an important allergen in this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], as well as in wheat allergy causing anaphylaxis independent of exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

In 14 of 16, objective reactions (most commonly urticaria) could be elicited with some combination of larger amounts of gluten-rich bread, aspirin, and alcohol, even in the absence of exercise. These findings suggest that exercise is simply another cofactor for the clinical expression of an underlying food allergy and not an absolute requirement for symptoms. The authors suggested the term &quot;augmentation factor-triggered food allergy&quot; instead of FDEIAn. Another interesting finding in this study was that gastric and intestinal permeability in patients with FDEIAn, as measured by absorption of nondigestible sugars, did not appear to differ from that in normal controls, either as baseline or during exercise.

Thus, a negative test does not exclude FDEIAn. The amount of food, the interval between food ingestion and exercise, and the intensity of the exercise may all be important factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,21,22,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,21,22,61</a>].

Each of these patients gave the history of reacting only to the combination of wheat and exercise. Because the intent of this study was to determine if exercise was absolutely required for reactions, patients were challenged sequentially with and without cofactors and exercise. Patients ingested between 10 and 80 grams of gluten-enriched bread, in response to which four developed symptoms. Another 10 subjects required wheat ingestion plus premedication with 500 to 1000 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and 10 to 30 mL of 95 percent alcohol to develop symptoms.

Urticaria is elicited by raising the core body temperature. Patients may experience symptoms with exercise but also upon exposure to factors that passively increase body temperature, such as hot showers or saunas, very strong emotion, or very spicy food. Symptoms of cholinergic urticaria are usually limited to the skin, although generalized symptoms can occur if cutaneous mast cell mediators are released in sufficient amounts and diffuse into the systemic circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>].

Thus, it must be determined that a patient with suspected FDEIAn does indeed tolerate the food in the absence of exercise. A formal food challenge should be performed to determine tolerance if the patient cannot report tolerating portion-sized amounts of the food in question in the absence of exercise SINCE the last episode of anaphylaxis. In light of new developments in the pathogenesis of FDEIAn, it is possible that FDEIAn is actually a subclinical form food allergy that only results in symptoms in the presence of additional cofactors (exercise, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], alcohol, physical or emotional stress).
