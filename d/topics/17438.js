VEGF-targeting agents have unique toxicities that differ from those of traditional chemotherapy. Toxicities of antiangiogenic agents may be classified as VEGF class-specific, drug class-specific (eg, associated with antiangiogenic TKIs), or agent-specific. (See <a href=\"#H112181231\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many of these adverse effects, particularly the cardiovascular effects, can be serious and potentially fatal.

The overall incidence of all-grade hypertension is approximately 22 to 25 percent, with severe hypertension in 7 to 8 percent.
