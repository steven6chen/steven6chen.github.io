Although the esophagus is the most frequently affected part of the GI tract, any part of the GI tract may be involved. Severe involvement occurs in less than 10 percent of patients and is associated with an unfavorable prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastrointestinal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. This topic will review the management of GI disease associated with SSc. Our approach is generally consistent with clinical practice guidelines for the management of common SSc manifestations affecting the GI tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastrointestinal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The pathogenesis, pathology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of GI manifestations of SSc are discussed separately.

Regular dental hygiene is necessary to help prevent dental caries. Patients with decreased oral aperture may be able to improve gingival help using adaptive oral hygiene devices (eg, flossers, oscillating-rotating toothbrushes) combined with facial exercises to increase the oral mouth opening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastrointestinal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-saliva-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Artificial saliva</a> may be used in patients who also have sicca syndrome.

However, patients with SSc often have more severe symptoms.</p><p>While lifestyle and dietary modification should be recommended in all patients with GERD, these measures are usually inadequate by themselves. These measures include elevation of the head of the bed and selective elimination of dietary triggers (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Lifestyle and dietary modification'</a>). Calcium channel blockers and anticholinergic agents, which may be used to treat other manifestations of SSc, can potentially worsen reflux.</p><p>Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective drugs for the treatment of GERD in SSc and should be used in symptomatic patients. Patients who fail to respond to once-daily PPI therapy should be treated with twice-daily PPI therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastrointestinal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. One study in patients with SSc found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> healed esophagitis and reduced elevated hydroxyproline levels to normal, suggesting some reversal of esophageal fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastrointestinal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Patients on long-term PPI therapy may develop adverse effects that require additional monitoring (eg, hypomagnesemia, vitamin B12 deficiency). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults#H671603146\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Severe or frequent symptoms or erosive esophagitis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proton-pump-inhibitors-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-acid-related-disorders#H59974871\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Proton pump inhibitors: Overview of use and adverse effects in the treatment of acid related disorders&quot;, section on 'Adverse effects'</a>.)</p><p>Patients who fail to respond to twice-daily PPI therapy are considered to have refractory GERD and should be referred to a gastroenterologist. We add a H2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) at bedtime in patients who failed PPI twice daily. H2RA can reduce gastroesophageal reflux, improve symptoms, and treat mild erosive esophagitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastrointestinal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, the development of tachyphylaxis limits their use as maintenance therapy for GERD, although regular short drug holidays may help reduce this problem. In addition, H2 blockers alone are less effective as compared with PPIs in treating GERD and are ineffective in patients with severe esophagitis. We therefore generally reserve H2RA to reduce nocturnal acid breakthrough in patients who are refractory to PPI therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults#H1097903516\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in adults&quot;, section on 'PPI refractory symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>Prokinetic agents have not been found to be beneficial except in patients who have GERD due to delayed gastric emptying.</p><p>Surgery for gastroesophageal reflux, such as with gastric fundoplication, is relatively contraindicated in patients with SSc because of the high incidence of postoperative dysphagia (38 to 71 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastrointestinal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Its use is generally limited to patients with severe, refractory reflux. Unfortunately, the recurrence rate with surgery is also high. In one study involving 20 SSc patients, reflux esophagitis recurred in all patients at an average of four years after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastrointestinal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A retrospective review of 23 SSc patients undergoing surgery for GERD comparing fundoplication, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and esophagectomy found improved control of reflux symptoms with Roux-en-Y compared with the other surgical techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastrointestinal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, surgical antireflux techniques have not been well-studied in patients with SSc and should be avoided or pursued with caution. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of gastroesophageal reflux in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Esophageal motility disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Esophageal dysmotility can present as dysphagia or a sensation of food being stuck in the throat. In patients with persistent symptoms despite twice-daily PPI therapy, we suggest a trial of prokinetic drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a>, cisapride, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=domperidone-united-states-available-via-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">domperidone</a>) to relieve these symptoms. These drugs act by increasing esophageal sphincter pressure, improving peristalsis, and enhancing gastric emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastrointestinal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Cisapride acts to release acetylcholine within the myenteric plexus. Although cisapride is better tolerated as compared with metoclopramide, its use has been associated with important drug interactions with medications metabolized by the cytochrome P450-3A4 isoenzyme (eg, macrolide antibiotics, antifungals, and phenothiazines) resulting in cardiac arrhythmias and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastrointestinal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In the United States, prescriptions for cisapride can only be filled through an investigational limited access program from the manufacturer after providing documentation as to need for cisapride and assessment of risk factors for cardiac arrhythmias in the individual patient (eg, a QTc &gt;450 ms). However, cisapride is available in several other countries. Domperidone is only available in the United States under a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug application, and may also increase the QT interval and cause fatal arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastrointestinal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Erythromycin acts as a motilin agonist which increases gastric contractions and lowers esophageal sphincter pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastrointestinal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

The latter can increase the risk of potentially fatal cisapride-induced torsade de pointes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastrointestinal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Endoscopic coagulation with argon plasma coagulation (APC), heater probe, bipolar probe, laser therapy, or radiofrequency ablation obliterates the vascular ectasia and decreases the degree of bleeding. APC is used widely due to its ease of use and perceived safety advantages. Antrectomy prevents recurrent bleeding but is usually reserved for patients who fail multiple sessions of endoscopic therapy. There have been reports of benefit in some cases from immunosuppression that suggest that disease-modifying therapy may be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastrointestinal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Adequate antimicrobial coverage can be achieved with several different antibiotic regimens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F107297\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107297 \">table 1</a>). Bacterial culture with sensitivity testing is not helpful since various bacterial species with different antibiotic sensitivities coexist. In addition, many bacterial species in the gut cannot be grown in culture.

While some patients may remain asymptomatic for many months after a 7- to 10-day course of treatment, others require prolonged antibiotics for severe persistent diarrhea. Patients with SSc often have recurrent SIBO and require intermittent courses of therapy, and others need treatment on a regular basis (such as the first 5 to 10 days out of every month or every other week). Antibiotics are usually rotated (antibiotic change every four weeks with occasional &quot;antibiotic holiday&quot;), since continuous therapy with one agent may result in the emergence of resistant organisms and an increase in relapse rate. When diarrhea recurs in a patient still on antibiotics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> can be added for five to seven days to treat anaerobic flora.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Dysmotility and intestinal pseudo-obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prokinetics may be useful for acute and chronic therapy of intestinal pseudo-obstruction. In addition, patients with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) require nutritional support and antibiotics for concurrent SIBO.

Malnutrition in SSc patients may be due to loss of appetite, physical challenges of eating, oral symptoms, drug side effects, gastroparesis, CIPO or malabsorption secondary to bacterial overgrowth, and, rarely, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Referral for specialist nutritional advice should be considered in any SSc case with significant features of malnutrition or weight loss once other causes have been excluded. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal manifestations of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with malabsorption and steatorrhea should be on a lactose-free diet that is low in dietary long-chain fatty acids (&lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span>. Long-chain fatty acids should be substituted with medium-chain triglycerides. In patients with malnutrition despite dietary modification, an elemental diet or medium-chain triglyceride supplements should be instituted. Some patients require supplementation of fat- and water-soluble vitamins, calcium, and iron. Patients with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency require exogenous pancreatic enzymes.

Biofeedback may improve fecal incontinence in patients with manometric evidence of weakness of the external anal sphincter or decreased ability to perceive rectal distension because of nerve injury. Local injection of synthetic biopolymer may improve sphincter function in patients with passive incontinence.

Although the esophagus is the most frequently affected part of the GI tract, any part of the GI tract may be involved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use largely supportive therapies for oral manifestations of SSc, including facial exercises for tight skin, attentive dental care, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-saliva-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial saliva</a> and other interventions for sicca symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Oropharyngeal disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of esophageal disease is largely directed toward the amelioration of symptoms of heartburn and dysphagia which may be due to esophageal dysmotility or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its complications (eg, strictures, esophagitis). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Esophageal disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of gastroparesis consists of dietary modification, optimization of glycemic control in patients with diabetes, hydration, and in patients with continued symptoms, pharmacologic therapy with prokinetic and antiemetics. In patients with gastric antral venous ectasia (GAVE), endoscopic ablation may be required to decrease the degree of bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Gastric disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prokinetics may be useful for acute and chronic therapy of intestinal pseudo-obstruction. In addition, patients with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) require nutritional support and antibiotics for concurrent small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). The role of surgery is limited to providing access for venting and feeding. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Small intestinal disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malnutrition in SSc patients may be due to loss of appetite, physical challenges of eating, oral symptoms, drug side effects, gastroparesis, CIPO or malabsorption secondary to bacterial overgrowth, and, rarely, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mainstay of treatment of SIBO is antibiotic therapy. In patients with significant malnutrition in whom some bowel function is preserved, percutaneous gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube can be used to administer enteral nutrition and venting for symptomatic relief. In patients with severe dysmotility and pseudo-obstruction, parenteral nutrition is often necessary.
