Genetic predisposition is the dominant risk factor for a small proportion of individuals; however, environmental factors (including diet, exercise, smoking, and obesity) are stronger risk factors in most people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A family history of CRC is common among the general population. In the United States, between 5 and 10 percent of adults (aged 20 to 79 years) report having a first-degree relative with CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]; other countries have reported rates that are somewhat higher, with one study from the Netherlands reporting that 11.7 percent of adults aged 30 to 70 years had at least one first-degree relative with CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This rate increases with age, reflecting the increasing chance that relatives will develop CRC as they get older.</p><p>One in four patients with CRC is at moderately increased risk because of a family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Approximately 3 to 4 percent of patients with newly diagnosed CRC have very high risk due to a cancer susceptibility syndrome caused by one of two autosomal dominant, highly penetrant genetic mutations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lynch Syndrome, also called hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), accounts for about 2 to 3 percent of CRC and an increased risk of other cancers as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-adenomatous-polyposis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Less frequent hereditary syndromes with increased risk for CRC include MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP), juvenile polyposis syndrome, Cowden syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, attenuated FAP (AFAP), Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and serrated (hyperplastic) polyposis syndrome. It is likely that the remainder of the heritable risk for CRC, usually called &quot;familial&quot; or &quot;nonsyndromic familial&quot; CRC, results from one or more genetic polymorphisms with a higher prevalence, but lower penetrance, than genes for Lynch syndrome or FAP. The interaction of these polymorphisms with environmental carcinogens is hypothesized to lead to CRC. After genetic and environmental factors, another important nongenetic risk for CRC is inflammatory bowel disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colorectal cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, and protective factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With the exception of familial cancer syndromes, such as FAP, MAP, and Lynch syndrome, it has been difficult to identify genes that confer risk for familial CRC because multiple genes are involved and interact with the environment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82037\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82037 \">table 1</a>). Families share behaviors and environmental exposures along with their genes, and twin studies suggest that genetic factors account for a small portion of the excess risk in people with a family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The following discussion summarizes how risk can be estimated according to specific information in the family history, what is known about the molecular basis for familial CRC, and approaches to cancer prevention in people with a family history of CRC. Screening and surveillance strategies for patients and family members of patients with known genetic syndromes (Lynch syndrome, FAP, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and familial juvenile polyposis coli) are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-adenomatous-polyposis-screening-and-management-of-patients-and-families\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial adenomatous polyposis: Screening and management of patients and families&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=juvenile-polyposis-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Juvenile polyposis syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-screening-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Screening and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Family history is one of several factors that contribute to the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and should be assessed early in adult life, by age 40 years. Patients with a positive family history should begin CRC screening at a younger age than the usual age of 50 years for average-risk people. This information should be used to decide whether the diagnosis of a hereditary CRC syndrome, such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), should be pursued by aggressive screening <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> genetic testing (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Possibility of Lynch syndrome, FAP, or MAP'</a> below) and whether the patient should begin screening for CRC at an earlier age than average-risk individuals. The assessment should be repeated periodically as the patient ages because cancers may have arisen in family members and the recommended frequency for screening varies with patient risk. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> below.)</p><p>Methods to assess risk include using a decision tool or obtaining a family history of CRC:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An online <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/colorectalcancerrisk/tool.aspx&amp;token=+4cBCd4hrat9fnIyIQ2cmEI0GWyw0tLeDttQ/eVKxjCVXtEiAGZEO3DNZlR7A4TLMKUKljWR3RkgiQY6J15t2Q==&amp;TOPIC_ID=7572\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">decision tool</a> from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), applicable only to non-Hispanic whites, estimates risk for CRC by using data on age, diet, exercise, medication use, and colonoscopy results as well as family history in first-degree relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Prediction models, including the decision tool above from the NCI as well as others, are based on assumptions about the validity of estimates for individual risk and protective factors and their interactions. The model from NCI is the best available predictor of risk for the applicable population, but its accuracy is not known precisely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternatively, clinicians can perform a simple screen for a family history of CRC by asking three questions, keeping in mind that interpretation of the results should take into account the person's age, family size (which, if small, can mask the recognition of a germline mutation as the cause of cancer in a family), and the possibility of uncertain paternity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Have any blood relatives had CRC or a precancerous polyp?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">If so:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>How many, and were these first-degree relatives (parent, sibling, or child) or second-degree relatives (grandparent, cousin, niece, or nephew)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>At what age were the cancers or polyps diagnosed?</p><p/><p>A study from a United States national population-based cancer registry found that 2.1 percent of participants at age 30 years met criteria for more aggressive screening, based upon a family history of CRC, and that 7.1 percent met these high-risk criteria at age 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, changes in family history with relevance to screening evolve over time. The authors of this study recommend that the family history be updated at least every 5 to 10 years.</p><p>Family history is often not elicited or incorporated in patient care. In a survey of patients aged 35 to 55 years enrolled in a multispecialty group practice, 39 percent of patients reported that they had not been asked about family history, 46 percent of patients with a strong family history did not know they should be screened at an earlier age, and 55 percent with a strong family history had not received appropriate screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The cost-effectiveness of taking a family history of CRC to screen for family history has been estimated at $58,000 per year of life gained, similar to that of other widely accepted technologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Size of risk according to family history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The magnitude of increased risk related to a family history depends upon the number of family members affected, whether they are first-degree relatives, and the age of onset in the relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>]. In general, the increase in lifetime risk ranges from about two- to sixfold according to these factors. Estimates of these risks, based on the results of systematic reviews, are shown in a figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59834\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59834 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. One study compared findings at screening colonoscopy of subjects (aged 45 to 75) with a first-degree relative with colon cancer, with screening colonoscopy in average risk controls; the odds ratio for advanced neoplasia in first-degree relatives was 2.41 (95% CI 1.69-3.43) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Another study compared colonoscopy in siblings of patients who had CRC with siblings of people without CRC who had normal colonoscopy studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The prevalence of advanced neoplasm was higher in siblings of CRC patients (7.5 percent versus 2.9 percent, odds ratio [OR] 3.07; 95% CI 1.5-6.3) and prevalence was higher if the index case was female or had a distal CRC.</p><p>The relative effect of family history on risk of CRC decreases as a person ages, however [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and is no longer seen after age 70 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F104863\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104863 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The highest familial risk is in people with multiple first-degree relatives or relatives who have developed CRC at a relatively young age (eg, younger than 50 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Risk for CRC is greater for relatives of patients with colon, as compared with rectal, cancer. CRC occurring in distant relatives, or a single first-degree relative at an older age (eg, &gt;60 years), also are associated with an increased risk. However, the magnitude (relative risk [RR] 1.82, 95% CI 1.47-2.25 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]) is not large enough to change clinical advice or screening practices from those recommended for the general population, and a detailed family history is not indicated if only distant or older relatives are affected.</p><p>Patients' reports of family history may be inaccurate, and family history by itself, without consideration for age of onset, degree of relatedness, or number of affected family members, is not a strong predictor of who will develop CRC, as illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a population-based study in Connecticut in which relatives were sampled for confirmation using registries, Medicare databases, medical records, and death records, the sensitivity of patient report was 27.3 percent and the positive predictive value 53.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cohort study of 431,153 people ages 35 to 80 in the Utah Population Database found that family history was not a strong predictor of who would get CRC in the next 20 years, when viewed as either a relative risk or an absolute risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. For example, 93.3 percent of people in the cohort had a familial relative risk of &lt;1, and less than 0.4 percent of the cohort had a familial relative risk &gt;3.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Family history of colonic polyps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is evidence that patients who have a family member with an adenomatous colonic polyp may also be at increased risk for adenoma or CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. While some guidelines recommend early-onset screening (age 40 years) for people with a family history of polyps in relatives &lt;60 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], guidelines from different organizations vary in terms of age to initiate screening and the frequency of screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] The magnitude of risk may be overestimated because of increased efforts to look for cancer in families who already have a history of colorectal neoplasia. Also, family history for colonic polyps may be inaccurate. In one study, the positive predictive value for self-reported polyp was 80.9 percent, and the negative predictive value was 85.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Systematic reviews of whether having a first-degree relative with colorectal polyps increases the risk of CRC noted that while multiple case-control studies have identified an increased risk of adenomas when family members have an adenoma, evidence is less robust whether a family history of adenoma increases risk for CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/3,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,27</a>]. A systematic review of a meta-analysis and three additional studies found that, compared with persons with no family history of adenomas, the relative risk of CRC in a person with a first-degree relative with an adenoma was 1.99 (95% CI 1.55-2.55) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Because of the potential inaccuracy of the family history, we suggest that patients whose only familial risk factor for CRC is a relative with a history of adenomatous polyp that is not clearly documented as an advanced adenoma (&ge;1 cm, or high-grade dysplasia or villous elements) be screened as an average-risk patient. Individuals who have a first-degree relative with a documented history of advanced adenoma should be screened similarly to those with a family history of CRC. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Age at which familial cancers occur</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In people with a family history, CRCs occur earlier in life, not uncommonly in the 40s or even the 30s (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57102\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57102 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This is the rationale for beginning screening at an earlier age than for people at average risk. If a first-degree relative had CRC before age 60, the family member's risk at age 40 is about the same as an average risk person's at age 50. Relative risk is greatest in the 30s and 40s and by the time people with a family history of CRC reach the 60s, the increase in relative risk has become much smaller. However, the cumulative absolute risk attributable to family history increases with age. For example, the risk of a 70-year-old developing CRC in the next 10 years is about 9 percent if that person has at least two first-degree relatives with CRC, compared with 3 percent in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Possibility of Lynch syndrome, FAP, or MAP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer [HNPCC]) is an autosomal dominant condition associated with a 42 to 52 percent risk of developing CRC in women and a 66 to 69 percent risk in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Although polyps are no more frequent with Lynch syndrome, polyps have an increased tendency to develop into cancer and an increased rate of progression to CRC. Lynch syndrome-related cancers account for 2 to 3 percent of CRCs, occur relatively early in life (commonly in the 30s and 40s and with median age of onset 61 years in mutation-positive relatives (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58291\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58291 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/7,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,31</a>]) and are more likely to occur in the proximal colon.</p><p>Lynch syndrome is recognized by a strong family history of colorectal and other cancers (multiple family members, across generations, developing CRC at a relatively early age) and can be confirmed by genetic testing if tissue (eg, blood or normal tissue) is available from an affected relative. However, it has been found that many people without an obvious family history consistent with Lynch syndrome carry a mutated Lynch syndrome gene and have the syndrome, according to results of universal testing of all patients with CRC for the possibility of Lynch syndrome as recommended by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Although Lynch syndrome is associated predominantly with an increased risk for cancers of the colorectum and endometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], there is also an increased risk of other cancers of the stomach, pancreas, ovary, ureter and renal pelvis, biliary tract, small bowel, thyroid, and brain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>FAP is also a familial cancer, is inherited as an autosomal dominant gene, and accounts for less than 1 percent of CRCs. Hundreds to thousands of polyps occur throughout the colon beginning as early as adolescence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59413\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59413 \">picture 1</a>). Cancers develop beginning in the 20s, and nearly 100 percent of people develop CRC, usually before age 50 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58291\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58291 \">figure 4</a>).

Monoallelic MUTYH mutations are found in 1 to 2 percent of the general population, with biallelic mutations identified in &lt;1 percent of individuals diagnosed with CRC. Individuals with MUTYH-associated polyposis have an estimated lifetime risk of CRC of 70 to 75 percent, and approximately 60 percent of patients have CRC at presentation. By contrast, the risk of CRC in monoallelic MUTYH mutation carriers appears to be only marginally increased with an estimated lifetime risk of 5 to 7 percent.

Rather, it results from the interaction of genetic and environmental causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>The genetic basis for some forms of familial CRC, particularly familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer [HNPCC]) have been well-defined.

Many of these studies were small, patients' genotypes and environmental exposures differed from study to study, and publication bias was detected for most association studies&rsquo; genetic variants, possibly contributing to the variable results (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82037\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82037 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/1,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,34</a>]. More recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found polymorphisms across several chromosomes that have been consistently associated with CRC, although the magnitude of increased risk for each individual polymorphism is small (eg, relative risk [RR] &lt;2) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic association studies: Principles and applications&quot;</a>). The number of identified susceptibility genes is growing as more powerful studies are devised to find them. For example, a meta-analysis of five GWAS with 5626 cases and 7817 controls found seven new CRC risk loci, in addition to the ones already identified, and evidence that other variants of similar effect size might be discovered in the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>More targeted studies of 11 polymorphisms identified by genome wide association studies found that, although most of the 11 were associated with increased risk, taken together they account for only a small proportion of familial aggregation of CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In one study, 10 low-penetrance loci accounted for only 9 percent of the variance in family risk of CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>An attractive hypothesis is that increased risk is associated with polymorphisms that encode enzymes responsible for the metabolic activation of carcinogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. As an example, genetically-determined rapid acetylation by N-acetyltransferase enzymes appears to modify the risk of CRC associated with red meat consumption. A nested case-control study from the Physicians' Health Study found that neither rapid acetylation nor red meat consumption alone was a risk factor for colorectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, in men over age 60, consumption of more than one serving of red meat per day was associated with an increased risk in rapid acetylators (RR 5.82, 95% CI 1.11-30.6) but not in slow acetylators (RR 1.56, CI 0.62-3.93). Similar results were seen in a nested case-control study of women from the Nurses' Health Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>It is generally believed that familial CRC can result from the aggregate effects of many low-penetrance genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The occurrence of multiple polymorphisms in these genes in an individual might confer a substantial increase in that individual's risk. One study developed a risk determination model based on sex, age, family history, a genetic risk score (generated from 27 validated common CRC susceptibility loci) and a history of colonoscopies, using data from six studies (more than 12,000 participants) in the United States and Germany [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The CRC genetic risk score independently predicted which patients would develop CRC. Compared with determination of risk based on family history alone, adding the genetic risk score increased the discriminatory accuracy for men from 0.51 to 0.59; however, the increase for women (from 0.52 to 0.56) did not meet statistical significance. The results were replicated in an independent dataset from another 1800 participants. Pending prospective confirmatory studies, we do not recommend testing for polymorphisms in persons who do not meet clinical criteria for genetic testing to identify familial cancer syndromes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTOR MODIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is prudent to make a special effort to modify behavioral risk factors in people already at increased risk because of family history. As examples, patients should be encouraged to quit smoking, reduce alcohol use, increase fruit and vegetable consumption, decrease red meat consumption, and have regular physical activity. Survey suggests that patient may be receptive to modifying their behavior in response to understanding their risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colorectal cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, and protective factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is some evidence that postmenopausal hormone therapy prevents the development of colorectal neoplasia. The risk for increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) with long-term use of hormone therapy, however, outweighs the small benefit regarding colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is strong evidence that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can decrease risk for colorectal neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. The US Preventive Services Task Force now recommends initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC in adults aged 50 to 59 years who have a 10 percent or greater 10-year CVD risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Careful consideration of the risks and benefits of primary prevention with aspirin must consider the known bleeding risk and potentially beneficial impact on cardiovascular mortality.

Screening recommendations for people with a family history of CRC are based upon extrapolation from evidence of effectiveness in average risk people, modified by knowledge of how the biology of disease differs if a family history is present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for colorectal cancer: Strategies in patients at average risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following general considerations are relevant in developing guidelines for screening people at increased risk:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient is at risk for earlier-onset CRC (eg, first-degree relative with onset of CRC before age 60), screening should begin earlier.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient is at risk for more rapid progression of disease, screening should be performed more frequently.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient is at increased risk (eg, first-degree relative with onset of CRC before age 60), screening should be with colonoscopy rather than other modalities (eg, stool-based tests, flexible sigmoidoscopy, etc). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests for screening for colorectal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>While earlier onset and increased risk are well-documented, there is little direct evidence to bear on whether the rate of progression is actually faster in patients with a family history.</p><p>Screening is begun earlier in people with a family history of early-onset CRC, since their risk at age 40 generally is comparable to an average-risk person's risk at age 50. This is the basis for the general recommendation that screening begin at age 40 instead of 50 if there is a history of early CRC in a first-degree relative. A more specific recommendation is to begin screening 10 years before the age the cancer was diagnosed in the affected relative, to take into account the additional increase in risk related to especially early onset in the family member. These recommendations do not apply to individuals whose family history of early-onset CRC is related to another condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease, where the risk of early CRC is not directly linked to a genetic predisposition.</p><p>There is evidence that screening should be repeated at shorter-than-usual intervals in people with a family history of CRC. In a study evaluating data collected over 22 years from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, screening colonoscopy resulted in a decreased risk of CRC over 10 years for average-risk patients, but the risk returned to baseline at five years for participants with a first-degree relative with CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. For individuals with a negative family history, the hazard ratios of CRC less than or more than five years after colonoscopy were 0.42 (0.35-0.51) and 0.43 (0.32-0.58), respectively. However, for individuals with a positive family history, the hazard ratio for incident CRC within five years of colonoscopy was 0.44 (0.30-0.66) while risk essentially returned to baseline beyond five years (hazard ratio [HR] 0.91 [0.55-1.52]). This supports screening patients with higher-than-average risk every five years.</p><p>One study used a computer simulation model (MISCAN-Colon) to estimate optimal screening strategies for patients with various combinations of number of affected first-degree relatives and age at cancer onset in affected relative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In this study, the optimal strategy was colonoscopy every five years starting from age 50 for individuals with one first-degree relative diagnosed after age 50 years; colonoscopy every four years starting at age 45 for individuals with one first-degree relative diagnosed before age 50 years; every three years starting at age 45 for individuals with two or more first-degree relatives diagnosed after age 50 years; and every three years starting at age 42 for individuals with two or more first-degree relatives of whom at least one was diagnosed before age 50 years.</p><p>Although there is no direct evidence to guide when to end CRC screening among persons with a family history, most guidelines recommend screening continue until age 80. The MISCAN-Colon model suggested that CRC screening should end at age 79 among persons with one first-degree relative diagnosed after age 50, and end at age 85 for persons with two or more first-degree relatives diagnosed before age 40. Also, those whose life expectancy is less than 10 years due to other factors are unlikely to derive appreciable benefit from CRC screening.</p><p>We recommend colonoscopy as the screening modality of choice for persons with a family history. Screening with fecal immunochemical (FIT) stool testing in individuals who have a first-degree relative with CRC was found to have unacceptably low sensitivity in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Among 572 asymptomatic individuals with a positive family history who underwent screening by both colonoscopy and FIT, 24 advanced neoplasms and three CRCs were found in individuals who were FIT-negative, resulting in FIT sensitivities of 35 percent for advanced neoplasm and 25 percent for cancer in this study. In another study of FIT, in which the threshold for a &quot;positive&quot; FIT in a quantitative assay was set intentionally low (&ge;10 microg <span class=\"nowrap\">hemoglobin/g</span> of feces), annual FIT for three years detected all CRC but only 61 percent of advanced adenomas in first-degree relatives of patients with CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3107530000\"><span class=\"h2\">High-risk genetic syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening and prevention of CRC and genetic screening for patients with a personal or family history of high-risk genetic syndromes are discussed in detail elsewhere:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer [HNPCC])</strong> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-screening-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Screening and management&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)</strong> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59413\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59413 \">picture 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-adenomatous-polyposis-screening-and-management-of-patients-and-families\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial adenomatous polyposis: Screening and management of patients and families&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP)</strong> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mutyh-associated-polyposis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;MUTYH-associated polyposis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS)</strong> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=juvenile-polyposis-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Juvenile polyposis syndrome&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>Less frequent hereditary syndromes with increased risk for CRC:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cowden syndrome</strong> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pten-hamartoma-tumor-syndrome-including-cowden-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome, including Cowden syndrome&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Li-Fraumeni syndrome</strong> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=li-fraumeni-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Li-Fraumeni syndrome&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Attenuated FAP (AFAP)</strong> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-adenomatous-polyposis-screening-and-management-of-patients-and-families\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial adenomatous polyposis: Screening and management of patients and families&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peutz-Jeghers syndrome</strong> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peutz-jeghers-syndrome-screening-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peutz-Jeghers syndrome: Screening and management&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Serrated (hyperplastic) polyposis syndrome</strong> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mutyh-associated-polyposis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;MUTYH-associated polyposis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendations of expert groups</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific screening recommendations have been published by several expert groups.

The following questions are reasonable: Have any blood relatives had CRC or an adenoma? If so, how many, and were these first-degree relatives (parent, sibling, or child) or second-degree relatives (grandparent, cousin, niece, or nephew)? Questions should be repeated periodically and interpreted keeping in mind family size (which, if small, can cause false-negative reports) and the possibility of uncertain paternity.

Several polymorphisms have been identified that are statistically associated with CRC, but with the exception of genetic syndromes such as Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer [HNPCC]) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), these associations are weak, inconsistent, and account for little of the observed familial risk.
