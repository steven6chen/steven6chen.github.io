GVHD, which can be acute <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic, occurs when T cells of the donor recognize the presence of histocompatibility antigens in the host that differ from those of the donor cells. This initial antigen recognition is followed by amplification of the T cell recognition process.</p><p>The proliferation of activated T cells leads to the production and secretion of a variety of cytokines, which are responsible for the inflammatory effects and tissue damage associated with GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Much of the damage is caused by inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and gamma-interferon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Use of immunosuppressive agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> (FK506), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> have delineated the critical events that lead to the activation of these alloreactive T cells and the subsequent amplification of the signals involved in T cell proliferation. These laboratory studies have led to an understanding of the mechanisms of action of specific immunosuppressants. Further, such understanding allows for the development and testing of novel immunosuppressive agents.</p><p>This topic review will focus on the most commonly used commercially available immunosuppressive drugs for prevention <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment of GVHD. Discussions of the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of acute and chronic GVHD are found elsewhere in the program. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of chronic graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NON-SPECIFIC IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE DRUGS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Corticosteroids are the most widely used &quot;front-line&quot; therapy for the treatment of clinical GVHD. Drugs of this class have been combined with other immunosuppressants in the prophylaxis against GVHD. However, we still do not fully understand their mechanism of action. This has resulted in empiricism in the development of therapeutic doses and anecdotal reports of efficacy in certain clinical settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H164641633\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanism of action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly utilized corticosteroid is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>, which differs from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> only by the addition of a 6-alpha-methyl group. The 6-alpha-methyl group blocks the specific binding of this corticosteroid to transcortin, the protein that transports steroids in the plasma. Instead, methylprednisolone is primarily bound to albumin. The frequent side effects from methylprednisolone may be dependent on the albumin level in the host.</p><p>The lack of transcortin-binding leads to a larger partition coefficient, resulting in a significantly greater penetration of this agent into bronchial alveolar fluids, which may provide a therapeutic advantage for treatment of pulmonary inflammatory states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The molecular mechanisms by which the corticosteroids exert their effects on the prevention <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment of GVHD are not clearly defined. One report emphasized the potential effect of corticosteroids on the release of cytokines, such as IL-2 and interferon-gamma, thought to be associated with the development of GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>There are data to suggest that the major effect of corticosteroids is the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines rather than direct cellular cytotoxicity against lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In clinical trials that measured cytokines, the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha decreased after the initiation of corticosteroids used for the therapy of GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H164641640\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical use and toxicities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Corticosteroids are given intravenously when used as <strong>prophylaxis</strong> for acute GVHD. The drug of choice has been <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>, followed by oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> when patients are able to eat sufficiently so that one can be confident that they will absorb the medication without difficulty. The doses of methylprednisolone given for prophylaxis have varied, but an example of one such regimen is outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F91020\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91020 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This regimen, which combines <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX), and prednisone (beginning after all MTX doses have been administered), is the most potent combination for the prevention of acute GVHD, resulting in only 9 percent grade II-IV acute GVHD in the best candidates (first remission of acute leukemia or first chronic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia) for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).</p><p>A prospective randomized study comparing the addition of steroids to the standard regimen of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> did not demonstrate an improvement in the prevention of acute GVHD in patients with more advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The usual corticosteroid dose for <strong>treatment</strong> of acute GVHD is 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> administered in divided doses with a very gradual taper. Occasionally, higher pulse doses up to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> have been used. Most regimens taper the steroid dose to zero by +180 days. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are many adverse effects associated with corticosteroids. In addition to their immunosuppressive effects, which set the stage for infectious complications, side effects include Cushingoid features, hyperglycemia, hypertension, occasional psychosis or neurotoxicity, as well as myopathy. Other chronic effects include osteoporosis, cataract formation, and aseptic necrosis of bone. Corticosteroids are sensitive to a variety of drug interactions, specifically anti-convulsants, which may increase the total clearance of unbound corticosteroids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Methotrexate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a> (MTX) is an analog of aminopterin, the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> antagonist introduced in 1948 for the treatment of acute leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As an antimetabolite, it functions as a decoy substrate for critical biochemical reactions involving folic acid, with the ultimate outcome being cell death. The amino group substitution found in MTX results in a less potent antifolate, but a drug with a more predictable toxicity profile and equivalent clinical results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H164641602\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanism of action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the precise mechanism by which MTX prevents GVHD is not understood, it presumably impacts activated T cells, reduces proliferation, and can induce tolerance following marrow transplantation. In canine transplantation, MTX given after grafting was effective in controlling GVHD and in inducing tolerance when donor and recipient were matched for the dog leukocyte antigen system, but when donor and recipient were mismatched, 7 of 10 dogs died of acute GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>MTX was one of the first chemotherapeutic agents introduced for the treatment of malignancies. Studies have detailed its pharmacokinetics and mechanisms of action at the intracellular level. How these mechanisms translate to its in vivo effects and how it functions in the prevention of GVHD, facilitation of engraftment, and induction of tolerance are not well understood.</p><p>At the cellular level, MTX exerts its cytotoxic effect by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), the intracellular enzyme responsible for converting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> to reduced folate co-factors. The reduced state of the folates, namely the tetrahydrofolates, is responsible for the transport of single carbon groups that are required for purine and thymidylate synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Once the single carbon group is delivered, the oxidized folates must be converted back to tetrahydrofolates by DHFR. MTX binds to DHFR, thereby preventing its ability to reduce the oxidized folates to tetrahydrofolate and blocking further purine or thymidylate synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Mechanism of action'</a>.)</p><p>Polyglutamate formation is also important to MTX metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The intracellular formation of MTX polyglutamates is through the action of the enzyme folyl polyglutamate synthetase. These polyglutamate moieties appear to be as toxic to the enzyme DHFR as the native compound and are retained inside the cell, which leads to prolonged antifolate activity. Differences in intracellular concentrations within lymphocytes, as compared to other cell populations, may account for selective toxicities and may selectively inhibit certain subpopulations of cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H164641609\"><span class=\"h3\">Toxicities and clinical use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common adverse effects of MTX when used for GVHD prophylaxis are renal, hepatic, and gastrointestinal toxicity. Commonly, patients may have an elevation in creatinine and bilirubin levels following the administration of MTX. As these are also the side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, dose attenuation of MTX and cyclosporine or tacrolimus may be necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatotoxicity associated with chronic low-dose methotrexate for nonmalignant disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-induced-lung-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methotrexate-induced lung injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate#H59543899\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of low-dose methotrexate&quot;, section on 'Common toxicities'</a>.)</p><p>Full target doses of MTX may not be achievable in patients who already have grade III-IV mucositis resulting from the preparatory regimen, as well as from previous doses of MTX.</p><p>The use of MTX following allogeneic HCT has been exclusively via the intravenous formulation. The drug doses administered have been relatively small, given the inability to dose escalate MTX significantly. MTX generally is administered IV on days +1, +3, +6 and +11 following HCT. Initial studies in Seattle tested MTX on a weekly basis up to day +100 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Because of the toxicity of weekly administration of MTX, the dose was changed to four doses and combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This schema is the most commonly utilized regimen today. Patients should be very well hydrated, and have their urine alkalinized with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>; MTX should not be administered until the urine pH is &ge;8.0. Patients should be assessed for the presence of ascites, pleural effusion, or any other fluid collection similar to any other patient receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>. If there is a known fluid collection, patients should not receive methotrexate and a different immune suppressant could be used. Patients with known fluid collection and who receive methotrexate are at risk of developing complications, including acute renal failure. The prevention and management of methotrexate toxicity is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic use and toxicity of high-dose methotrexate&quot;, section on 'Prevention and management of HDMTX toxicity'</a>.)</p><p>Dose attenuation should be considered for elevations of creatinine or bilirubin or the presence of grade III-IV mucositis. There has been one report of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> rescue after MTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In this small series, use of leucovorin was not associated with an adverse outcome. Leucovorin circumvents the blocked tetrahydrofolate synthesis by supplying reduced folates directly, therefore bypassing the metabolic block.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC T CELL IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE DRUGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> are immunosuppressive drugs that act on T lymphocytes.

Cyclosporine was extracted in 1969 from two strains of fungi isolated from soil samples; it demonstrated only limited effects as an antifungal agent, but was highly effective as an immunosuppressive agent. These studies led to its being administered to patients in 1978 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> is a neutral hydrophobic cyclic peptide composed of 11 amino acids. Over the past decade, much work has been devoted to understanding its mechanism of action. Moreover, cyclosporine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> have been used as chemical probes to dissect the pathways of T cell activation. This understanding may lead to the generation of novel immunosuppressants, which may be more specific and potentially less toxic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of cyclosporine and tacrolimus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H152830127\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanism of action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> are distinct in their molecular structure, their mechanism of action will be discussed together, since they are almost indistinguishable in their cellular functions. What is known thus far is that both agents block the calcium dependent signal transduction pathways distal to engagement of the T cell receptor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60611\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60611 \">figure 1</a>). This block interrupts the activation of T cells, since the signaling from the T cell receptor is prevented. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Tacrolimus'</a> below.)</p><p>In dissecting the signaling pathway, several critical intracellular molecules have been identified and include: calmodulin, calcineurin and the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT). The activation cascade includes calcium binding to calmodulin, which leads to binding calcineurin. The activated calcineurin may dephosphorylate the cytoplasmic unit of NF-AT which allows translocation of the NF-AT from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to form a competent transcriptional activator of the IL-2 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The cytosolic binding protein for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> was isolated in 1984 from lymphocytes and named cyclophilin for its high affinity for cyclosporine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The analogous major isoform for the binding protein for FK506 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>) has been termed FK binding protein (FKBP). Both cyclophilin and FKBP are highly basic and very abundant in the cytoplasm. Although these two proteins do not have sequence homology, they both function as the enzyme prolyl cis-trans isomerase (or rotamase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Rotamase accelerates the conversion of cis- and trans-rotamers of proline-containing peptides or proteins. This conversion step is thought to be the rate-limiting step during normal protein folding.</p><p>Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> are potent inhibitors of rotamase activity. Their binding to these rotamases suggests that inhibition of this enzyme may be an important step leading to immunosuppression. The complex of drug and binding protein interrupts the activation cascade at the level of NF-AT dephosphorylation, and therefore, NF-AT is not able to enter the nuclear domain and activate IL-2.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H152830134\"><span class=\"h3\">Toxicities and clinical use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> is a highly lipophilic drug which is extensively metabolized with subsequent biliary, and to a lesser extent, urinary secretion. Over 15 metabolites have been isolated and identified. Some metabolites have immunosuppressive activity while others are nephrotoxic. Thus, the clinical efficacy and interactions between cyclosporine and other drugs may be confounded by its metabolites. However, the most commonly reported inhibition or induction of cyclosporine metabolism is by cytochrome p450 enzymes, specifically, HLp and PCN1 enzymes that are members of the cytochrome P450 IIIA gene family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This interaction is important to keep in mind especially when patients are treated with antifungal medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>, which may significantly increase cyclosporine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> levels. It is important to adjust the dose of cyclosporine or tacrolimus downward to avoid drug toxicity. </p><p>The major clinical toxicities that need to be monitored with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> administration are renal insufficiency and elevation of bilirubin levels. Both complications appear to be dose-related [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The acute nephrotoxicity is due to vasoconstriction and ischemia of the afferent arterioles in the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These acute changes are reversible but if continued for too long can lead to an irreversible interstitial injury with glomerular thrombosis, resulting in permanent azotemia. A major difficulty clinically is to differentiate specific side effects of the cyclosporine from those of other drugs, such as amphotericin, MTX, aminoglycoside, or from an underlying disease process, such as GVHD itself. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of cyclosporine and tacrolimus&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a>.)</p><p>Other side effects that are commonly encountered are hypertension, hyperglycemia, headaches, and hirsutism. Rarer events that have been described include gum hypertrophy, brittle nails, acne, nausea and vomiting. One specific clinical concern is neurotoxicity associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, which can be more prominent with hypomagnesemia and hypocholesterolemia. Potential mechanisms include vascular damage based on cyclosporine's effect on endothelial cell synthesis of prostaglandin, and release and uptake of endothelin. Reported adverse events involved all levels of the neuraxis including cortical blindness. Associated abnormalities include elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein and pleocytosis, various electroencephalographic abnormalities, and characteristic neuroimaging findings (central and extrapontine myelinolysis). In most patients these events were reversible with dosage reduction or withdrawal of therapy.</p><p>Hypertension alone can occasionally become a significant problem. Calcium channel blockers are the drugs of choice for such hypertension, since they are effective in this setting. However, their use may be associated with changes in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> levels (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>), which may require cyclosporine dosing change. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertension-after-renal-transplantation#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertension after renal transplantation&quot;, section on 'Calcium channel blockers'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of cyclosporine and tacrolimus&quot;, section on 'Food and drug interactions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of cyclosporine and tacrolimus&quot;, section on 'Hypertension'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> can be administered either intravenously or orally. It is initially administered intravenously, since in the early phase following transplantation many patients develop mucositis and GI damage from the preparatory transplantation regimen, as well as from MTX given for GVHD prophylaxis. Once the patient is eating and drinking without significant difficulties, cyclosporine may be switched to an oral preparation.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> is available in solution, as well as in soft gelatin capsules. It is erratically and incompletely absorbed after oral administration, with many factors reported to influence oral cyclosporine bioavailability. For example, food intake may have an impact in its absorption, especially if the meal is high in fat content. Absorption kinetics of cyclosporine has been described as either zero order or a series of first order processes. Cyclosporine dosage usually is governed by research protocols, beginning the drug at a higher dose as a &quot;loading dose&quot;, with a gradual taper over time. However there are several variations of dosing schedules. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of cyclosporine and tacrolimus&quot;, section on 'Absorption'</a>.)</p><p>There have been several studies attempting to correlate the efficacy of prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> with its level in whole blood, plasma, or serum. The only assay that is completely specific for the parent compound is high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). All the other assays including polyclonal, monoclonal antibodies, and immunoassays, measure varying amounts of cyclosporine metabolites. Therefore, the target level that one uses will vary, depending on which assay the diagnostic laboratory utilizes for measuring cyclosporine levels. While the specific analytic methods are clearly more precise and preferable to the non-specific methods for therapeutic drug monitoring, the technical difficulties in current HPLC methods make it less practical to utilize HPLC widely.</p><p>Moreover, there are limited data to suggest that there is a correlation between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> levels and clinical outcome. Results from these studies suggest that there may be a complex relationship between dose, blood level, and occurrence of GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. These studies failed to demonstrate a clear direct correlation between drug level and occurrence of GVHD, and confirmed the intricate interactions and balance of the immune responses in the host.</p><p>From a practical standpoint, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> is administered to achieve a therapeutic level, but beyond that, it is important to deliver the planned dose as per protocol. It is also important to be certain that the level drawn is a trough level and is obtained under steady state conditions, otherwise the values will not be interpretable. Cyclosporine levels are used to increase the dose if they are below the therapeutic threshold, but the dose is not decreased for elevated levels if no toxicity is present. However, if the level is above two times the upper limit of the therapeutic range, then it is reasonable to decrease the dose to avoid potential neurotoxicity (ie, seizures). Therefore, there is a range where cyclosporine levels do not result in any change in clinical management. There are also concerns about the possible interactions between cyclosporine and other medications. Many different drugs have been implicated in increasing or decreasing cyclosporine levels in patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Tacrolimus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tacrolimus</a> (FK506) is a macrolide antibiotic extracted from the soil fungus streptomyces tsukubaensis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Its mechanism of action has been reviewed in the section immediately above describing cyclosporine. It is generally given intravenously in the early phases following allogeneic transplantation and then switched to the oral formulation. There is rapid distribution of the drug to the extracellular space after a short intravenous infusion. (See <a href=\"#H152830127\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of action'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H165959732\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical use and toxicities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following oral administration, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> is erratically and incompletely absorbed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. The major difference from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> is that the absorption of tacrolimus does not seem to depend on the presence of bile salts. tacrolimus undergoes extensive distribution, with the highest levels found in the lung, kidney, heart, and spleen, while in the blood, it is distributed into red blood cells. Less than 1 percent of the intravenous or oral dose appears unchanged in the urine, indicating that the drug is almost completely metabolized in the liver prior to its elimination. It is metabolized primarily through monodemethylation, demethylation, and hydroxylation. The half-life of tacrolimus is approximately nine hours, and is longer in those patients who have hepatic dysfunction. Tacrolimus is monitored in a similar fashion to cyclosporine. Appropriate doses and levels of tacrolimus have not yet been well defined in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tacrolimus</a> is moderately well tolerated in humans. Most of the data on adverse events can be categorized as neurotoxicity, renal toxicity, and hyperglycemia and generally have been reported in solid organ transplantation recipients. Tacrolimus can cause an increase in serum creatinine concentration similar to that of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, probably secondary to decrease in glomerular filtration. Hypertension in previously normotensive patients has also been described. Occasionally hypertension can be quite refractory to antihypertensive medication. The most commonly utilized anti-hypertensives, as with cyclosporine, have included the calcium channel blockers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of cyclosporine and tacrolimus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Central nervous system (CNS) effects have also been found, including headaches, tremors, paresthesias, photophobia, mental status changes, and coma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Hyperkalemia has also been observed following tacrolimus administration. The use of both cyclosporine and tacrolimus has been associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Similar to tacrolimus, sirolimus has two domains, a domain bound by FKBP and an effector domain forming a composite surface that interacts with the mammalian target of sirolimus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Sirolimus inhibits the growth of hematopoietic and lymphoid cells in vitro. The most striking observation is that it suppresses cytokine-driven growth of these cells. The data demonstrate a significant increase in the proportion of G1 phase cells when sirolimus is added [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The mechanism of action of sirolimus is to inhibit specifically the progression of cells from G1 into the S phase, suggesting that it may interfere with the signaling that is critical for the cyclin-cdk complex required for cellular proliferation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60611\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60611 \">figure 1</a>). Data using human peripheral blood T cells demonstrate that the block of G1 may be related to an increase in a species of titratable inhibitor of G1 cyclin-cdk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>In addition to regulation of the cell cycle, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> may also exert an effect on signal transduction pathways which mediate specific cytokine responses. For example, sirolimus has been shown to inhibit IL-1 driven gamma-interferon production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Moreover, the secondary signals required for T cell activation and proliferation are dependent on ligation of the B7 family with CD28. Lack of the secondary signal has been shown to result in anergy in the responding T cell. While the signaling through the T cell receptor is not affected by sirolimus, the signaling through CD28 is inhibited by sirolimus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

Other problems include hypertriglyceridemia, a decrease in platelets and leukocytes, epistaxis, blood pressure changes, headaches, nausea, mucous membrane irritation, and infections. Adverse reactions previously observed with other macrolide antibiotics are also of concern. Testicular atrophy has been observed in both mice and non-human primates. These early observations suggest that liver function abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia may be its dose limiting toxicity.</p><p>A pilot trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> as second-line therapy was conducted in 21 patients who had failed treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> for acute GVHD following allogeneic HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Cells have two pathways to produce purines, a de novo and a salvage pathway. Lymphocytes are highly dependent on de novo synthesis, while other cells can utilize both pathways. The therapeutic index of MMF depends on the lymphocyte's reliance on de novo synthesis of purines, allowing for greater immunosuppressive activity with less toxicity.</p><p>In the de novo pathway, the ribose phosphate portion of the purine nucleotide is derived from 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate. This 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate is formed from adenosine triphosphate and the sugar ribose-5-phosphate. Therefore, 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate is an essential intermediary in the synthesis of purines. Following lymphocyte stimulation, there is a brisk and sustained increase in 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate and guanosines and deoxyguanosines, which activate 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate synthetase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Depletion of guanosines would lead to a decrease in 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate synthetase and inhibition of the purine synthesis which is required for T cell activation. MPA's action is through the inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). This enzyme catalyzes oxidation of inosine monophosphate to xanthine monophosphate, a required intermediate in the synthesis of guanosine triphosphate. The enzyme IMPDH is a critical enzyme for the de novo biosynthesis of purine nucleotides, specifically guanosine monophosphate (GMP).

One product uses thymocytes injected into horses, while a second uses rabbits. A third product uses Jurkat cells (a T cell line) as the antigen.

Since the antigens employed are quite varied, the list of antibodies against all the antigens present on thymocytes is quite broad and the immune effects can be extensive.</p><p>For the horse antibody the process of generating this product is inconsistent (ie, different horses, different pooled lymphocytes, different dominant responses). Accordingly, it is difficult to determine pharmacokinetics and efficacy, because of significant lot-to-lot and animal-to-animal variabilities. The rabbit product appears to suffer less from lot-to-lot variations. While the measurable half-life of the antibody is approximately nine hours, the functional half-life is not known.</p><p>ATG has been used as part of the preparatory regimen prior to infusion of the donor cells to decrease the incidence of graft rejection, or following HCT to prevent or ameliorate GVHD.
