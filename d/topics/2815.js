Its psychoactive properties are primarily due to one cannabinoid: delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); THC concentration is commonly used as a measure of cannabis potency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The legal status of cannabis use, for medical as well as recreational purposes, varies internationally as well as across the United States. The potency of cannabis has increased significantly around the world in recent decades, which may have contributed to increased rates of cannabis-related adverse effects. Cannabis use disorder develops in approximately 10 percent of regular cannabis users, and may be associated with cognitive impairment, poor school or work performance and psychiatric comorbidity such as mood disorders and psychosis. </p><p>The pathogenesis and pharmacology of cannabis use and cannabis use disorder in adults are reviewed here, as are synthetic cannabinoids. The medico-legal context, epidemiology, comorbidity, and health consequences of cannabis use and cannabis use disorder in adults are discussed separately as are the clinical manifestations, course, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of cannabis use disorder. Acute cannabis intoxication is also reviewed separately.

Its psychoactive properties are primarily due to one cannabinoid: delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); THC concentration is commonly used as a measure of cannabis potency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The THC content of cannabis seized by law enforcement has increased significantly around the world since the late 1960s, from approximately 1 to 5 percent to as much as 15 percent, along with a decrease in cannabidiol (CBD, a phytocannabinoid without psychoactive effects, so little or no abuse liability) content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. This increase in THC concentration and THC:CBD ratio may contribute to increased rates of cannabis-related adverse effects.</p><p>Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) binds to and is a partial agonist at two types of endogenous G-protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors: CB1 and CB2. CB1 receptors are distributed throughout the brain and elsewhere in the body, including vascular endothelium, liver, and adipose tissue. CB2 receptors are present on immune cells throughout the body (including brain microglia) and on some neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>THC activates CB1 receptors in the dopaminergic mesolimbic brain circuit, resulting in enhanced release of presynaptic dopamine. Such activation of the so-called &ldquo;brain reward system&rdquo; is hypothesized to mediate the positive reinforcing and rewarding effects of almost all drugs of abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Chronic regular (more than weekly) cannabis use downregulates brain CB1 receptors; abstinence results in receptor upregulation within several days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These receptor changes are associated with an often uncomfortable or distressing cannabis withdrawal syndrome, recognized in DSM-5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], which may serve as negative reinforcement to continue cannabis use in order to suppress the withdrawal.

A 2010 meta-analysis of 28 published twin studies found that the proportion of variance in who initiates cannabis use due to genetic factors was 48 and 40 percent in men and women, respectively, due to shared environment 25 and 39 percent, and due to unshared environment 27 and 21 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The corresponding contributions for who develops cannabis use disorder were 51 and 59 percent for genetic factors, 20 and 15 percent for shared environment, and 29 and 26 percent for unshared environment. The genetic contribution may be greater in adolescent than in older cannabis users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and may influence all psychoactive drug use, not just specifically cannabis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Several individual candidate genes have been proposed for cannabis use disorder, but there is no convincing evidence for any single gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Three genome-wide association studies found no significant genetic associations with cannabis dependence (DSM-IV criteria), initiation of cannabis use, or age of onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A 2016 larger (14,754 participants) genome-wide association study found significant associations between cannabis dependence (DSM-IV criteria) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms in several genes related to neuronal calcium homeostasis or central nervous system development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2937395984\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic studies show that at least half the risk for initiating cannabis use or developing cannabis use disorder comes from environmental factors (see <a href=\"#H711310696\" class=\"local\">'Genetic basis'</a> above). </p><p>Observational studies (both cross-sectional and longitudinal) suggest several risk factors associated with cannabis use and cannabis use disorder, but cannot prove direct causation. These risk factors include family dysfunction (eg, parental conflict, parental divorce), stressful life events (eg, childhood physical or sexual abuse, poor school performance, involvement with the criminal justice system), and use of cannabis or other psychoactive substances within the social network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Protective factors associated with decreased probability of cannabis use and cannabis use disorder include a supportive family environment, strong religious involvement, good school performance, and absence of substance use within the social network.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3042156629\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H711927934\"><span class=\"h2\">Types</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <em>cannabis</em> plant has three species or major varieties. <em>C. sativa</em> and <em>C. indica</em> contain significant amounts of psychoactive phytocannabinoids (eg, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]), so are cultivated for recreational and medicinal use. <em>C. ruderalis</em> contains negligible amounts of psychoactive compounds, is cultivated for seeds and fiber (hemp), and is not considered an illegal substance. Psychoactive phytocannabinoids are generally found only in the female plant, although in some varieties the male plant may contain significant amounts. THC is found chiefly in the flowering heads (&ldquo;buds&rdquo;), with much less in the leaves and stems. Significant products include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannabis (marijuana) usually refers to an unsorted mixture of dried flowers, leaves, and stems (typical THC content around 6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinsemilla refers to the unpollinated female plant (THC content around 13 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hashish refers to the compressed resinous secretion of the plant (around 40 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hash oil refers to the oil derived from the resin (around 50 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannabis concentrates containing up to 80 percent THC (&ldquo;dabs,&rdquo; &ldquo;earwax&rdquo;) are produced by solvent-based extraction (often butane) of THC from plant material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This results in a dense oil or wax-like substance that can be readily vaporized in a table-top vaporizer or &ldquo;e-cigarette&rdquo; (so-called &ldquo;electronic drug delivery devices&rdquo;) or by placing a dab at the tip of a glass or metal rod that is heated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196437457\"><span class=\"h2\">Routes of consumption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cannabis is most commonly consumed via smoked, inhaled vapor, and oral routes of administration. Transdermal (patch or gel) cannabis formulations are marketed in some states, but there is no scientific evidence that these achieve pharmacologically active levels of cannabinoids in the body. Vaporizing cannabis (&ldquo;vaping&rdquo;) heats the material without burning (pyrolysis). This minimizes inhalation of hot gases and potential carcinogens compared with smoking and may produce less respiratory irritation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Sublingual administration is used for some medical cannabis preparations (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nabiximols-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nabiximols</a>). Intravenous and rectal suppository administration have been reported in the literature, but appear to be extremely rare.</p><p>Route of administration substantially influences the pharmacokinetics of cannabinoids. Smoked and vaporized cannabis have rapid absorption, with THC detectable in plasma within seconds and peak concentrations in 3 to 10 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This results in rapid onset of action (within one minute) and intense subjective effects. The rapid onset and precise control over delivered dose allow for partial titration of dosing despite variations in potency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Oral cannabis has slower absorption, with peak plasma THC concentrations one to four hours after ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], resulting in delayed and less intense effects. This may translate into less abuse liability, based on clinical experience with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronabinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronabinol</a> (synthetic THC). Naive users, experiencing no immediate effect from their initial oral dose, may take additional doses within a short period of time, resulting in inadvertent overdose as the cumulative dose is absorbed.</p><p>Passive (secondhand) exposure to cannabis smoke rarely produces a positive drug test and does not cause subjective effects or impairment under normal conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367495906\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacokinetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic bioavailability of smoked THC is typically 15 to 30 percent, with substantial individual variability, in part due to variations in inhalation technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/21,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,26</a>]. Oral bioavailability is lower (typically 5 to 10 percent) due to extensive first pass metabolism in the liver, and also has substantial individual variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>The initial apparent volume of distribution of THC is relatively small (2 to 6 L) due to extensive protein binding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The steady-state volume of distribution is an order of magnitude greater (70 to 200 L), due to rapid redistribution of THC, which is highly lipophilic, from blood into fatty tissue throughout the body, including brain and adipose tissue. Regular cannabis use results in accumulation of THC in adipose tissue, from which it is slowly released whenever blood concentrations are low. Thus, body stores of THC may be high while blood concentrations are low, and detectable blood and urine concentrations may occur weeks after last cannabis use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This complicated pharmacokinetic profile (plus the existence of active metabolites) makes it difficult to find significant correlations between peripheral THC concentrations and psychological effects or psychomotor impairment, except in the acute situation soon after ingestion. As an example, a study of 602 individuals arrested for impaired driving whose blood toxicology testing detected only THC present found that blood THC concentration accounted for no more than 3 percent of the variance in performance on two standard road-side psychomotor tests (finger-to-nose, eye convergence) and did not correlate with several others (walk-and-turn, one-leg stand, tremors, pupil reaction to light) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. No single blood THC concentration distinguished those with versus without impairment.</p><p>THC is metabolized primarily by the hepatic cytochrome P-450 isozymes 3A4 and 2C9 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Its predominant metabolite is 11-OH-THC (20 percent of smoked THC, 100 percent of oral), which is then further oxidized to THC-COOH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/21,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,26</a>]. OH-11-THC is pharmacologically active and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, while THC-COOH has no subjective effects. THC and its major metabolites are largely excreted in urine (20 to 35 percent) and feces (65 to 80 percent), which may test positive for several weeks after last cannabis intake. Less than 5 percent of a THC dose appears unchanged in the urine.</p><p>Cannabidiol has a systemic bioavailability (range 11 to 45 percent) similar to THC when smoked, and a much lower oral bioavailability (approximately 5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/21,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,26</a>]. Cannabidiol is metabolized primarily by the hepatic cytochrome P-450 isozymes 3A4 and 2C19 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], with an elimination half-life after chronic oral dosing of two to five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/21,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,26</a>].

They include illicit, abused substances reviewed here, as well as medications that can be legally prescribed, reviewed separately. The clinical presentation and management of acute intoxication from synthetic cannabinoids are also reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synthetic cannabinoids: Acute intoxication&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cannabis-use-and-disorder-epidemiology-comorbidity-health-consequences-and-medico-legal-status#H1638992541\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cannabis use and disorder: Epidemiology, comorbidity, health consequences, and medico-legal status&quot;, section on 'Medico-legal context'</a>.)</p><p>Illicitly made synthetic cannabinoids are now a growing health problem around the world, having first appeared in Europe in the late 2000s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The compounds are sprayed on non-cannabis plant material and marketed at convenience stores or over the Internet for legal uses (eg, incense, air freshener) under innocuous brand names (eg, &ldquo;Spice,&rdquo; &ldquo;K2&rdquo;). As these compounds do not have the delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) chemical structure, they are not detected by standard drug screening tests, hence they are often termed &ldquo;legal highs&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. New assays that identify specific synthetic cannabinoids are being developed but are expensive and thus not widely available. Compounds with slightly different chemical structure are constantly developed and marketed to evade detection. More than 200 were isolated and identified as of 2016.</p><p>Little is known about the epidemiology of synthetic cannabinoid use. A 2015 secondary analysis of United States national survey data found that 0.045 percent of 12- to 34-year-olds reported lifetime use of synthetic cannabinoids, representing 3.6 percent those reporting use of any &ldquo;new or uncommon&rdquo; synthetic psychoactive drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The prevalence may be higher than in the 2009 to 2013 sample; there was increasing prevalence of synthetic cannabinoid use over time within the subsample, from 0 percent in 2009 to 39.7 percent in 2013. Synthetic cannabinoid users were predominantly unmarried white men living in urban areas; more than 80 percent also used plant-derived cannabis, alcohol, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tobacco.</p><p>Synthetic cannabinoids first came to clinical attention because of patients with acute cannabis-like effects who screened negative for THC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Many of the adverse effects of synthetic cannabinoids are more intense or longer lasting (sometimes days) versions of acute effects of cannabis, eg, tachycardia, agitation, sedation, and psychosis, sometimes requiring hospitalization. Other effects are not commonly associated with cannabis use, such as hypertension, QTc-interval prolongation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], vomiting, delirium, catatonia, seizures, and kidney failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/29,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,32</a>]. </p><p>Approximately two dozen deaths associated with synthetic cannabinoid use have been reported in the United States through May 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], whereas there are no well-documented reports of adult deaths associated with cannabis ingestion absent concomitant ingestion of other central nervous system depressants. Regular use of synthetic cannabinoids is associated with a more severe withdrawal syndrome than that associated with cannabis withdrawal. Individuals with synthetic cannabinoid withdrawal may require inpatient hospitalization because of seizures or cardiovascular and respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-pathogenesis-and-pharmacology/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Prolonged release from these stores as blood concentrations decline results in poor correlation between THC blood concentration and THC effects. THC is metabolized primarily by hepatic cytochrome P450 into both active and inactive metabolites, which may be present in urine for several weeks after the last cannabis intake. (See <a href=\"#H367495906\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacokinetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Synthetic cannabinoids have cannabinoid-like actions but not necessarily a cannabinoid chemical structure. Their acute effects can be more intense and long-lasting than those of cannabis, in part because they are pure agonists with high affinity at the cannabinoid 1 receptor, whereas THC is a partial agonist at both the cannabinoid 1 and 2 receptors. This can result in acute intoxication and withdrawal syndromes that are medically serious and require hospitalization.
