Because of trends towards earlier pubertal development, some healthy girls will have breast or pubic hair development before this age, and extensive evaluation and treatment may not be required. If the evaluation leads to a diagnosis of progressive precocious puberty, treatment may be considered.</p><p>The treatment of precocious puberty, which depends upon the underlying cause, will be discussed in this topic. The definition, etiology, and evaluation of precocious puberty are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and evaluation of precocious puberty&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23808232\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Precocious puberty can be classified based upon the underlying pathologic process. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Central</strong> <strong>precocious puberty</strong> &mdash; Central precocious puberty (CPP, also known as gonadotropin-dependent precocious puberty or true precocious puberty) is caused by early maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. It is characterized by sequential maturation of breasts and pubic hair in girls, and of maturation of the testes, penis, and pubic hair in boys. The sexual characteristics are appropriate for the child's gender (isosexual). CPP is idiopathic in 80 to 90 percent of cases in girls, whereas intracranial lesions are detected in 40 to 75 percent of boys with CPP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52565\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52565 \">table 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and evaluation of precocious puberty&quot;, section on 'Causes of central precocious puberty (CPP)'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peripheral precocity</strong> &mdash; Peripheral precocity (also known as gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty or peripheral precocious puberty) is caused by excess secretion of sex hormones (estrogens or androgens) derived either from the gonads or adrenal glands, exogenous sources of sex steroids, or ectopic production of gonadotropins from a germ cell tumor (eg, human chorionic gonadotropin, hCG) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59268 \">table 1B</a>). We use the term precocity instead of puberty because puberty implies activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, as occurs in CPP, whereas precocity refers only to the secondary sexual characteristics. Peripheral precocity is most commonly either isosexual (concordant with the child's gender), or contrasexual (with virilization of girls and feminization of boys), but can also present with both virilizing and feminizing features in rare cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and evaluation of precocious puberty&quot;, section on 'Causes of peripheral precocity'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Benign or non-progressive pubertal variants</strong> &mdash; Benign pubertal variants include isolated breast development in girls (premature thelarche) or isolated androgen-mediated sexual characteristics (such as pubic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> axillary hair, acne, and apocrine odor) in boys or girls that result from early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (premature adrenarche) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72054\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72054 \">table 1C</a>). Both of these conditions can be a variant of normal puberty. However, repeat evaluations may be warranted in these children to be certain that the diagnosis is correct. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and evaluation of precocious puberty&quot;, section on 'Types of benign or non-progressive pubertal variants'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23808992\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT FOR CPP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When warranted, pubertal progression in central precocious puberty (CPP) can be treated by administration of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist. GnRH agonists work by providing continuous stimulation to the pituitary gonadotrophs, instead of physiologic pulsatile secretion of hypothalamic GnRH. Continuous stimulation leads to desensitization of the gonadotroph cells and suppression of gonadotropins, resulting in decreased sex steroid production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], a phenomenon referred to as pituitary-gonadal axis suppression. This treatment can be used for patients with idiopathic or neurogenic CPP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], or for secondary activation of CPP, which may occur in patients who initially present with peripheral precocity. However, not all patients require treatment, as outlined in the following section. </p><p>When CPP is caused by an identifiable central nervous system (CNS) lesion, therapy is also directed toward the underlying pathology when possible. Benign hypothalamic hamartomas are often left in situ and monitored neuroradiologically over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], unless associated with significant generalized epileptic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23809000\"><span class=\"h2\">Decision to treat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision of whether to treat CPP with a GnRH agonist depends upon the child's age, the rate of pubertal progression (sexual maturation), height velocity, and the estimated adult height as determined from the rate of bone age advancement. Pubertal progression would be considered slow if there is no change in stage of breast, pubic hair, or genital development during six or more months of observation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72017\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72017 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Height velocity is considered accelerated if it is more than 6 cm per year. The relationship between pubertal stages and height velocity in normally developing children is outlined in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52047%7EPEDS%2F72046\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52047 graphicRef72046 \">figure 1A-B</a>) and discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;, section on 'Pubertal changes'</a>.) </p><p>Clinical decision-making related to height preservation is guided by the following considerations (decision-making related to psychosocial concerns is described below (see <a href=\"#H18658176\" class=\"local\">'Goals of treatment'</a> below)):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Age</strong> &mdash; Children with CPP who present at a younger age and have a rapid progression of maturation benefit the most from therapy because they have early epiphyseal fusion and reduced adult height if they are not treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In contrast, children who present close to the age of normal puberty or who have a very slowly progressive variant of precocious puberty usually do not require any therapy because their adult height without treatment is concordant with their midparental height range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For girls with onset of CPP before the age of six years, GnRH agonist treatment results in an average gain in adult height of 9 to 10 cm, whereas, for those with onset of CPP between six and eight years, treatment results in an average gain in adult height of 4 to 7 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/7,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12,13</a>]. The degree of bone age advancement prior to treatment initiation can, however, attenuate this height gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For boys, fewer data are available. One study estimated that GnRH treatment beginning at an average age of 7.6 years resulted in a mean height gain of 6.2 &plusmn; 8.7 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. An expert panel concluded that it is reasonable to consider GnRH agonist treatment for boys with progressive CPP if they present before nine years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As in girls, GnRH agonist therapy may result in less height gain for boys with a more advanced bone age at the initiation of therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rate of maturation</strong> <strong>(pubertal progression)</strong> &mdash; If precocious puberty is slowly progressive, it is unlikely to compromise adult height and in that instance we do not suggest therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a study of 16 such girls who were followed for 12 years without treatment, all reached normal adult height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Despite the early onset of breast development in this group, menarche occurred at a normal age (average age 11 years). Similarly, in a group of 35 boys with slowly progressive puberty (defined as progression from sexual maturity rating [Tanner] stage 2 to 3 over more than 18 months) who were not treated, adult height was within the range of their target height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Clinical experience has shown that many cases of precocious puberty, particularly in girls with onset after six years of age, will be slowly progressive. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Estimated adult height</strong> &mdash; If the estimated adult height is above 150 cm in girls and above 160 cm in boys, therapy is probably not needed to achieve normal adult height, and a conservative approach is therefore warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A variety of methods can be used to predict adult height. A common method developed by Bayley and Pinneau employs a table to predict adult height based upon the child's bone age and chronological age. Height prediction methods have, however, often been found to over-predict the adult height in children with precocious puberty. </p><p/><p>Based upon the data described above, we suggest GnRH agonist therapy for a girl presenting with CPP before the age of six with breast and pubic hair development, advanced bone age, and accelerated height velocity. Conversely, in a girl with somewhat later onset of CPP <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> historically slow progression of pubertal development without a substantial increase in height velocity, we suggest monitoring without treatment for three to six months to establish the pace of the pubertal progression before making treatment decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. For boys, we treat all those presenting with CPP before the age of nine years, unless there is evidence of slow pubertal progression, in which case we monitor clinically to assess the pace of pubertal progression before making treatment decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18658176\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals of treatment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A primary goal of treatment for CPP is to allow a child to grow to a normal adult height. Therefore, as noted above, the decision to treat should include analysis of the predicted height benefit from treatment. (See <a href=\"#H23809000\" class=\"local\">'Decision to treat'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another goal of therapy is to relieve psychosocial stress. Parents are often concerned about the prospect of early menses, which might be distressing to a young girl. However, the data regarding the psychosocial impact of CPP are limited. A study of 19 girls with CPP prior to treatment initiation found no difference in psychological distress as compared with girls with normal puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A study of 10 girls with CPP demonstrated reduced stress levels following one year of GnRHa therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, another study of 36 girls with CPP demonstrated improvement in psychological scores irrespective of GnRHa treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Because of scant data in this area, treatment primarily to address perceived psychosocial consequences of precocious puberty should be approached with caution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This caution is especially true for girls with pubertal onset at the edge of the normal range, whereas treatment of a very young girl may be warranted even in the absence of strong data. In girls with developmental disabilities where the goal of treatment may be suppression of menses rather than height preservation, alternate treatment approaches such as intramuscular (depot) medroxyprogesterone, continuous oral contraceptive pills, or intrauterine devices can be considered instead [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hormonal contraception for suppression of menstruation&quot;</a>). It is important to take a family-centered approach to the decision to initiate therapy for CPP by ensuring that the caregivers are fully informed about the pros and cons of the therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H568107578\"><span class=\"h2\">GnRH agonist therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For children with CPP, GnRH agonist administration results in an initial transient stimulation of gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary, followed by a complete, but reversible, suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis. The initial stimulation of gonadotropins is the basis for using these drugs in a stimulation test to distinguish CPP from peripheral precocity or benign pubertal variants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty#H59458426\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and evaluation of precocious puberty&quot;, section on 'Serum LH concentrations after GnRH agonist stimulation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23809021\"><span class=\"h3\">Formulations and dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sustained-release formulations of several GnRH agonists have been developed: intramuscular injections for monthly, three or six monthly dosing, and a subcutaneous implant that is surgically inserted every 12 months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72979\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72979 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The choice of GnRH agonist formulation depends on patient and clinician preference, and local regulatory approvals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These preparations have not been directly compared in randomized trials, but appear to be similarly effective in suppressing the pituitary-gonadal axis, as illustrated by the following examples: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial compared dosing schedules of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">leuprolide</a> acetate 7.5 mg monthly, 11.25 mg every three months, and 22.5 mg every three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The incidence of subjects with inadequate pubertal suppression (stimulated luteinizing hormone [LH] levels &gt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L)</span> during the first year of therapy was higher in the group treated with 11.25 mg every three months <span class=\"nowrap\">(7/21</span> subjects, 30 percent), as compared with the 7.5 mg monthly group <span class=\"nowrap\">(1/18</span> subjects) and 22.5 mg every three months group <span class=\"nowrap\">(1/13</span> subjects). However, inadequate suppression was rare during the second year of therapy. There was no difference in bone age advancement or change in predicted adult height among the three treatment groups during or at the end of the trial.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The three-month depot preparation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">leuprolide</a> was further evaluated in a dose-ranging study, in which patients were treated with either an 11.25 mg or 30 mg dose for 36 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The mean peak-stimulated LH concentrations were lower in the 30 mg dose group compared with the 11.25 mg dose group. However, both doses maintained sex steroid concentrations at prepubertal levels, with no clinical progression of puberty, and were well tolerated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A depot preparation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triptorelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triptorelin</a> pamoate was administered at a dose of 11.25 mg every three months for 12 months in an open-label trial. This treatment effectively inhibited the pituitary-gonadal axis, as demonstrated by peak LH values after GnRH stimulation of less than 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> in over 95 percent of children after 6 and 12 months of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, the effects on estradiol and testosterone suppression were not as consistent as those achieved with monthly administration of triptorelin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=triptorelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Triptorelin</a> at a dose of 22.5 mg every six months led to clinical and biochemical suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in a study of 44 children with CPP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The efficacy of this dose has not yet been compared with the monthly or three-monthly depot preparations. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A formulation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histrelin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">histrelin</a> acetate provides long-term gonadotropin suppression in children with CPP for up to one year with a single implantation and is approved in the United States for this use. In a multicenter trial of this formulation in boys and girls with CPP, peak LH and estradiol or testosterone were effectively suppressed, and no significant adverse effects were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Positive long-term safety and efficacy data have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. This formulation provides treatment for CPP without the pain and inconvenience of monthly injections, but requires a minor surgical procedure to insert the implant and to remove it. One study suggests that the suppressive action of an implant may last for two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. An observational study reported that menarche occurred at a mean of 12.75 months after removal of the implant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p>Short-acting GnRH agonist formulations are also available, including daily subcutaneous injections and multiple daily dosing intranasal sprays (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=nafarelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nafarelin</a> acetate). Depot preparations are preferable because of improved compliance and thus better pituitary-gonadal axis suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, in certain clinical situations, such as the development of sterile abscesses with depot GnRH agonist therapy, these daily preparations can be used as an alternative.</p><p>A typical approach to GnRH agonist depot dosing using formulations available in North America is described below. (See <a href=\"#H23809042\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23809028\"><span class=\"h3\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After GnRH agonist therapy has begun, follow-up monitoring should be performed to ensure that the goals of GnRH agonist therapy are being achieved (eg, suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis, slowing of development of secondary sexual characteristics and of bone age advancement, and ultimately improving final height). If treatment is effective, further breast and testicular development and menses should cease, and height velocity and rate of bone age advancement should decline. Therefore, routine monitoring should include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of pubertal development and growth every three to six months. Effective GnRH agonist therapy should result in a decrease in height velocity, cessation of menses, and arrest pubertal progression. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Periodic bone age measurements (eg, every 6 to 12 months), looking for a reduction in the bone age advancement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. Once this has been documented, bone age measurements can be performed less frequently (eg, every one to two years). </p><p/><p>In our practice, we do not routinely monitor serum LH and sex steroid concentrations during GnRH agonist therapy because we believe there are insufficient data to demonstrate that using such measurements to adjust therapy improves adult height outcomes. However, we recognize that this is a controversial topic and that other clinicians prefer to monitor biochemically for evidence of pituitary-gonadal axis suppression and adjust treatment accordingly. Such measurements include basal LH and sex steroid concentrations (estradiol in girls and testosterone in boys) or stimulated LH and sex steroid levels (after GnRH or a GnRH agonist). Native GnRH is not available in the United States; therefore, some clinicians use the next scheduled GnRH agonist injection for the stimulated LH sample. </p><p>Regardless of whether biochemical monitoring is performed, ongoing careful clinical assessment is paramount. If there is evidence of ongoing pubertal progression once therapy has begun, then the above biochemical measurements may be used to assess whether there is complete suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. If this testing shows incomplete suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis, the GnRH agonist dose should be increased or the interval between doses decreased. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty#H323253704\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and evaluation of precocious puberty&quot;, section on 'Basal serum LH'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty#H59458426\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and evaluation of precocious puberty&quot;, section on 'Serum LH concentrations after GnRH agonist stimulation'</a>.)</p><p>Within the first weeks after the initial dose of the GnRH agonist, vaginal bleeding may occur due to estradiol withdrawal, because the treatment initially stimulates estradiol production before suppressing the pituitary-gonadal axis. If vaginal bleeding occurs later in the course of treatment, this either indicates lack of suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis or an alternative diagnosis to CPP (eg, a cause of peripheral precocity). Pubic hair stage may advance due to adrenarche despite effective treatment with GnRH agonists because these agents have no effect on adrenal androgen production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H436360027\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of GnRH agonist therapy should be long enough to optimize final adult height, yet still allow progression of pubertal characteristics at an age that is concurrent with the individual's peers. When GnRH agonist therapy with monthly depot preparations is stopped, normal puberty returns, on average, within 12 to 18 months. </p><p>In one study, menarche occurred 17.5 &plusmn; 11.2 months after the last injection of GnRH.

For patients with CPP, the decision about whether to treat largely depends on the age of onset of CPP, the rate of sexual maturation, and the estimated adult height as determined by the rate of bone age advancement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72017\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72017 \">table 2</a>). In general, treatment is most likely to be beneficial for children who are younger, have rapid pubertal progression, and shorter predicted height. Children with slowly progressive forms of CPP do not require treatment because they reach their height potential without treatment. (See <a href=\"#H23809000\" class=\"local\">'Decision to treat'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If treatment for CPP is indicated, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are used. For children with progressive CPP, younger age at initiation of therapy is associated with greater height benefits. (See <a href=\"#H23809000\" class=\"local\">'Decision to treat'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Clinically significant increments in height potential are achieved with a variety of GnRH agonists, and outcome data are insufficient to recommend one form over another; several preparations are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72979\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72979 \">table 3</a>). The choice of GnRH agonist formulation depends on patient and clinician preference and local insurance and regulatory approvals; in our practice, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">leuprolide</a> depot given intramuscularly (IM), with either the one-month or three-month preparation. Because <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histrelin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">histrelin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triptorelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triptorelin</a> are not yet approved in Canada, they are not part of our clinical practice. (See <a href=\"#H23809021\" class=\"local\">'Formulations and dosing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23809042\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>During treatment with a GnRH agonist, patients should be monitored periodically for pubertal development, height velocity, and bone age to determine whether the dose is adequate. (See <a href=\"#H23809028\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral precocity is caused by excess secretion of sex hormones either from the gonads or adrenal glands, ectopic human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) production by a germ cell tumor, or by exogenous sources of sex steroids, and is GnRH-independent. Causes of peripheral precocity are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59268 \">table 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and evaluation of precocious puberty&quot;, section on 'Causes of peripheral precocity'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment for peripheral precocity is directed at removing or blocking the production of <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> response to the excess sex steroids; these patients do not respond to GnRH agonist therapy, unless they have developed secondary CPP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62460\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62460 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H23809049\" class=\"local\">'Treatment for peripheral precocity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign or non-progressive pubertal variants include isolated breast development (premature thelarche) or isolated characteristics such as pubic hair development mediated by androgens produced by early maturation of the adrenal glands (premature adrenarche). Either of these patterns usually is a variant of normal puberty and requires no intervention. However, clinical reexamination and follow-up are important to confirm the diagnosis because some patients with an initial presentation that is consistent with a benign pubertal variant will turn out to have a progressive disorder. (See <a href=\"#H23809070\" class=\"local\">'Benign or non-progressive pubertal variants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p><strong>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</strong> &mdash; The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Paul Saenger, MD, MACE, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lahlou N, Carel JC, Chaussain JL, Roger M.
