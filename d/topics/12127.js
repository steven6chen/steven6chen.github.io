However, glaucoma is more accurately defined as an optic neuropathy than a disease of high pressure. In open-angle glaucoma, optic nerve damage results in a progressive loss of retinal ganglion cell axons, which is manifested initially as visual field loss and, ultimately, irreversible blindness if left untreated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma in adults. Glaucoma in children, angle-closure glaucoma, and treatment and prevention of open-angle glaucoma are discussed elsewhere.

It is usually but not always in the presence of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Increased aqueous production <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreased outflow are possible mechanisms for elevated intraocular pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54950\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54950 \">figure 2</a>). The optic nerve or &quot;disc&quot; takes on a hollowed-out appearance on ophthalmoscopic examination, which is described as &quot;cupping.&quot; Cupping is associated with the loss of ganglion cell axons.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angle-closure glaucoma is characterized by narrowing or closure of the anterior chamber angle. The normal anterior chamber angle provides drainage for the aqueous humor (the fluid that fills the eyeball). When this drainage pathway is narrowed or closed, inadequate drainage leads to elevated IOP and damage to the optic nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59454\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59454 \">figure 3</a>). Acute angle-closure glaucoma occurs in eyes with a certain anatomical predisposition. It presents as a painful red eye and must be treated within 24 hours to prevent permanent blindness.

The prevalence of open-angle glaucoma is &lt;1 percent in individuals under 55 years of age, approaches 2 percent at age 65, and reaches approximately 4 percent at age 80 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The rate of blindness from open-angle glaucoma also increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Race</strong> &ndash; Race is an important risk factor for development and progression of open-angle glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The estimated prevalence of open-angle glaucoma is approximately three times higher in blacks compared with whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The age-adjusted rate of blindness from glaucoma among blacks was 6.6 times that among whites, with blindness beginning 10 years earlier in blacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The incidence of open-angle glaucoma in Latinos is higher than in non-Hispanic whites, though lower than in Afro-Caribbeans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Non-Hispanic white women comprise the largest group with open-angle glaucoma in the United States in 2011, but it is anticipated that this will shift to Hispanic men over the next several decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Family history</strong> &ndash; Family history is a significant risk factor for open-angle glaucoma in several population studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. The Baltimore Eye Survey found that the relative risk of open-angle glaucoma increased 3.7- and 2.2-fold for individuals with an affected sibling or parent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Several early-onset glaucoma syndromes are inherited as Mendelian dominant or recessive traits; open-angle glaucoma, however, has a complex inheritance pattern, with the likelihood that multiple genes interact with environmental factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Elevated intraocular pressure</strong> &ndash; There is a large body of literature illustrating the association between elevated IOP and both development and progression of open-angle glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/24-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As an example, the Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial followed 255 patients with a diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma over a mean of eight years; mean IOP was a significant risk factor for progression of glaucoma (hazard ratio [HR] 1.11, 95% CI 1.06-1.17), even when IOP was within the &quot;normal&quot; range of 8 to 22 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Nearly 40 percent of patients with otherwise characteristic open-angle glaucoma will not have an elevated IOP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These patients constitute a subgroup commonly referred to as low-tension or normal-tension glaucoma. While a small proportion of open-angle glaucoma in the United States may be classified as normal tension, the majority of patients with open-angle glaucoma in Asia have normal tension glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. By contrast, many patients with elevated pressures never develop the optic nerve and field changes characteristic of glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Thus, although high pressure is clearly associated with open-angle glaucoma, it is neither necessary nor sufficient for the diagnosis and is therefore termed a &quot;risk factor&quot; for the condition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypertension</strong> &ndash; Observational studies suggest an association between hypertension and primary open-angle glaucoma. A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis of 60 observational studies found that the risk for primary open-angle glaucoma was increased in patients with hypertension compared with those without (relative risk [RR] 1.16, 95% CI 1.05-1.28); nearly all studies noted an association between hypertension and increased intraocular pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diabetes</strong> &ndash; Observational studies also suggest an association between diabetes and primary open-angle glaucoma. A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis of 47 observational studies found that the risk for primary open-angle glaucoma was increased for patients with diabetes compared with those without (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.29-1.71) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The risk increased 5 percent each year after the diagnosis of diabetes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other factors</strong> &ndash; Other possible risk factors for developing open-angle glaucoma include myopia, pseudoexfoliation, low diastolic perfusion pressure, cardiovascular disease, and hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/34-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-39</a>].</p><p/><p>Although risk factors for the development of open-angle glaucoma have been well documented, risk factors for progression of open-angle glaucoma are less certain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. Results conflict whether fluctuation in IOP is predictive of glaucoma progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Even in patients with documented findings of glaucoma on comprehensive eye examination (eg, visual field deficits, optic disc changes), it is unclear which patients go on to develop loss of visual acuity and blindness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of primary open-angle glaucoma is not clear. Optic nerve axon loss may be related to ganglion cell susceptibility, microcirculatory deficiency at the optic nerve head, or extracellular matrix factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,44</a>]. These factors may play a combined role: circulatory or extracellular matrix factors could account for both high pressures and axon loss; variation in axon susceptibility might explain why the disease state does not correlate well with elevated IOP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. It is not clear if elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is caused by factors related to aqueous production, aqueous outflow, or anatomic or physiologic features of the trabecular meshwork and other outflow structures. Systemic factors may also play a role, as there is some evidence that cardiac autonomic dysfunction, as measured by heart rate variability, may correlate with the presence of normal pressure glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Mutations in the myocilin gene (MYOC) have been identified in about 4 percent of adults with open-angle glaucoma and in more than 10 percent of cases of juvenile open-angle glaucoma, a rare autosomal dominant condition with glaucoma onset between 3 and 40 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. MYOC mutations alter the myocilin protein. Myocilin-associated glaucoma is characterized by elevated IOP, with IOP &gt;40 mmHg in some patients with juvenile open-angle glaucoma. Myocilin is produced in the ciliary body and trabecular meshwork, but its precise role in regulating IOP is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with open-angle glaucoma rarely experience symptoms. Thus, open-angle glaucoma is generally detected incidentally during comprehensive ophthalmic examination. This is in contrast to angle-closure glaucoma in which patients present with symptoms and signs including loss of visual acuity, pain, conjunctival erythema, and corneal edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angle-closure-glaucoma#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angle-closure glaucoma&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>High elevations of intraocular pressure (IOP), up to 40 mmHg in patients with open-angle glaucoma, generally cause no pain, redness, or visual symptoms. There is no loss of visual acuity as long as central vision is preserved. Central visual field loss is a late manifestation of open-angle glaucoma, usually preceded by ganglion cell loss and optic nerve damage. Some patients are unaware of field loss even when it has progressed to central &quot;tunnel vision&quot; of 10 to 20 degrees. Visual field loss cannot be recovered once it has occurred.</p><p>The mean progression rate from a full field of vision to blindness takes approximately 25 years in untreated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, it is important to note that the median progression rate is much slower (approximately 70 years), since only a small minority of patients progress rapidly to blindness. Nonetheless, in a Swedish study of 592 glaucoma patients who had died between 2006 and 2010, 250 (42 percent) had at least one eye with blindness (as defined by the World Health Organization criteria) and 16.4 percent were bilaterally blind at their last eye visit; the median age for developing bilateral blindness was 86 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H447095064\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraocular pressure (IOP) testing (tonometry) remains the most available and best-studied screening test for glaucoma. However, many persons with primary open-angle glaucoma do not have increased IOP and not all persons with elevated IOP will develop glaucoma, so screening with tonometry alone may be inadequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Furthermore, there is no &quot;gold standard&quot; test for identifying glaucoma. It remains controversial which (if any) populations should be screened, what screening tests should be performed, and with what frequency. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1320774\"><span class=\"h2\">Evidence for treating elevated intraocular pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no available studies that directly address whether screening prevents visual impairment or worsened quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. A meta-analysis of 10 trials demonstrated that medical treatment for ocular hypertension reduced the risk of visual field defects (odds ratio [OR] 0.62, 95% CI 0.47-0.81) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Another meta-analysis of five randomized trials in adults with elevated IOP found that topical IOP-lowering medication, compared with placebo, decreased the risk of open-angle glaucoma (hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% CI 0.39-0.81) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The study estimated that 12 subjects with elevated IOP would need to be treated to prevent one case of glaucoma within five years of treatment.</p><p>Since the prevalence of elevated IOP in the general population is approximately 4 percent among individuals age &ge;40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>] and 12 patients would be needed to treat to prevent one case of glaucoma, 300 individuals would need to be screened to prevent one case of glaucoma within five years of treatment. However, primary open-angle glaucoma is a heterogeneous disease and does not progress in all patients or may progress at a rate that would not interfere with vision or quality of life in a person's lifetime.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1320003\"><span class=\"h2\">Cost-effectiveness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of randomized trials assessing screening strategies, several studies have attempted to determine the cost-effectiveness of glaucoma screening, with some using Markov modelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/53-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-56</a>]. One study in the United Kingdom found that neither IOP measurement alone nor comprehensive eye examination were cost-effective in subjects age &ge;40 years but that screening in older or other higher risk populations might be cost-effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Another study in Finland found that screening with combined fundus examination, visual field testing, and IOP measurement in persons age 50 to 89 was cost-effective for preventing visual disability (EUR &euro;32,603 per one year of avoided visual disability) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY; &euro;9023 per one QALY gained by screening) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. There is a great deal of uncertainty in the assumptions of these models, particularly with regard to which is the optimal screening protocol, the harms and benefits associated with early detection, and the thresholds for different treatments in relation to cost (determining follow-up, adherence, and additional testing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/53,55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,55,56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H447095071\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendations of others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is significant variation in screening recommendations from different organizations, partly since no randomized trials have evaluated screening strategies for the prevention of open-angle glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) recommends comprehensive eye examinations for patients with risk factors for glaucoma (eg, African-Americans and Hispanics) by an ophthalmologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The frequency depends on age: every one to two years in patients &lt;40 years, one to three years in patients age 40 to 54 years, one to two years in patients aged &ge;55 years. For patients without risk factors, the AAO suggests a comprehensive eye exam every 5 to 10 years in patients &lt;40, two to four years in patients 40 to 54 years, one to three years in patients 55 to 64 years, and one to two years in patients &ge;65 years. Screening only by measuring IOP is not appropriate since a substantial number of patients with glaucomatous visual field changes have normal IOP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Field testing is performed by the ophthalmologist once the patient falls into the diagnostic category of &quot;glaucoma suspect&quot; based upon the other risk factors.

While they felt there was good evidence that screening could detect increased IOP and early open-angle glaucoma, and that early treatment reduces the development and progression of visual field defects, they also felt that the evidence was insufficient to determine the extent to which screening would reduce impairment in vision-related function or quality of life.

Cupping describes a hollowed-out appearance of the optic nerve or &quot;disc&quot; on fundus examination. A cup whose diameter is greater than 50 percent of the vertical disc diameter is indicative of glaucoma.</p><p>Although cupping has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any other finding on eye examination, there is no single cutoff criteria that yields sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to make cupping a useful diagnostic test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

However, confrontational field testing, using the examiner's fingers, is not useful in the detection of glaucoma. Automated perimetry is an important diagnostic tool that is much more reliable at detecting visual field loss in glaucoma compared with confrontational field testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82102\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82102 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>There are several types of automated perimetry technologies, including standard threshold automated perimetry, frequency-doubling technology perimetry, and short-wavelength automated perimetry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Automated perimetry has become the standard of care for optometric and ophthalmic practice in the detection and monitoring of glaucoma, although there is a role for careful manual perimetry in some cases, particularly in patients with advanced field loss or dementia. Reliable field testing requires comprehension and cooperation on the part of the patient. Dementia and other mental or physical problems may preclude testing in certain individuals, forcing the clinician to rely upon other variables in diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making.</p><p>Visual field testing can be time consuming and of variable specificity and sensitivity, depending on user characteristics and the type of test being used. Newer technologies to measure visual fields with greater reliability are in development. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Newer technologies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Intraocular pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevated IOP alone does not establish the diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,70</a>]. One-third to one-half of individuals with glaucoma field defects have intraocular pressures &le;21 mmHg when first detected (normal IOP 8 to 21 mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. In addition, over 90 percent of adults with pressures &gt;21 mmHg have no optic nerve damage. However, patients with elevated IOP should be referred to an ophthalmologist given their higher risk of open-angle glaucoma. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>A prospective population study of risk factors associated with glaucomatous field loss found that, during a period of five years, 99 percent of eyes with an initial pressure &lt;20 mmHg continued to be free of glaucomatous field defects, compared with 93 percent of eyes with an initial pressure &ge;20 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. The sensitivity for the diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma by IOP measurement was 47.1 percent and the specificity over 90 percent at an IOP cutoff point of &gt;21 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The presence of either increased IOP (&gt;21 mmHg) or increased vertical <span class=\"nowrap\">cup/disc</span> ratio (&ge;0.5) increased the sensitivity to 61 percent but decreased the specificity to 84 percent. There was no cutoff value for IOP that had reasonable sensitivity and specificity as a screening tool for the diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma.</p><p>Ophthalmologists and optometrists can measure IOP by applanation tonometry, pneumotonometry, or air-puff tonometry. Applanation tonometry is a method that determines the IOP from the force required to flatten (applanate) a constant area of the cornea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59419\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59419 \">picture 2</a>). Applanation tonometry is most accurate and less subject to artifact. All tonometry methods require specialized equipment and skill and thus fall out of the realm of the primary care clinician. Due to the effects of central corneal thickness on the mechanics of applanation tonometry, falsely higher measurements occur in patients with thicker corneas and falsely lower measurements occur in those with thinner corneas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. This can be partially corrected with pachymetry. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Pachymetry'</a> below.)</p><p>Schiotz tonometry is a handheld device that is relatively inexpensive but requires frequent use for reliable results. Generalists who practice in populations that do not have access to optometric or ophthalmic care can learn Schiotz tonometry and use it in conjunction with the optic disc examination in deciding whom to treat or refer. In developed countries, it is less common for primary care providers to measure IOP.</p><p>There is some evidence that wearing a tight necktie may temporarily increase IOP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. The clinical implications of these findings require further study. Regardless, it is prudent to ask patients to loosen collars and ties prior to measuring IOP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h4\">Pressure parameters for referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no standard criteria for referral to an ophthalmologist for patients with elevated pressures. Primary open-angle glaucoma rarely presents with IOP &gt;30 mmHg, which is more common among patients with angle-closure glaucoma or secondary (rather than primary) open-angle glaucoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angle-closure-glaucoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angle-closure glaucoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-red-eye\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the red eye&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following represent indications for ophthalmologic referral based on clinical practice experience:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IOP &gt;40 mmHg &ndash; Emergency referral</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IOP 30 to 40 mmHg &ndash; Urgent referral (within 24 hours) if no symptoms suggesting acute glaucoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IOP 25 to 29 mmHg &ndash; Evaluation within one week</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IOP 23 to 24 mmHg &ndash; Repeat measurement to confirm <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> referral for comprehensive eye examination</p><p/><p>These indications are not absolute and should be interpreted in the context of patient history and examination findings. As an example, a patient with an IOP of 28 and advanced open-angle glaucoma including field loss and cupping may represent an emergency because of risk of imminent field loss, while a patient with a healthy nerve could withstand an IOP at that level for weeks with little risk of further nerve damage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Pachymetry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pachymetry is the measurement of corneal thickness; it can be performed by ultrasound or other methods.
