Procedures may include: liver resection, splenectomy, or surgery for bowel obstruction.</p><p>Residual disease is a significant prognostic factor after surgical cytoreduction, and the type of procedure varies based on site(s) of recurrence. The goal of surgical cytoreduction in recurrent ovarian cancer is complete gross resection to no residual disease. Diagnostic laparoscopy prior to secondary cytoreductive surgery may be of benefit similar to the paradigm applied in primary disease. In addition, laparoscopic or robotic approach may be reasonable with the possible benefit of shorter hospital length of stay and improved quality of life as compared to laparotomy. Findings at time of surgery usually correlate to imaging findings. If peritoneal carcinomatosis is found intraoperatively, surgical cytoreduction should be aborted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H566579404\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the setting of limited recurrent disease involving the liver, partial hepatic resection can be performed.

In these three retrospective reports, a total of 68 patients underwent hepatic resection for recurrent ovarian cancer. Median survival in these studies was reported as 26.3, 38, and 62 months. Factors associated with improved survival included optimal cytoreduction, negative margin status of the hepatic resection, pelvic versus abdominal disease, and time from original diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H566579411\"><span class=\"h2\">Splenectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spleen may be involved with upper abdominal disease in the setting of primary ovarian cancer. With recurrent disease, the spleen may be also be involved as an isolated site of metastasis or in the setting of carcinomatosis. Similar to liver resection, the data on splenectomy in surgery for recurrent ovarian cancer are limited to several single-institution reports. One report included six patients with isolated parenchymal splenic metastasis at a median of 57 months after initial surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-surgery-for-recurrent-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Another report included 24 patients, of whom 15 had multiple-site disease recurrence; the median overall survival was 56 months. Factors associated with improved survival included optimal secondary cytoreduction, disease-free survival, consolidation chemotherapy, and type of adjuvant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-surgery-for-recurrent-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H855932891\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no published data from randomized trials of secondary cytoreduction for ovarian cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-surgery-for-recurrent-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews of observational data show that complete secondary cytoreduction is associated with longer overall survival.</p><p>The largest systematic reviews or studies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of 40 studies included 2019 patients with ovarian cancer who underwent secondary cytoreductive surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-surgery-for-recurrent-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The median disease-free survival prior to secondary cytoreduction was 20.2 months and median postrecurrence survival was 30.3 months (range, 10.0 to 62.0 months). Complete cytoreduction was achieved in 52.2 percent (range, 9.4 to 100 percent). Average perioperative outcomes included: blood loss (range, 300 to 1000 mL), operative duration (range, 130 to 588 minutes), proportion of patients undergoing bowel resection (40.5 percent), significant perioperative morbidity (19.2 percent), and perioperative mortality (1.2 percent). Complete cytoreduction was associated with longer survival; for each 10 percent increase in the proportion of patients with complete cytoreduction, there was a 3.0-month increase in median survival time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review of nine studies (seven were retrospective) included 1194 patients, but this analysis was limited since much of the data could not be combined as a meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-surgery-for-recurrent-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Major surgical morbidity occurred in 22 percent, and there were two deaths related to perioperative complications and two due to disease progression.

An exception would be in the setting of limited peritoneal disease that results in a bowel obstruction. The majority of cases of bowel obstruction in recurrent ovarian cancer are due to peritoneal carcinomatosis and extensive disease resulting in studding of the bowel mesentery and decreased bowel motility. The intent of cytoreduction should not be the goal of surgery in this setting. In patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, systemic chemotherapy is often warranted but cannot be administered in the setting of bowel obstructions.
