EUS has been used increasingly for drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts, treatment of cystic lesions of the pancreas, EUS-guided cholangiopancreatography, localized therapy for pancreatic tumors, and treatment of subepithelial lesions and gastric varices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131645438\"><span class=\"h1\">DRAINAGE PROCEDURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EUS is well-suited to safely drain fluid collections of various types in areas accessible from the stomach, duodenum, or rectum. The most abundant experience has been with drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts, but case reports have described a variety of drainage procedures, including a hepatic abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], subphrenic abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], pelvic abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>], bilomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>], and infected gallbladders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131645446\"><span class=\"h2\">Pseudocysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The traditional endoscopic approach to transmural drainage of pseudocysts relies on the presence of an intraluminal bulge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> accurate cross-sectional imaging techniques to detect the location of the pseudocyst and determine the distance between the pseudocyst and gastric wall. Despite this information, avoidance of interposed vasculature can be challenging.</p><p>The technique of EUS-guided drainage starts with localization of the pseudocyst with EUS. A 19-gauge needle is then directed into the pseudocyst, with care being taken to avoid interposed vasculature. A guidewire is then introduced into the cavity under fluoroscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56108\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56108 \">image 1</a>), followed by transmural balloon dilation of the tract into the pseudocyst (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71061\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71061 \">image 2</a>). It is often difficult to place a dilating balloon catheter across the stomach wall. When this occurs, creating a fistulous tract with a push dilating catheter, a needle-knife, or a cystenterostome may aid with balloon placement. Once the tract is dilated, one or more plastic stents are placed into the pseudocyst cavity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68706\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68706 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72482\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72482 \">picture 2</a>) for drainage.</p><p>EUS-guided drainage from the duodenum can be technically challenging because the oblique view from a linear echoendoscope makes endoscopic visualization more difficult than a standard side-viewing duodenoscope. Ongoing development of forward-viewing and side-viewing echoendoscopes may improve these technical limitations and improve endoscopic visualization.</p><p>The endoscopic management of pancreatic pseudocysts is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic management of walled-off pancreatic fluid collections: Efficacy and complications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic management of walled-off pancreatic fluid collections: Techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131645454\"><span class=\"h2\">Subphrenic abscesses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Case series have described drainage of subphrenic abscesses in two patients under EUS guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In an illustrative report, the abscess was perisplenic, measuring 4 x 5.5 cm, in a patient with portal hypertension and multiple venous collaterals in the region, which were thought to be too high risk for a percutaneous approach. The second case was a 5 x 2.5 cm left subphrenic abscess complicating a Nissen fundoplication. In both cases, the cysts were punctured using a linear array echoendoscope, followed by placement of a 0.035 inch guidewire, looping it inside the cyst. Over the wire, a 7 Fr naso-abscess drainage catheter was placed along with an adjacent 10 Fr double pigtail catheter. The catheters were flushed with 500 cc sterile saline three times per day and removed after eight days. The patients were both treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a> for the first five days. The stents were removed after repeat EUS at four weeks later demonstrated complete resolution.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131645462\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatic abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One report described a patient with a 7 x 11 cm left lobe hepatic abscess that was drained using a similar technique as described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] under EUS guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The abscess was flushed three times daily through a nasobiliary catheter for seven days. A stent was not placed. The patient did well without recurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131645470\"><span class=\"h2\">Bilomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Case reports have described successful drainage of a biloma with EUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. The largest report described four patients with bile leaks and gallbladder fossa bilomas who were drained via EUS-guided double pigtail stent placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. ERCP was performed initially with placement of a biliary endoprosthesis. Subsequently, a 19-gauge needle was used to access the biloma from the stomach or proximal duodenum, a 0.035 inch guidewire was used to secure access, and 6 to 8 mm balloon dilators were used to dilate the fistula. In one case, a single pigtail stent was placed, and in the other three, one to two double pigtail stents were left in place to drain the bilomas. The size of the fluid collections ranged from 4 x 2 cm up to 8 x 6 cm. Antibiotic coverage was given the day of the procedure and for 10 to 14 days afterward. The duration of drainage was 11 days in one case, and one to three months in the others. No complications were reported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131645478\"><span class=\"h2\">Gallbladder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholecystectomy is generally preferred for management of acute cholecystitis but is not always an option due to comorbidities. Case series have demonstrated the feasibility of EUS-guided gallbladder drainage in such patients. This is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis#H1055793\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute calculous cholecystitis&quot;, section on 'Endoscopic'</a>.)</p><p>EUS-guided gallbladder drainage has also been studied in patients with malignant cystic duct obstruction. In a series of 14 patients with acute cholecystitis as a result of malignant cystic duct obstruction, EUS-guided transgastric or transduodenal drainage with a covered metal stent was performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The technical and clinical success rates of EUS-guided gallbladder drainage were 86 percent and 92 percent, respectively. This outcome was similar to the success rates of percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (100 percent and 86 percent, respectively). The groups also had similar adverse event rates. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131645486\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvic abscesses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Case series have described drainage of pelvic and perirectal abscesses by EUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>One series involved 25 patients with abscesses that were predominantly postsurgical or posttraumatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients with abscesses less than 8 cm in size were treated with two 7 Fr transrectal stents. If the abscess was 8 cm or more in size, a 10 Fr drainage catheter was also placed. The drainage catheter was removed once the abscess had decreased in size by at least 50 percent, and the stents were removed after two weeks. The abscesses were successfully drained in all of the patients at the time of EUS and there were no procedure-related complications. In 24 patients, there was complete resolution of the abscesses on follow-up CT at two weeks.</p><p>Another case series included 12 patients with abscesses mostly from pelvic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Stents were inserted successfully in nine patients, resulting in complete resolution of the abscesses in eight, and incomplete resolution in one with a large cyst (&gt;8 cm) that required subsequent surgical management. Stents were removed after three to six months. In the three patients who were not amenable to stent placement, two had recurrence of the abscess following aspiration. No major complications were encountered. The only significant difference in technique to the drainage procedures described above was the use of a needle-knife for puncture of the abscess wall prior to guidewire insertion and balloon dilation.</p><p>These data suggest EUS-guidance can be a safe, effective technique for drainage of pelvic abscesses. Placement of drainage catheters or stents appears to be crucial for successful resolution, since recurrence rates are high with aspiration alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131645494\"><span class=\"h1\">FINE-NEEDLE INJECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EUS permits precise targeting for the delivery of various substances directly into pancreas, liver, or subepithelial lesions. EUS-guided injection of ethanol for celiac plexus neurolysis has been performed for over a decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. More recently, EUS-guided fine-needle injection (FNI) of various substances has been reported for treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], insulinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], hepatic metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], esophageal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>], cystic neoplasms of the pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>], and pancreatic adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

More recently, EUS-FNI (1.5 mL of 95 percent ethanol directly into the tumor in a single session) was used to treat a 4 cm symptomatic GIST in the stomach of a poor surgical candidate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Treatment was associated with complete resolution of the tumor. The patient developed abdominal pain one week after the injection, and ulcer formation documented on endoscopy seven weeks after the injection, which had healed by the follow-up EUS at six months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131645518\"><span class=\"h2\">Insulinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A case report described EUS-FNI of a symptomatic 13 mm insulinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The tumor was ablated after injecting 8 cc of 95 percent ethanol in four 2 mL aliquots. No tumor recurrence was observed based upon surveillance EUS or development of recurrent symptoms after 34 months of follow-up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131645526\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatic metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have described percutaneous ablation of hepatic metastases with ethanol injection. Ablation with EUS-FNI has been described only in a case report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The patient had a solitary liver metastasis from rectal cancer, measuring 1.6 cm that was not amenable to percutaneous approach due to vascular interposition. Ethanol, at a concentration of 95 percent and a volume averaging 6 mL, was used during multiple EUS-FNI sessions several weeks apart.</p><p>The patient had a good response, with disappearance of the lesion and a decrease in CEA level. He eventually had an additional lesion that was treated similarly with four sessions with a good response. The only complication was a subcapsular hematoma after one procedure. At the time of the report, the patient was still alive and in relatively good health 5.5 years after the initial diagnosis of metastatic cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131645534\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatic adenocarcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various biologic anti-tumor agents have been introduced into pancreatic cancers under EUS-guided FNI for control of locally advanced disease. Although long-term results are not well studied, preliminary results suggest these approaches are generally safe and may prove to be an adjunct or alternative to traditional chemoradiation therapies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131645542\"><span class=\"h3\">Cytoimplant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EUS-guided intratumoral injection for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer was first reported in 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The study evaluated the safety and feasibility of injecting a mixed lymphocyte culture of donor and host mononuclear cells (cytoimplant) into the tumor with EUS-guided FNI. It was hypothesized that the mixed lymphocyte reaction would result in activation of immune effector cells and release of cytokines with tumor suppressive properties.</p><p>Of eight patients, two had partial responses and one a minor response with a median survival of 13.2 months. There were no procedure-related complications. Although no additional studies of cytoimplant have been reported, this was the first study to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of EUS-guided FNI for the treatment of locally advanced tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196737562\"><span class=\"h3\">TNFerade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TNFerade is a replication-deficient adenoviral vector that contains the human TNF-alpha gene regulated by Egr-1, a chemoradiation inducible promoter. When combined with subsequent chemoradiation, TNF-alpha levels in the tumor increase, potentially leading to tumor suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>A multicenter study (presented as an abstract) described transfer of TNFerade into locally advanced pancreatic cancer via endoscopic ultrasound or percutaneous (PTA) guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Of the 37 patients treated, stabilization of tumor was observed in 83 percent at one month and 74 percent at three months. Tumor area reduction of greater than 25 percent at one month and 50 percent at three months occurred in 31 and 11 percent of cases, respectively. Survival without overall progression was 63 percent at one month and 47 percent at three months. The therapy was generally well tolerated and considered safe and effective.</p><p>A phase <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> study found less promising results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. TNFerade was injected into locally advanced pancreatic carcinomas in 50 patients. Only 20 patients (40 percent) were free from local progression at three months.</p><p>In March 2010, a phase III trial using TNFerade injections into locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma was terminated early when interim analysis showed only an 8 percent lower risk of death with projected inability to reach a statistically significant improvement in outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131645558\"><span class=\"h2\">Brachytherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interstitial brachytherapy is used for treatment of various cancers including head, neck, breast, lung, prostate, and gastrointestinal tract. After radioactive seed placement, the target tissue is exposed to gamma radiation, producing localized tissue injury and tumor ablation. A potential advantage of brachytherapy over traditional external beam radiotherapy is limited radiation toxicity to surrounding normal tissue. (See appropriate topic reviews).</p><p>The radioactive seeds are usually implanted under CT-guidance or during laparotomy. However, EUS-guided brachytherapy has been reported for head and neck tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], recurrent esophageal cancer with perigastric adenopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and pancreatic adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>An illustrative series included 15 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer who underwent EUS-guided implantation of an average of 22 radioactive seeds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. During a median follow-up of 11 months, 27 percent of patients demonstrated a &quot;partial&quot; tumor response, 20 percent showed a &quot;minimal&quot; response, and 33 percent demonstrated &quot;stable disease.&quot; Clinical benefit was shown in up to 30 percent of patients, mostly due to a reduction in pain.</p><p>Pancreatitis occurred in three patients with formation of a pseudocyst in two of the three patients. However, these adverse events were considered mild and treated conservatively without additional therapy. This study demonstrated that EUS-guided brachytherapy was technically feasible and generally well tolerated, but more studies are needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131645566\"><span class=\"h2\">OncoGel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OncoGel is a chemotherapeutic formulation for intralesional injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> for local treatment of unresectable solid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This product uses a thermosensitive, biodegradable copolymer, ReGel, to deliver paclitaxel to solid tumors, providing continuous controlled-release into the surrounding tissue for up to six weeks. OncoGel is undergoing clinical studies within the United States for the treatment of incurable lung and breast cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131645574\"><span class=\"h2\">Esophageal cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, TNFerade, an adenoviral vector that carries the transgene encoding human TNF-alpha, has been used for treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/19,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,26</a>].

The vector was injected directly into the tumors, 18 patients with traditional endoscopy and six with EUS-FNI. Results were promising with minimal morbidity, and a 40 percent pathologic complete response in the top three dose cohorts. At the time of the final report, median follow-up was 42.9 months, and three- and five-year disease free survival rates were 57 and 52 percent, respectively. Further studies have not been published. There was a non-significant trend toward increased efficacy but prolonged procedure times using EUS compared with traditional endoscopy.</p><p>A case report described the use of EUS-FNI to place specially adapted brachytherapy beads for nodal spread of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A 66 year old woman with T3 N1 M0 disease had disease recurrence manifested by celiac lymph node recurrence after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and external beam radiation, and surgical resection with gastric pull-through. The celiac lymph node was treated with CT-guided brachytherapy bead placement. Subsequent recurrence manifested by two lymph nodes at the diaphragmatic crus was not amenable to percutaneous placement; as a result, EUS-FNI was used. Two I(125) beads were placed that had been designed to fit within a 19-gauge needle, which was sealed with sterile bone wax to prevent a bead from prematurely dislodging from the needle.

Repeated procedures on a scheduled basis significantly reduced the frequency of late rebleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective series of five patients with bleeding gastric varices described experience with EUS-guided injection of 1 mL of 1:1 CYA-lipiodol or Glubran2-lipiodol, focusing on localization of the perforating veins as the target for injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Hemostasis was achieved in all five patients. Eradication of the varices was successful in two patients after one session, and in three patients after two sessions (mean 1.6). There were no cases of recurrent bleeding over a 10-month follow-up period, and no complications were encountered. The authors noted that EUS-FNI may have an advantage over traditional endoscopy due to a lack of need for good endoscopic visualization to target the injection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third series described 14 patients who were treated with EUS-guided treatment injection of a coil with or without glue for esophagogastric or ectopic varices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Five of the patients had gastric varices. During a median follow-up of 12 months, 57 percent experienced no further bleeding, three died of unrelated causes, and three had a significant decrease in bleeding frequency. All five of the patients with gastric varices had no further bleeding, though one patient did die from his underlying disease during follow-up.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131645614\"><span class=\"h2\">Botulinum toxin for achalasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At least two case series reported the use of EUS-FNI of botulinum toxin directly into the lower esophageal sphincter to ensure proper localization of the injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

Thirteen underwent intrahepatic intervention with EUS-guided access from the stomach into the left intrahepatic ducts using either a 19- or 22-gauge needle. In 11 patients, a transpapillary stent was placed with one patient requiring the creation of a cholangiogastric fistula and placement of a double pigtail stent for biliary decompression. The obstruction resolved in 12 of 13 patients for a success rate of 92 percent. The one patient in whom intervention was unsuccessful had primary sclerosing cholangitis with multiple strictures precluding passage of a guidewire.</p><p>Extrahepatic intervention was attempted in 10 patients with successful placement of a biliary stent in nine. Two patients underwent creation of a choledochoduodenal fistula and one required a choledochogastric fistula. The single failure occurred in a patient with an impacted stone that required percutaneous transhepatic drainage with subsequent stent internalization. Complications included bile leak, minor bleeding, and self-limited pneumoperitoneum. Overall, the success rate was 91 percent with a complication rate of 17 percent and only one major complication (bile leak, 4 percent).</p><p>The same group also published their experience with EUS-guided drainage of the main pancreatic duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Thirteen patients with failed ERCP underwent EUS-guided pancreaticogastrostomy for endoprosthesis placement and decompression of the main pancreatic duct. Successful drainage was established in 10 of 13 patients (77 percent). Complications included one case of bleeding treated with endoclip placement and one case of a contained perforation. No major complications were encountered.</p><p>EUS-guided cholangiopancreatography is technically feasible and relatively safe in the hands of experienced interventional endoscopists skilled in both ERCP and EUS. This technique offers a potential alternative to surgery in patients in whom conventional ERCP is unsuccessful or not possible. However, the risk of complications including biliary peritonitis, pancreatitis, bleeding, perforation, and stent migration needs to be evaluated in larger numbers of patients with longer follow-up to determine the true potential for this approach. Currently, this procedure should be reserved for tertiary centers with highly skilled endoscopists using a multidisciplinary approach (ie, pancreatic surgeons, interventional radiologists) to these challenging cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131645654\"><span class=\"h1\">EUS-GUIDED FIDUCIAL PLACEMENT FOR CYBERKNIFE THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CyberKnife stereotactic radiotherapy delivers multiple beams of precisely directed radiation to a tumor using real-time image guidance. Radiographic markers (fiducials) are implanted at the tumor site as reference points to assist in targeting the radiation beams.</p><p>Fiducials have traditionally been placed surgically or percutaneously under ultrasound or computed tomography guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. More recently, case series have demonstrated the feasibility of placing them with EUS. In one series, for example, EUS was used to place fiducials in patients with tumors located in the mediastinum, retrocardiac region, retrocrural region, esophagogastric junction, porta hepatis, and pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Placement was successful in 11 of 13 patients (85 percent) with one failure secondary to gastric outlet obstruction precluding endosonographic visualization of the tumor, and the second failure due to intervening vasculature with increased risk for bleeding with needle puncture. Of 13 patients, seven were treated for pancreatic cancer with successful fiducial placement in 100 percent.</p><p>The technique for fiducial placement was similar to the previously mentioned approach for EUS-guided brachytherapy. After loading the fiducial into a 19-gauge needle and partially withdrawing the stylet to allow room, the fiducial is placed under EUS guidance near the treatment field (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59445\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59445 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81971\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81971 \">image 5</a>) to assist monitoring of respiratory variation under fluoroscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50550\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50550 \">image 6</a>).</p><p>A single complication occurred after fiducial placement in a patient with porta hepatis lymph node metastasis from colorectal cancer. The patient was admitted 25 days after the procedure for cholangitis and treated with antibiotics and percutaneous biliary drainage. Following this case, all patients were treated with prophylactic antibiotics followed by a three-day course after the procedure.</p><p>Another series (reported in abstract form) described experience with EUS-guided fiducial placement in patients with unresectable gastrointestinal malignancies (ie, pancreatic cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, recurrent gastric and colon cancer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Fiducials were successfully placed in 15 of 16 (94 percent) patients with no adverse clinical outcomes.</p><p>In our own published experience, 51 patients underwent EUS-guided fiducial placement for locally advanced (n = 36) or recurrent (n = 15) pancreatic cancer. Successful placement was achieved in 90 percent, with spontaneous migration in 7 percent and technical failure in 8 percent (all in patients with recurrent cancer after pancreaticoduodenectomy). Only one complication of mild pancreatitis occurred in a patient who underwent simultaneous celiac plexus neurolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p>EUS-guided fiducial placement for stereotactic radiosurgery appears to be safe and feasible.

Since then, several case reports and case series have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of this technique for both pancreatic endocrine tumors and pancreatic adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. Once the tumor is localized with EUS, fine-needle injection is performed with various dyes (eg, India ink, purified carbon particles [SPOT], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indocyanine green</a>) to tattoo the tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70994\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70994 \">picture 3</a>). EUS-FNT may provide better localization of small tumors, thereby limiting the amount of resected pancreatic parenchyma, an important goal for a minimally invasive surgery. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131645662\"><span class=\"h1\">EUS-GUIDED ANGIOGRAPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EUS-guided angiography is a potential alternative to the traditional percutaneous route for accessing the vascular system.
