It occurs at a median age of 51.4 years in normal women and is a reflection of complete, or near complete, ovarian follicular depletion, with resulting hypoestrogenemia and high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72948\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72948 \">figure 1</a>). Menopause before age 40 years is considered to be abnormal and is referred to as primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure). The menopausal transition, or perimenopause, occurs after the reproductive years, but before menopause, and is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, endocrine changes, and symptoms such as hot flashes.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical features and diagnosis of the menopausal transition and menopause. The physiology and epidemiology of menopause, postmenopausal hormone therapy, and primary ovarian insufficiency are reviewed separately.

It is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles and marked hormonal fluctuations, often accompanied by hot flashes, sleep disturbances, mood symptoms, and vaginal dryness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>] (see <a href=\"#H952677165\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> below). In addition, changes in lipids and bone loss begin to occur, both of which have implications for long-term health.</p><p>Virtually all women experience the menstrual irregularity and hormonal fluctuations prior to clinical menopause; up to 80 percent develop hot flashes (the most common menopausal symptom), but only 20 to 30 percent seek medical attention for treatment. (See <a href=\"#H172096462\" class=\"local\">'Hot flashes'</a> below.)</p><p>Much of the available information about the endocrine and clinical manifestations of the menopausal transition comes from a number of longitudinal cohort studies of midlife women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/7-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-19</a>], the largest of which, the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), has followed a multiethnic, community-based cohort of over 3000 women ages 42 to 52 years for 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/7,12-14,16,17,20-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12-14,16,17,20-29</a>]. Based upon data from the cohort studies, a staging system was developed that is now considered to be the gold standard for characterizing reproductive aging from the reproductive years through menopause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82933\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82933 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H172091386\" class=\"local\">'The STRAW staging system'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H171787387\"><span class=\"h2\">Menstrual cycle and endocrine changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical menstrual cycle and hormonal changes that women experience as they traverse from the premenopausal or reproductive years through the postmenopausal years include the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82933\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82933 \">figure 2</a>):</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172092802\"><span class=\"h3\">Late reproductive years</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the late reproductive years before the onset of the menopausal transition, serum inhibin B begins to decrease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) increases slightly, estradiol levels are preserved, but luteal phase progesterone levels decrease as fertility potential begins to decline (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F77945\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77945 \">figure 3</a>). Menstrual cycles are ovulatory, but the follicular phase (the first half of the menstrual cycle before ovulation occurs) begins to shorten (eg, 10 versus 14 days) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F79769\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79769 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Women who are having difficulty conceiving often seek advice about their menopausal status during this stage. Although there is variability in age at any given stage of reproductive aging, women are typically in their 40s when cycles begin to shorten. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-female-infertility#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of female infertility&quot;, section on 'Assessment of ovarian reserve'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172092809\"><span class=\"h3\">Menopausal transition/perimenopause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As the process of ovarian follicular depletion continues in midlife (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72948\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72948 \">figure 1</a>), women eventually experience a change in intermenstrual interval. The change in bleeding pattern, which is accompanied by hormonal fluctuations and a variety of symptoms, is referred to as the menopausal transition, or perimenopause, and occurs on average at age 47 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Women typically first notice a lengthening in the intermenstrual interval (in contrast to the shortening that occurs in the late reproductive years). Normal intermenstrual interval during the reproductive years is 25 to 35 days; during the menopausal transition, this may increase to 40 to 50 days. Early follicular phase FSH levels are high but variable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82324\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82324 \">figure 5</a>). The initial stage of the menopausal transition is referred to as the &quot;early transition&quot; in the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) staging system, which is described below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82933\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82933 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H172091386\" class=\"local\">'The STRAW staging system'</a> below.)</p><p>After the initial lengthening of intermenstrual interval, women then develop more dramatic menstrual cycle changes with skipped cycles, episodes of amenorrhea, and an increasing frequency of anovulatory cycles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82324\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82324 \">figure 5</a>). This stage is referred to as the &quot;late transition&quot; in the STRAW staging system and typically lasts for one to three years before the FMP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82933\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82933 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] (see <a href=\"#H172091386\" class=\"local\">'The STRAW staging system'</a> below). Of note, not all women follow a &quot;typical&quot; bleeding pattern. Some will have episodes of amenorrhea interspersed with short ovulatory cycles that resemble those of the late reproductive stage.</p><p>The more irregular cycles are accompanied by more dramatic fluctuations in serum FSH and estradiol concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82324\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82324 \">figure 5</a>). A random serum sample may demonstrate high FSH and low estradiol concentrations consistent with menopause, but soon thereafter, FSH and estradiol may return to the normal premenopausal range (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82324\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82324 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. One study reported that a random serum FSH &gt;25 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> is characteristic of the late menopausal transition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], but measurements of serum FSH during the late menopausal transition are not routinely recommended, because of their variability. (See <a href=\"#H171787807\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Other endocrine changes across the menopausal transition include a progressive decrease in serum inhibin B, as well as a decrease in anti-m&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH), another product of the granulosa cell. In addition, ovarian antral follicle count (AFC), defined as follicles measuring 2 to 10 mm in diameter on transvaginal ultrasound, declines steadily from the reproductive years though postmenopause. Inhibin B, AMH, and AFC have all been used to assess ovarian reserve in the setting of assisted reproductive techniques, but none are validated for the evaluation of menopausal status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-female-infertility#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of female infertility&quot;, section on 'Assessment of ovarian reserve'</a>.)</p><p>In general, the transition is characterized by a gradual decrease in menstrual bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, some women do experience heavy or prolonged bleeding, which has always been assumed to be due to anovulatory cycles and prolonged exposure to unopposed estrogen. However, in one report, the heaviest bleeding occurred in women in the late transition during ovulatory cycles, which were more likely than anovulatory cycles to be associated with high serum estradiol concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Women with obesity and uterine fibroids are also more likely to experience heavy bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The evaluation and management of heavy (&gt;80 mL) and prolonged bleeding (&gt;7 days) is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of abnormal uterine bleeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172092817\"><span class=\"h3\">Menopause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the years of menstrual irregularity, women eventually experience permanent cessation of menses. Twelve months of amenorrhea is considered to represent clinical menopause and is termed &quot;postmenopause&quot; in the STRAW system. The FMP is determined retrospectively. Although the median age at natural menopause is 51.4 years, the timing of menopause is affected by a number of factors, including genetics and smoking, which are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women#H179689159\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian development and failure (menopause) in normal women&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>The increase in serum FSH becomes sustained near the FMP, then increases over several years to levels in the 70 to 100 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> range, followed by a decline with increasing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469399902\"><span class=\"h4\">Predicting the final menstrual period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Being able to estimate the timing of the FMP has greater importance than simply allowing women to know when they will reach menopause, as accelerated bone loss and an increase in cardiovascular risk factors occur in the year leading up to the FMP (see <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Long-term consequences of estrogen deficiency'</a> below). Previous data suggested that women who had experienced at least three months of amenorrhea could expect their FMP within the next four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Investigators from the SWAN study have now developed a model based upon one current and one previous serum level of estradiol and FSH that estimate whether a woman is within one or two years of their FMP or beyond their FMP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The model will need to be validated in another cohort before being considered for clinical use.</p><p>It has also been suggested that the age range in which menopause will eventually occur can be calculated based upon an individual's current age and serum concentration of AMH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The addition of body mass index (BMI) and smoking status as additional variables may improve AMH-based prediction of age at menopause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H952677165\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmark symptom of the menopausal <span class=\"nowrap\">transition/perimenopause</span> and early postmenopausal years is the hot flash. Women may experience a number of other symptoms whose association with the menopausal transition is well established, including vaginal dryness, sleep disturbances, and new-onset depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. For other symptoms such as joint pain and memory loss, the association with menopause is less clear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172096462\"><span class=\"h3\">Hot flashes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptom during the menopausal transition and menopause are hot flashes (also referred to as vasomotor symptoms or hot flushes), which occur in up to 80 percent of women in some cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/21,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,40-42</a>]. However, only approximately 20 to 30 percent of women seek medical attention for treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/22,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,43,44</a>]. Some women first develop hot flashes that cluster around menses during their late reproductive years, but symptoms are typically mild and do not require treatment. Symptoms become far more common during the menopausal transition, with a frequency of approximately 40 percent in the early transition, increasing to 60 to 80 percent in the late menopausal transition and early postmenopausal periods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82933\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82933 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F114375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114375 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/22,23,32,41,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23,32,41,45</a>]. When hot flashes occur at night, women typically describe them as &quot;night sweats.&quot;</p><p>Hot flashes typically begin as the sudden sensation of heat centered on the upper chest and face that rapidly becomes generalized. The sensation of heat lasts from two to four minutes, is often associated with profuse perspiration and occasionally palpitations, and is sometimes followed by chills and shivering, and a feeling of anxiety. Hot flashes usually occur several times per day, although the range may be from only one or two each day to as many as one per hour during the day and night. Hot flashes are particularly common at night. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hot-flashes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hot flashes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More than 80 percent of women who have hot flashes will continue to have them for more than one year. Untreated, hot flashes stop spontaneously within four to five years of onset in most women. However, some women have hot flashes that persist for many years, with 9 percent reporting persistent symptoms after age 70 years.</p><p>A more detailed discussion of the pathophysiology, risk factors for, and treatment of hot flashes is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hot-flashes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hot flashes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Sleep disturbance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A distressing feature of hot flashes is that they are more common at night than during the day and are associated with arousal from sleep. However, women experience sleep disturbances even in the absence of hot flashes. The estimated prevalence of difficulty sleeping based upon two longitudinal cohort studies was 32 to 40 percent in the early menopausal transition, increasing to 38 to 46 percent in the late transition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/42,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,46</a>].</p><p>Anxiety and depression symptoms may also contribute to sleep disturbances; in one study, they were predictive of subjective sleep disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In addition, perimenopausal women with hot flashes are more likely to be depressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Primary sleep disorders are also common in this population. In a report of 102 women ages 44 to 56 years who reported sleep disturbances, 54 (53 percent) had sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Thus, in peri- or postmenopausal women who report sleep disturbances, treating the vasomotor symptoms may decrease sleep disturbances, but this may not resolve all sleep problems, as there are many other things that can disturb sleep, such as primary sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

The risk then decreases in the early postmenopause. In a within-woman, eight-year, longitudinal study to determine risk factors for depressive disorders, a diagnosis of depression was 2.5 times more likely to occur in the menopausal transition compared with when the woman was premenopausal (odds ratio [OR] 2.50; 95% CI 1.25-5.02) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>The role of estrogen in the treatment of depression in perimenopausal women is discussed separately.

This results in vaginal atrophy (atrophic vaginitis), causing symptoms of vaginal dryness, itching, and often dyspareunia. The prevalence of vaginal dryness in one longitudinal study was 3, 4, 21, and 47 percent of women in the reproductive, early menopausal transition, late menopausal transition, and three years postmenopausal stages, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/40,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,42</a>]. Symptoms of vaginal atrophy are usually progressive and worsen as time passes and hypoestrogenism continues.</p><p>Early in the menopause transition, women may notice a slight decrease in vaginal lubrication upon sexual arousal, which is often one of the first signs of estrogen insufficiency. As the hypoestrogenic state becomes chronic, additional symptoms may be reported by the woman, including a sensation of vaginal dryness during daily activities, not necessarily during sexual activity.

The external genitalia may show scarce pubic hair, diminished elasticity and turgor of the vulvar skin, introital narrowing or decreased moisture, and fusion or resorption of the labia minora.

Vaginal dryness and dyspareunia, as described above, may also contribute to reduced sexual function. The cervix also can atrophy and become flush with the top of the vaginal vault. The elasticity of the vaginal wall may decrease, and the entire vagina can become shorter or narrower. Continuing sexual activity may prevent these changes in size and shape of the vagina, even in the absence of estrogen therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

It is considered the gold standard for characterizing reproductive aging from the reproductive years through menopause and includes criteria for the reproductive years, the menopausal transition, perimenopause, final menstrual period (FMP), and postmenopause based upon bleeding patterns, endocrine findings, and symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82933\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82933 \">figure 2</a>). The menopausal transition and postmenopause are further subdivided into &quot;early&quot; and &quot;late&quot; stages.</p><p>Although the STRAW system has been used primarily for women's health research, it may be helpful in the clinical setting for patients and clinicians to assess fertility potential, contraceptive needs, and potential need for hormone therapy.

All four criteria have been used to assess ovarian reserve in the setting of assisted reproductive technologies, but none have been validated for use in the evaluation of menopausal status.

Therefore, for women over age 45 years who present with irregular menstrual cycles with menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, mood changes, or sleep disturbance, we suggest no further diagnostic evaluation, as they are highly likely to be in the menopausal transition.</p><p>Although serum FSH is often measured, it is not necessary to make the diagnosis and, if normal, may be misleading. In the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) longitudinal cohort study described above, changes in menstrual bleeding patterns were a better predictor of menopausal stage or FMP than serum FSH concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The possibility of pregnancy must always be considered and a serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) should be drawn in sexually active women who are not using reliable contraception.</p><p>We recommend additional endocrine testing (eg, prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) in this group if there are any suggestive features of hyperprolactinemia or thyroid disease (galactorrhea, goiter, tachycardia, proptosis, etc).

(See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Vaginal dryness'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Sexual function'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women during the menopausal transition appear to have a higher rate of mood symptoms than pre- or postmenopausal women. (See <a href=\"#H952676297\" class=\"local\">'Depression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) staging system was developed based upon data from multiple longitudinal cohort studies. It is considered the gold standard for characterizing reproductive aging from the reproductive years through menopause and includes criteria for the reproductive years, the menopausal transition, perimenopause, FMP, and postmenopause based upon bleeding patterns, endocrine findings, and symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82933\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82933 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H172091386\" class=\"local\">'The STRAW staging system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of the menopausal transition is made in women over 45 years based upon irregular menstrual cycles and menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, mood changes, or sleep disturbance. We suggest no further diagnostic evaluation. Although serum FSH is often measured, it offers no additional information, and may be misleading. (See <a href=\"#H171787807\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Menopause may be diagnosed clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over age 45 years in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. We do not recommend further diagnostic evaluation for women in this group. (See <a href=\"#H93667232\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in women over age 45 years with <strong>any</strong> symptoms suggestive of hyperthyroidism. (See <a href=\"#H171787807\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women between the ages of 40 and 45 years who present with irregular menstrual cycles and menopausal symptoms may be in the menopausal transition. However, for women in this age group, with or without menopausal symptoms, we recommend the same endocrine evaluation as for any woman with <span class=\"nowrap\">oligo/amenorrhea:</span> serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), prolactin, TSH, FSH. (See <a href=\"#H172086734\" class=\"local\">'Ages 40 to 45 years'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women under age 40 years with irregular menses and menopausal symptoms, we recommend a complete evaluation for premature ovarian failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H172086747\" class=\"local\">'Under age 40 years'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Taffe JR, Dennerstein L.
