Methamphetamine is most often smoked or snorted and is less commonly injected or ingested orally.</p><p>Clinical manifestations of methamphetamine use include increased energy and alertness, euphoria, sympathetic nervous system activation, decreased need for sleep, weight loss, dry mouth leading to tooth decay, and chronic adverse mood and cognitive changes, including irritability, anxiety, aggression, panic, suspiciousness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> paranoia, hallucinations, executive dysfunction, and memory impairment. Methamphetamine can also exacerbate existing psychiatric symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-use-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The psychiatric diagnoses, methamphetamine abuse and methamphetamine dependence, in DSM-IV-TR were replaced by one diagnosis, amphetamine-type substance use disorder, in DSM-5 listed under the broader category of stimulant use disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-use-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].
