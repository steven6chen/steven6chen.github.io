The urge to move the legs is worse at rest and at night and relieved by movement. RLS is commonly associated with sleep disturbance and with involuntary, jerking movements of the legs during sleep, known as periodic leg movements of sleep (PLMS). When significant sleep disturbances or impaired daytime functioning coexist with PLMS in the absence of RLS or other associated disorders, the term periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) is used.</p><p>RLS is a treatable condition that generally responds well to pharmacologic therapy. A variety of treatments have been studied in randomized, controlled trials; the major classes of drugs used include dopaminergic agents, alpha-2-delta calcium channel ligands, opioids, and benzodiazepines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. The treatment approach to PLMD is similar to that of RLS, although supported by considerably less data. (See <a href=\"#H1663989\" class=\"local\">'Periodic limb movement disorder'</a> below.)</p><p>The selection of therapy depends upon a number of factors, including disease severity, patient age, comorbidities (eg, pain, depression, anxiety, history of impulse control disorders), drug side effects, and patient preferences. The goals of therapy are to reduce or eliminate symptoms of RLS and improve daytime function, sleep, and quality of life.</p><p>This topic will review the treatment of RLS and PLMD in adults. The clinical features and diagnosis of RLS and PLMD in adults and treatment of these disorders in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1663765\"><span class=\"h1\">IRON REPLACEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A serum ferritin concentration lower than 45 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(ng/mL)</span> has been associated with an increased severity of restless legs syndrome (RLS), and iron replacement is suggested if the fasting serum ferritin level is lower than 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Iron therapy should not be prescribed empirically because it may result in iron overload, especially in patients with previously unsuspected hemochromatosis.</p><p>This recommendation is based on evidence supporting a role for iron deficiency in the pathophysiology of RLS and several small randomized placebo-controlled trials showing a clinical benefit in patients receiving iron replacement therapy: one in 18 adult patients with serum ferritin &le;75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> treated with oral iron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], one in 25 patients with end-stage renal disease and functional iron deficiency treated with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-dextran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iron dextran</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and three trials in patients with moderate to severe RLS treated with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-carboxymaltose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric carboxymaltose</a> (1000 mg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p>Two other randomized studies of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-sucrose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iron sucrose</a>, only one of which was limited to iron-deficient patients, failed to show a benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], as did a trial of lower-dose intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-carboxymaltose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric carboxymaltose</a> (500 mg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A meta-analysis that included four of the studies found significant heterogeneity in the formulation of iron used, patient characteristics, and measurement of outcome variables across studies and found insufficient evidence to conclude whether iron is beneficial for treatment of RLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Iron supplementation can be supplied orally or intravenously. Intravenous delivery has the advantage of replenishing iron stores with fewer administrations than oral therapy but it is less convenient and carries a risk of serious infusion reactions, including anaphylaxis. There are no direct comparisons of intravenous versus oral iron supplementation in patients with RLS, and available data do not show clear superiority of one route of administration over the other. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Allergic and infusion reactions'</a>.)</p><p>Because oral iron is easier to administer and safer, we suggest initial therapy with an oral regimen such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferrous sulfate</a> (325 mg orally every other day or daily). Iron should be combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a> (100 to 200 mg with each dose of ferrous sulfate) or a small glass of orange juice to enhance absorption. Iron should not be taken at the same time as calcium supplements or significant amounts of dairy products. The administration of oral iron and strategies to improve tolerability are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults#H9253776\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Dosing and administration (oral iron)'</a>.)</p><p>Intravenous iron therapy is generally reserved for patients with low iron stores and either a malabsorption state or complete intolerance to oral iron preparations. A number of intravenous iron preparations are available, with major differences in cost, <span class=\"nowrap\">formulary/purchasing</span> agreements, and number of <span class=\"nowrap\">visits/time</span> required to administer the full dose. If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-carboxymaltose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric carboxymaltose</a> is selected, trials in patients with RLS suggest that a dose of 1000 mg, not 500 mg, should be used, and that it make take up to 12 weeks to observe the maximum benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Intravenous iron'</a>.)</p><p>Ferritin levels should be checked after three to four months of therapy and then every three to six months until the serum ferritin level is &gt;75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> and iron saturation is greater than 20 percent. Monitoring is important to avoid the rare but serious complication of iron overload in patients with hemochromatosis genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

However, occasionally they occur abundantly with frequent electroencephalographic arousals in the absence of other disorders, leading the clinician to suspect that they are directly responsible for complaints of excessive sleepiness or insomnia. The term periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) should be restricted to this subgroup.</p><p>For patients with PLMS associated with RLS, treatment should concentrate on the symptoms of RLS rather than on the leg movements. For PLMS associated with other sleep disorders, independent treatment of PLMS is rarely required.</p><p>There are limited data regarding management of PLMD. Polysomnographic studies of PLMS in RLS have shown reduction in the periodic limb movement index with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pramipexole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pramipexole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropinirole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropinirole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotigotine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rotigotine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-enacarbil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin enacarbil</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/3,47,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,47,88</a>].

If there are contraindications to dopamine agonist therapy, an alpha-2-delta ligand can be tried. Dosing and safety considerations are the same as for use in RLS.

A variety of treatments for RLS have been studied in randomized controlled trials. The goals of therapy are to reduce or eliminate symptoms of RLS and improve daytime function, sleep, and quality of life.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iron stores should be evaluated in all patients with suspected or established RLS. We suggest a trial of oral iron therapy for patients with iron deficiency or low-normal ferritin levels (ie, serum ferritin level &lt;75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L)</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1663765\" class=\"local\">'Iron replacement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonpharmacologic therapy options include avoidance of aggravating drugs and substances such as caffeine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F88603\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88603 \">table 1</a>), mental alerting activities, short daily hemodialysis for patients in renal failure, exercise, leg massage, and applied heat. In patients with mild <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intermittent symptoms, these therapies may be sufficient for symptom relief. (See <a href=\"#H1663800\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with chronic persistent RLS despite nonpharmacologic therapies, we recommend pharmacologic therapy with a non-ergot dopamine agonist or an alpha-2-delta calcium channel ligand (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The choice between the two classes of drugs is based on symptom severity, patient age and comorbidities, drug side effect profiles, and patient preferences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F115818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115818 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F101364\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101364 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1935612\" class=\"local\">'Choice of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with very severe RLS, comorbid depression, or <span class=\"nowrap\">obesity/metabolic</span> syndrome, we suggest initial therapy with a dopamine agonist (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=pramipexole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pramipexole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropinirole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropinirole</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotigotine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rotigotine</a>) rather than an alpha-2-delta calcium channel ligand (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1663842\" class=\"local\">'Dopamine agonists'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with comorbid pain, anxiety, or insomnia or a history of impulse control disorder or addiction associated with use of a dopamine agonist, we suggest starting with an alpha-2-delta calcium channel ligand (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-enacarbil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin enacarbil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1663891\" class=\"local\">'Alpha-2-delta calcium channel ligands'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most other patients, we initially try an alpha-2-delta calcium channel ligand because of the risk of augmentation with dopamine agonists, but other potential side effects of the various drugs should also be considered. In general, older patients are more prone to side effects of alpha-2-delta ligands. If the first drug chosen is ineffective or poorly tolerated, then a drug of the other class should be tried.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with intermittent symptoms that are not frequent enough to require daily therapy but are nonetheless disabling when they do occur, we suggest a trial of a dopamine agonist or levodopa on an as-needed basis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Other treatment options for intermittent symptoms include benzodiazepines and opioids. (See <a href=\"#H7268502\" class=\"local\">'Intermittent symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When RLS symptoms are refractory to first-line therapy with a dopamine agonist or an alpha-2-delta calcium channel ligand, treatment options include combination therapy and opioids. (See <a href=\"#H1663961\" class=\"local\">'Refractory RLS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Augmentation, which refers to an overall worsening of RLS symptom severity, with earlier onset of symptoms, shorter symptom latency with rest, shorter duration of action of drugs, or spread of symptoms to trunk or arms, is the most common complication of long-term dopaminergic therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F109702\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109702 \">table 4</a>). Augmentation may be managed by alteration in the treatment regimen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F116031\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116031 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1663954\" class=\"local\">'Augmentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RLS is common during pregnancy. Many patients can be managed successfully with education, reassurance, iron supplementation if indicated, and nonpharmacologic strategies. Pharmacologic therapies such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-and-levodopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa-levodopa</a> may be considered for severe symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=restless-legs-syndrome-during-pregnancy-and-lactation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Restless legs syndrome during pregnancy and lactation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) as an entity distinct from RLS is not well studied, but the approach is similar to that of RLS. Periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS) in the absence of insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness do not require treatment.
