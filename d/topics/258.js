Although uncomplicated cystitis may occur in children younger than two years, it is difficult to differentiate upper from lower urinary tract infection (UTI) in such children, and they are usually assumed to have upper UTI. Uncomplicated cystitis usually is caused by pathogens that are susceptible to commonly used antimicrobial agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Complicated cystitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complicated cystitis is defined by coexisting upper UTI, multiple-drug resistant uropathogens, or hosts with special considerations (eg, anatomic or physiologic abnormality of the urinary tract, indwelling bladder catheter, malignancy, diabetes). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of bladder dysfunction in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179705461\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the normal host, most uropathogens originate in the gastrointestinal tract, migrate to the periurethral area and the urethra, and ascend to the bladder, where they stimulate a host response. Bacterial adhesins (pili) and other virulence factors, such as hemolysin and flagellae, provide a selective advantage. Patients who have urodynamic dysfunction, neurogenic bladder, or incomplete bladder emptying may harbor pathogens in residual urine, creating a source for persistent or recurrent infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-adherence-and-other-virulence-factors-for-urinary-tract-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial adherence and other virulence factors for urinary tract infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (UTIs) involves ascension of organisms along a biofilm on intraluminal or extraluminal surface of the catheter. Failure to maintain the integrity of a closed urinary catheter system provides access for organisms to enter the bladder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of acute cystitis in children is difficult to determine because most epidemiologic studies include children with both upper and lower urinary tract infection (UTI). In pooled analysis of four studies that included children younger than 19 years (most of whom were older than two years) and had urinary symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fever, the prevalence of UTI was 7.8 percent (95% CI 6.6-8.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cystitis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-older-than-two-years-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; no distinction was made between upper and lower tract disease, and sexual activity was not assessed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H445559890\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for acute cystitis in children and adolescents include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female sex &ndash; Urinary tract infections (UTI), including acute cystitis, are more common among girls than boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cystitis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-older-than-two-years-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].
