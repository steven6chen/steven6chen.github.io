VTE has significant morbidity and mortality for both the inpatient and outpatient population. The risk of recurrent thrombosis and embolization is highest in the first few days and weeks following diagnosis. Thus, initial anticoagulation during the first few days (ie, 0 to 10 days) is critical in the prevention of recurrence and VTE-related death.</p><p>The agents used, timing, duration, and dosing of initial anticoagulation for the treatment of VTE are discussed in this topic. The indications and overview of VTE treatment, as well as long-term (3 to 12 months) and extended (indefinite) anticoagulation for patients with VTE are discussed separately.

Long-term anticoagulant therapy is typically administered for a finite period beyond the initial period, usually three to six months and occasionally up to 12 months. Extended anticoagulation usually refers to therapy that is administered indefinitely.

Throughout this topic we refer to these agents by their pharmacologic class, factor Xa and direct thrombin inhibitors.

Similarly, patients with symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) and most patients with subsegmental PE should be anticoagulated. For each patient, the decision to anticoagulate must weigh the risk of morbidity and mortality without anticoagulation against the risk of bleeding on anticoagulation. Details of the indications for anticoagulation, including those for patients with isolated distal DVT and subsegmental PE are discussed separately.

Most clinicians agree that patients with a three-month bleeding risk less than 2 percent (low risk) should be anticoagulated and that those with a bleeding risk more than 13 percent (high risk) should not be anticoagulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-thromboembolism-initiation-of-anticoagulation-first-10-days/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For patients with a bleeding risk between these values (moderate risk), there is no agreement regarding the preferred approach such that the decision to anticoagulate in this population must be individualized according to the values and preferences of the patient as well as the risk-benefit ratio. Risk factors for bleeding that influence whether or not to anticoagulate are discussed in detail separately.
