Sinusitis is a condition that causes a stuffy nose, pain in the face, and discharge (mucus) from the nose.</p><p>The sinuses are hollow areas in the bones of the face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75045 \">figure 1</a>). They have a thin lining that normally makes a small amount of mucus. When this lining gets inflamed, it swells and makes extra mucus.</p><p>The most common type of sinusitis often happens after you catch a cold. It is also called &quot;acute sinusitis&quot; and usually gets better in 1 to 3 weeks. Chronic sinusitis lasts for at least 3 months. People with this condition often have very swollen sinuses. One or more sinuses might get filled with infected mucus. Some people get abnormal growths inside their noses or sinuses, called &quot;polyps&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64506\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64506 \">figure 2</a>). People with nasal polyps often have a poor sense of smell.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H554932391\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of chronic sinusitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include having at least 2 of the following symptoms for at least 3 months:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A stuffy nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Yellow, green, or brown mucus that drains from the nose or down the back of the throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain, pressure, or a feeling of &quot;fullness&quot; in the face</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not being able to smell things as well as usual</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H554932421\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have at least 2 of the above symptoms for more than 3 months, see your doctor or nurse. He or she can help figure out if you have chronic sinusitis.</p><p>Call your doctor or nurse <strong>right away</strong> if you have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever higher than 102.5&deg;F (39.2&deg;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden and severe pain in the face and head</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble seeing or seeing double</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling or redness around 1 or both eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A very bad headache or stiff neck</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64091283\"><span class=\"h1\">Are some people more likely to get chronic sinusitis than others?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You might be more likely to get chronic sinusitis if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have allergies &ndash; Allergies to molds, cockroaches, dust mites (tiny insects found in dust), and animal dander (tiny flakes from animal fur, hair, or skin) are most likely to cause sinus problems. (Things that cause allergies, such as pollen and mold, are called &quot;allergens.&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have problems with your body's infection-fighting system (called the &quot;immune system&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get frequent colds</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have an injury or deformity of the nose that makes it hard to drain mucus normally</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoke cigarettes or are around others who smoke</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H554932436\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests for chronic sinusitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, but they are not always needed. Tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT scan or other imaging tests &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the sinuses. These tests are not usually done in children unless they do not get better with treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test to look inside the sinuses &ndash; For this test, a doctor puts a thin tube with a camera on the end into the nose and up into the sinuses.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H554932451\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you smoke, quit. If you have allergies, talk to your doctor about how to better control your allergy symptoms.</p><p>You can also rinse out your nose with salt water. This cleans the inside of your nose and washes allergens and mucus from the nose. Different devices can be used to rinse the nose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H554932466\"><span class=\"h1\">How is chronic sinusitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor might recommend different treatments, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroids &ndash; These medicines help to reduce swelling and mucus, and shrink polyps, if you have them. (These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.) They can be taken as sprays or drops that you put in your nose. You can also add steroid medicines to the salt water you use for rinsing out your nose. Your doctor also might prescribe steroid pills.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics &ndash; These are used to treat sinus infections, which sometimes happen when you have chronic sinusitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Some people with chronic sinusitis need surgery to reopen blocked nasal passages and remove polyps or mucus trapped in the nose. But this is usually done only in people who do not get better after trying medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H554932481\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinusitis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sinusitis in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rinsing-out-your-nose-with-salt-water-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rinsing out your nose with salt water (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-sinusitis-sinus-infection-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acute sinusitis (sinus infection) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic rhinosinusitis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
