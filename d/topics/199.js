We now use TTP to refer to the thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) caused by severely reduced activity of the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease ADAMTS13. We divide TTP into acquired and hereditary syndromes, due to an autoantibody against ADAMTS13 and ADAMTS13 gene mutations, respectively. TTP is characterized by small-vessel platelet-rich thrombi, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. In addition, some patients may have neurologic abnormalities, mild renal insufficiency, and low-grade fever.</p><p>Acquired autoimmune TTP is a medical emergency that is almost always fatal if appropriate treatment is not initiated promptly; with appropriate treatment, survival rates of up to 90 percent are possible.</p><p>This topic reviews our approach to the initial therapy for children and adults with acquired (autoimmune) TTP, defined by severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (activity level usually &lt;10 percent) caused by an autoantibody.</p><p>The following aspects of care for individuals with acquired TTP are discussed in detail separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations and diagnosis &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management during recovery from the acute episode &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-management-following-recovery-from-an-acute-episode-and-during-remission\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Management following recovery from an acute episode and during remission&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapy refractory or relapsed disease &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-treatment-of-refractory-or-relapsed-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Treatment of refractory or relapsed disease&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>The evaluation and management of other primary TMAs (including HUS) is also presented separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overview of approach to the classification and initial evaluation &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with suspected TTP, HUS, or other thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hereditary TTP (due to inherited biallelic <em>ADAMTS13</em> mutation) &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug-induced TMA (DITMA), also sometimes referred to as drug-induced TTP &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-thrombotic-microangiopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced thrombotic microangiopathy&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complement-mediated TMA, also sometimes called complement-mediated HUS and commonly referred to as &quot;atypical HUS&quot; &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrheal hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-in-children#H12590674\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemolytic uremic syndrome in children&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy-associated syndromes (eg, hemolysis, elevated liver function tests, and low platelets [HELLP] syndrome, preeclampsia) &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hellp-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HELLP syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Preeclampsia with severe features/HELLP'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H322016\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Terminology for TTP and related conditions has evolved as the etiology of these syndromes becomes clearer. We use the following terminology to refer to TTP and related syndromes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)</strong> &ndash; TMA describes a pathologic lesion in which abnormalities in the vessel wall of arterioles and capillaries lead to microvascular thrombosis. The major hematologic findings are thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolysis. TMA is a pathologic diagnosis, but its presence is commonly inferred from the observation of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolysis in the appropriate clinical setting. Several primary TMA syndromes have been described, of which TTP is one; these differ in their mechanisms, clinical presentations, and management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma#H958404\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with suspected TTP, HUS, or other thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)&quot;, section on 'Overview of primary TMA syndromes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acquired TTP</strong> &ndash; Acquired TTP refers to the TMA caused by autoantibodies to the von Willebrand factor protease ADAMTS13. These autoantibodies result in ADAMTS13 deficiency. However, the diagnosis is made clinically because ADAMTS13 activity testing does not have adequate sensitivity or specificity to be used in isolation, and the turnaround time for this testing is too slow to incorporate the information into immediate management decisions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Outcomes of acquired TTP</strong> &ndash; The following definitions apply to the clinical course of acquired TTP with treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-initial-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Response</strong> &ndash; Normalization of the platelet count with plasma exchange therapy (PEX); in some patients the platelet count may return to a stable level below <span class=\"nowrap\">150,000/microL</span> if there are conditions contributing to thrombocytopenia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Exacerbation</strong> &ndash; Recurrent thrombocytopenia within 30 days of stopping PEX.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Remission</strong> &ndash; Maintenance of a normal platelet count for 30 days after stopping PEX.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Relapse</strong> &ndash; Recurrence of TTP following remission.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hereditary TTP</strong> &ndash; Hereditary TTP refers to the TMA caused by biallelic ADAMTS13 mutations. These mutations result in severe ADAMTS13 deficiency that may present in childhood or adulthood (eg, during pregnancy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Drug-induced TMA</strong> &ndash; Drug-induced TMA (DITMA) refers to a TMA caused by exposure to a medication or other substance such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a>. This condition is referred to by some as drug-induced TTP, but we prefer to avoid this term since drug-induced TMA is not associated with severe reductions in ADAMTS13 activity and is not treated with modalities directed at correcting such a deficiency (eg, DITMA is not treated with plasma exchange). We consider cases of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency to be TTP rather than DITMA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-thrombotic-microangiopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced thrombotic microangiopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ST-HUS</strong> &ndash; Shiga toxin-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome (ST-HUS) refers to a TMA caused by Shiga toxin, which is produced by diarrheal organisms (eg, some serotypes of <em>Escherichia coli</em>, such as O157:H7 and O104:H4; <em>Shigella dysenteriae</em>) that is acquired from exposure to farms or improperly prepared foods. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-shiga-toxin-producing-escherichia-coli-stec-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-hus-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complement-mediated TMA</strong> &ndash; Complement-mediated TMA (also called complement-mediated HUS and sometimes referred to as atypical HUS) is the TMA caused by dysregulation of the complement system. Typically, factors that keep the alternative pathway of complement in check are impaired, resulting in excessive complement activation. Acquired and hereditary forms are seen. We avoid the term &quot;atypical HUS&quot; for these syndromes because this is a vague term that was used to describe non-diarrheal HUS in children before the multiple etiologies of non-diarrheal TMA were identified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Where possible, we no longer use the term TTP-HUS to refer to the primary TMA syndromes, because the terminology presented above facilitates more accurate diagnosis and more appropriate therapy based on the specific underlying cause of the TMA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H494464\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF OUR APPROACH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H837511\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview for TTP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Untreated, TTP typically follows a progressive course in which neurologic deterioration, cardiac ischemia, irreversible renal failure, and death are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-initial-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The mortality rate prior to the 1980s, when effective therapy became available, was approximately 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-initial-treatment/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Prompt, effective treatment is essential for survival.</p><p>The mainstay of treatment for TTP is plasma exchange therapy (PEX; also called therapeutic plasma exchange [TPE]), which has converted TTP from a condition with a 90 percent mortality rate to one in which more than 80 percent of patients recover [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-initial-treatment/abstract/3-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-9</a>]. Subsequently, the addition of glucocorticoids to PEX and the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> have further improved outcomes while decreasing the required duration of PEX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-initial-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Although PEX can be life-saving, there are several challenges in its use. The first is in deciding whether to initiate PEX because the diagnosis of TTP is made using a combination of clinical and laboratory features. Results of ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitor testing often are not immediately available, and even when they are available, they cannot be used in isolation because they are not sufficiently sensitive or specific for diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Reduced ADAMTS13 activity'</a>.)</p><p>PEX also carries substantial risks, and its use requires the mobilization of individuals with expertise in managing the procedure and operating the apheresis equipment, and in some cases transfer of the patient to another facility. Additionally, use of PEX should not take the place of other treatments directed at other causes of the patient's clinical findings such as complement blockade for complement-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) or antibiotics for sepsis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with suspected TTP, HUS, or other thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)&quot;</a>). Other challenges include when to add additional therapies and when to discontinue PEX when a response occurs, or when there is no response and another etiology for MAHA and thrombocytopenia seems likely.</p><p>Our general approach is as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F101761\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101761 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For any patient with a presumptive diagnosis of acquired TTP, we recommend urgent initiation of PEX therapy, together with glucocorticoids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>; this should not be delayed while awaiting results of diagnostic testing. Transfer to a facility capable of performing PEX may be necessary. Early involvement of the consulting clinician with expertise in managing TTP is advised. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Initiation of PEX for a presumptive diagnosis of TTP'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Plasma infusion may be used as a temporizing measure while arranging for PEX, but it is not an alternative to PEX and should not delay initiation of PEX. (See <a href=\"#H501252\" class=\"local\">'Plasma infusion as a temporizing measure'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We give glucocorticoids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> to all patients. This represents a change from our previous approach, which has evolved over time. In the past, we reserved rituximab for selected individuals with severe, refractory, or relapsed disease. We use rituximab as part of initial therapy in all patients whose diagnosis is supported by ADAMTS13 activity &lt;10 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who have clinical features that support the diagnosis of TTP, or unless there is a contraindication. This practice is based on emerging evidence that rituximab reduces the risk of exacerbation and relapse and may hasten response to therapy. (See <a href=\"#H495807\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> below and <a href=\"#H495813\" class=\"local\">'Rituximab'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with increasing platelet count during PEX, one of the authors (JNG) continues PEX, glucocorticoids, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> until the platelet count is normal <span class=\"nowrap\">(&ge;150,000/microL)</span> for at least two days. The other author (AC) continues PEX until the platelet count reaches a stable plateau in the normal or supranormal range for three days, based on the premise that a platelet count of <span class=\"nowrap\">150,000/microL</span> may not be &quot;normal&quot; for all patients. PEX is discontinued with additional observation, after which the central venous catheter is removed and glucocorticoids are tapered. Glucocorticoids and rituximab dosing and discontinuation are discussed below.

Thus, therapy is initiated in a patient with thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) without an apparent alternative etiology, who has acquired TTP until proven otherwise. For such patients, we recommend prompt initiation of plasma exchange (PEX) therapy rather than plasma infusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunosuppressive therapy alone. Therapy should not be delayed while awaiting the results of ADAMTS13 activity levels or inhibitor testing. Although some have suggested that the decision to initiate PEX should be based solely on ADAMTS13 activity, we believe that treatment decisions should be based primarily on clinical criteria (eg, MAHA, thrombocytopenia, neurologic symptoms, lack of an apparent alternative etiology), with ADAMTS13 activity used as supportive evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-initial-treatment/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>The consulting specialist can assist in determining the possibility of another underlying cause of the patient&rsquo;s symptoms and laboratory abnormalities, facilitate proper testing and initiation of PEX, and assist in identifying a medical center capable of performing PEX if necessary. Additional discussion of features that support a presumptive diagnosis of TTP (or make a presumptive diagnosis of TTP less likely) is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3712217\"><span class=\"h2\">Evidence for efficacy of PEX</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of urgent PEX for presumptive diagnosis of TTP is based on the documented high mortality of TTP without plasma exchange and high quality evidence supporting the use of PEX that was accumulated before routine measurement of ADAMTS13 activity was available. As an example, in a series of 255 patients, three-quarters died within three months; many of those who survived were subsequently diagnosed with another condition such as meningococcal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-initial-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The efficacy of PEX was established in two landmark clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-initial-treatment/abstract/3,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial and seminal trial, published in 1991, randomly assigned 102 patients with TTP (defined as MAHA and thrombocytopenia without another identifiable cause) to receive either PEX or plasma infusion for seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-initial-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. All patients also received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dipyridamole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dipyridamole</a>, adjunctive treatments that are no longer used. Glucocorticoids were not standard treatment when this clinical trial was performed. Survival was greater in those assigned to PEX than those assigned to plasma infusion at nine days (96 versus 84 percent) and at six months (78 versus 63 percent). Response rates, defined by an increase in platelet count, were also higher with PEX than plasma infusion, both at nine days (47 versus 25 percent) and six months (78 versus 49 percent). The real benefit may be greater because patients whose disease did not respond were able to cross over to receive PEX. At six months, the 31 patients who were treated initially with plasma infusion and were able to cross over to receive PEX had a survival rate of 71 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second study, also published in 1991, treated 108 patients with TTP (defined by four out of five clinical findings [MAHA, thrombocytopenia, fever, renal dysfunction, central nervous system abnormalities]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-initial-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Half of the patients presented with rapid clinical deterioration and received urgent PEX plus glucocorticoids. Half of the patients were clinically stable, without neurologic abnormalities, and received glucocorticoids alone (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>, 200 mg daily); of these, 24 (44 percent) had no response and were then treated with PEX plus glucocorticoids. Of the 78 patients who ultimately received PEX, most responded; following recovery, they were treated with plasma infusion that was tapered over eight days. Exacerbations (referred to as &quot;relapses&quot;) occurred in 69 patients (64 percent); most of these occurred within 30 days of diagnosis and would be classified as refractory disease by subsequently developed criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-initial-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There were 10 deaths, nine of which occurred within four days of diagnosis (overall survival, 91 percent).</p><p/><p>Multiple subsequent studies have confirmed the efficacy of PEX in TTP, as defined by various criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-initial-treatment/abstract/1,9,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,14,15</a>]. Our interpretation of the accumulated evidence is that PEX is highly effective in individuals with acquired autoimmune TTP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-initial-treatment/abstract/3-5,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,16</a>]. Some individuals without documented ADAMTS13 deficiency also respond to PEX; some of these patients may have conditions other than TTP, which respond to a simultaneous intervention rather than PEX (eg, resolution of drug-induced thrombotic microangiopathy [DITMA] upon drug discontinuation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-initial-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, some patients with complement-mediated TMA may respond to PEX. If the diagnosis of TTP is uncertain but sufficiently likely to warrant the risks of PEX and the potential survival benefit, we initiate PEX and discontinue it subsequently if an alternative diagnosis is discovered, such as a systemic infection or malignancy, DITMA, or documented Shiga toxin-mediated TMA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F101761\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101761 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-initial-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H404188\"><span class=\"h2\">Plasma exchange procedure</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92432337\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview of procedure and plasma products</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PEX involves removal of the patient&rsquo;s plasma by apheresis and replacement with donor plasma. In TTP, this is assumed to work by replacing ADAMTS13 and removing the autoantibodies that are inhibiting ADAMTS13 activity as well as any residual ultralarge VWF multimers. Correcting ADAMTS13 deficiency in turn restores proper cleavage of ultralarge von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers, prevents microvascular thrombosis, and reverses symptoms of organ damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-initial-treatment/abstract/3,13,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13,16,17</a>].

Rarely, a patient will be able to undergo PEX via peripheral venous access, which avoids potential complications of the central venous catheter. We generally try to avoid use of a femoral catheter due to increased infectious risks; however, these risks are considered acceptable for a short period of time (eg, less than five to seven days) if a catheter is urgently required when a specialist is not available to place a central venous catheter. Additional strategies to minimize catheter complications such as the use of ultrasound guidance are presented separately.

We stop PEX once recovery occurs; we do not taper. Usually, at this time, the hemolysis has also resolved or substantially improved, although schistocytes may remain present (see <a href=\"#H3711571\" class=\"local\">'Expected time-course of recovery'</a> below). Also, the serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration has become normal or nearly normal, though this can be influenced by removal of LDH with PEX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-initial-treatment/abstract/5,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,35</a>].

We adjust the timing such that the rituximab dose is given soon after PEX, rather than before, to minimize this effect. However, if rituximab is inadvertently given immediately before the PEX procedure is due, we do not delay PEX because it is the primary therapy for halting disease activity. Rituximab is effective when given with PEX, possibly because the conventional dose of 375 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> is more than is needed for an autoimmune disorder.

Plasma infusion does not remove the inhibitor (autoantibody) to ADAMTS13, and the volume of plasma (and thus the amount of ADAMTS13) that can be delivered is significantly less than in PEX. This was illustrated in the landmark trial that compared plasma infusion with PEX, in which those undergoing infusion received an average of approximately 7 liters of plasma, compared with approximately 22 liters in those undergoing PEX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-initial-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>However, PEX may not be immediately available to all patients, and plasma infusion may provide temporary benefit in some patients. This was illustrated by a retrospective analysis of 57 patients who received plasma infusion (25 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day) versus PEX, in which infusion was inferior to PEX but was effective in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-initial-treatment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Adverse events were also greater in the infusion group; six were unable to tolerate the volume of plasma infused and were switched to PEX. Another retrospective review of 20 patients found that plasma infusion had similar efficacy to PEX if equivalent volumes of plasma were administered; however, this may not be feasible in the majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-initial-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Thus, for patients with an expected delay in initiating PEX (eg, more than six hours), we use infusion of donor plasma as long as it does not interfere with or delay the appropriate institution of PEX.

The rationale is that the potential benefits in reducing inhibitor production and number of required plasma exchanges outweigh the risks, which are relatively minor for the limited duration of therapy given. Glucocorticoids are thought to reduce production of the ADAMTS13 inhibitor (autoantibody) by mechanisms similar to those in other autoimmune diseases. Other effects such as reduced cytokine production or decreased autoantibody-mediated clearance of ADAMTS13 may also contribute to the efficacy of glucocorticoids.</p><p>The dose and route of glucocorticoid administered may vary according to the severity of presentation.

In the past, we reserved rituximab for selected patients with severe, refractory, or relapsed disease. When confidence in the diagnosis of acquired TTP is high, we do not wait for the results of ADAMTS13 testing before starting rituximab. Rituximab may be delayed until results of ADAMTS13 testing are available in selected individuals (eg, lower confidence in the diagnosis of acquired TTP, greater risk of adverse events from rituximab); it is not clear whether a delay adversely affects the efficacy of rituximab in TTP.

Although some have suggested decisions based solely on ADAMTS13 activity, we believe that treatment decisions should be based primarily on clinical criteria (eg, neurologic symptoms, platelet count) with ADAMTS13 activity used as supportive evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-initial-treatment/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

This reduces the number of days the central venous catheter is in place, which thereby reduces the risks of catheter-related infections and reduces the total amount of donor plasma exposure.</p><p>We continue glucocorticoid treatment (typically <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily) at full dose for an additional five to seven days and then taper the dose over two to three weeks.

As noted above, the timing of PEX and rituximab should be adjusted to allow the maximum interval between rituximab administration and the next daily PEX procedure.

If the patient will accept plasma derivatives, factor VIII concentrates containing sufficient amounts of ADAMTS13 (eg, Koate-DVI) may be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-initial-treatment/abstract/60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-62</a>].

For patients with a presumptive diagnosis of TTP (eg, thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia [MAHA] without an obvious underlying cause), we recommend prompt initiation of plasma exchange (PEX) therapy rather than plasma infusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunosuppressive therapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Therapy should not be delayed while awaiting the results of ADAMTS13 activity levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F101761\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101761 \">algorithm 1</a>). Early involvement of the consulting specialist is advised to assist in decision making, testing, and facilitating urgent initiation of PEX. (See <a href=\"#H494464\" class=\"local\">'Overview of our approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Initiation of PEX for a presumptive diagnosis of TTP'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>PEX is performed daily. The choice of replacement plasma (eg, Fresh Frozen Plasma [FFP], <span class=\"nowrap\">Solvent/Detergent</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">[S/D]</span> Plasma) is determined by the physicians overseeing the procedure. PEX therapy almost always requires a central venous catheter with a large bore and two lumens. (See <a href=\"#H404188\" class=\"local\">'Plasma exchange procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Plasma infusion is not an adequate substitute for PEX in the initial treatment of TTP, and plasma infusion should not delay initiation of PEX. However, we use plasma infusion as a temporizing measure if an unavoidable delay in PEX is expected. (See <a href=\"#H501252\" class=\"local\">'Plasma infusion as a temporizing measure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a presumptive diagnosis of acquired TTP, we suggest administration of a glucocorticoid (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). A typical regimen is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day orally or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> 125 mg two to four times daily intravenously. (See <a href=\"#H495807\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a presumptive diagnosis of acquired TTP, we suggest administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This is based on accumulating evidence that rituximab may reduce the risks of exacerbation and relapse and may hasten response to therapy. We use a dose of 375 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> weekly for four weeks; lower doses may be equally effective. Some experts may reasonably omit rituximab due to concerns about toxicity, pending additional data on outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H495813\" class=\"local\">'Rituximab'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals whose platelet count responds receive continued PEX and glucocorticoids until platelet count recovery as defined above (see <a href=\"#H404644\" class=\"local\">'Volume and schedule'</a> above), at which time PEX is discontinued. Additional monitoring is used to confirm disease response, after which the central venous catheter is removed and glucocorticoids are tapered rapidly. (See <a href=\"#H3712582\" class=\"local\">'Platelet count increasing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There may be several possible explanations for lack of a platelet count increase within the first several days of therapy. In many cases, a change in management is required, either to intensify therapy or to treat another condition that is found to be the initial cause of MAHA and thrombocytopenia (eg, another primary thrombotic microangiopathy [TMA], infection, malignancy) or that has developed during initial therapy (eg, central venous catheter infection). (See <a href=\"#H3958687\" class=\"local\">'Platelet count not increasing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of PEX include those related to the central venous catheter and those related to donor plasma exposure (eg, allergic reactions, transfusion-related acute lung injury). Major complications of PEX occur in approximately one-quarter of individuals undergoing PEX for acquired TTP. (See <a href=\"#H3711878\" class=\"local\">'PEX complications'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic apheresis (plasma exchange or cytapheresis): Complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not use routine prophylactic platelet transfusions in TTP. However, appropriate transfusions should not be withheld if needed for the treatment of bleeding or an invasive procedure. (See <a href=\"#H495876\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding/platelet transfusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acquired TTP during pregnancy (or postpartum) is treated with PEX. Delivery does not cause resolution of TTP, and premature delivery should be considered only for obstetric indications such as the presence of severe preeclampsia. (See <a href=\"#H1901751\" class=\"local\">'Acquired TTP during pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management following recovery from the acute episode of acquired TTP, and treatment of refractory and relapsed disease are presented separately.
