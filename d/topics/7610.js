Physiologic GER typically is a developmental process that resolves with maturation. GER generally resolves on its own by one year of age. In infants who have no symptoms other than regurgitation, no further evaluation or intervention is typically required. </p><p>In contrast, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is clinically significant GER that causes morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Putative morbidities of GERD in preterm infants include frequent vomiting, aspiration pneumonia, irritability, failure to thrive, and exacerbation of respiratory symptoms, including chronic lung disease. However, it is likely that in many infants with these symptoms, the GER is not the underlying cause.</p><p>GER in preterm infants will be reviewed here. GER in infants, children, and adolescents are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroesophageal-reflux-in-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroesophageal reflux in infants&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GER is extremely common in healthy infants in whom gastric fluids reflux into the esophagus 30 or more times daily. It appears that GER is more common in healthy preterm compared with term infants. The pathogenesis of GER in preterm infants appears to be multifactorial due in part to immature or impaired anatomic and physiologic factors that typically limit reflux.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Relaxation of lower esophageal sphincter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important mechanism of GER in preterm infants (similar to older infants and adults) is transient relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The LES is comprised of intrinsic smooth muscle of the esophagus and skeletal muscle of the crural diaphragm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Transient LES relaxation is defined as an abrupt decrease in LES pressure below the intragastric pressure, which is unrelated to swallowing and allows regurgitation of stomach contents into the esophagus. Normally, the LES relaxes with the onset of esophageal contractions triggered by swallowing as food passes down the esophagus, and contracts when swallowing ceases in order to prevent reflux by maintaining a lower esophageal pressure that is higher than the intragastric pressure.</p><p>The frequency of transient LES relaxation is the same in preterm infants with and without GER disease (GERD). However, infants with GERD are more likely to experience acid regurgitation during LES relaxation than those without GERD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastric emptying</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premature infants have slower gastric emptying compared with mature newborns. This was illustrated in a study of preterm infants born between 25 to 30 weeks gestation that demonstrated emptying time decreased linearly with advancing gestational age at birth when emptying time was measured by breath tests using isotope labeled feeds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The delay in gastric emptying in preterm infants may provide a greater gastric volume of liquid available for reflux. However, there are no data that show a delay in gastric emptying in preterm infants with symptomatic GER compared with asymptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Esophageal motility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the preterm infant, esophageal motility may be immature and contribute to GER [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In one study that evaluated esophageal function during swallowing, increasing gestational age was correlated with increasing completion of secondary esophageal peristalsis, shortening of proximal esophageal sphincter contraction, and faster propagation velocity for liquids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Another study that utilized high-resolution manometry confirmed that preterm compared with term infants were more likely to have incomplete esophageal peristalsis during swallowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Differences in swallow propagation during active sleep between preterm and term infants have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, there are no data showing differences in motility maturation directly correlating with an increased risk of symptomatic GER in preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GER may occur more frequently in infants who have respiratory disorders, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). One possible mechanism contributing to increased reflux in infants with respiratory disorders may be that increased work of breathing results in a relative increase of intraabdominal versus intrathoracic pressures, which facilitates GER.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastric tube</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of nasogastric or orogastric tubes, which are commonly used in preterm infants, may increase GER because they may cause greater LES relaxation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreased gastric emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">General symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the nonspecific nature of the symptoms associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), there is a wide variation among clinicians regarding their beliefs about the presenting signs and symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Signs or symptoms that are often attributed to gastroesophageal reflux (GER) include irritability, nonspecific behaviors suggesting discomfort such as posturing or grimacing, frequent bouts of emesis, worsening of lung disease, and failure to thrive. However, it is likely that in many cases the GER is not the underlying cause of these symptoms, as outlined in the following sections. </p><p>GER episodes tend to occur more frequently after feeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Reflux that occurs after feeds tends to be less acidic and rises higher in the esophagus compared with reflux episodes that are not temporally related to feeds.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1936014757\"><span class=\"h2\">Relationship to apnea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accumulating evidence suggests that GER is not a common trigger or mechanism for pathologic apnea of prematurity, although in selected cases a causal relationship may exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The possibility of a causal association was suggested in the past because several studies performed in the 1970s and 1980s linked GER with apnea or respiratory arrest in neonates born at term and in older infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. A proposed mechanism is that GER elicits reflexes that protect the airway and interrupt normal respiratory patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. As an example, evidence from animal models demonstrated fluid stimulation of the laryngeal mucosa inhibited normal respiratory patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>However, subsequent studies in preterm infants have mostly failed to demonstrate a temporal relationship between GER and apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/21-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-28</a>]. The lack of a temporal relationship between these two conditions has been demonstrated in studies that utilized cardiorespiratory monitoring, including respiratory inductance plethysmography, heart rate monitoring, oxygen saturation, and esophageal pH testing to detect acidic GER [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. This is illustrated by the following studies: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 119 premature infants with a mean gestational age of 28 weeks used 12-hour cardiorespiratory monitoring to record 6255 acidic GER episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Apnea &ge;15 seconds was associated with only 1 percent of the GER episodes. There was no difference in the rate of apnea &ge;15 seconds before, during, or after GER episodes. GER did not prolong apnea duration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were shown in a subsequent study from the same tertiary center, in which less than 3 percent of all cardiorespiratory events (defined as apnea &ge;10 seconds in duration, bradycardia &le;80 beats per minute, and oxygen desaturation &le;85 percent) were preceded by GER [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. GER did not increase the duration or severity of the event.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies measuring non-acidic GER using multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII) monitors have mixed results, but generally suggest that a minority of events cause apnea. In most studies, there was no association between respiratory pauses and reflux episodes in the majority of infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], although there may be a modest temporal association in certain infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. </p><p/><p>A few studies suggest that apnea may precipitate GER, rather than the opposite relationship of GER causing apnea. As an example, motility studies in premature infants (postmenstrual age range from 34 to 37 weeks) demonstrated that apneic episodes were associated with a reduction in LES tone, which is the key mechanism for GER (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Relaxation of lower esophageal sphincter'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Similar results have been reported in a study of newborn piglets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchopulmonary dysplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is unclear whether there is a causal relationship between GER and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The proposed mechanism is that GER may contribute to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia due to aspiration of gastric contents into the lungs. The possibility of a causal relationship was supported by one study that demonstrated an increased pepsin concentration in the tracheal aspirates of preterm infants who develop BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Another retrospective study reported an association between BPD and a diagnosis of GER among very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (birth weight &lt;1500 g) at one year adjusted age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, this finding may be biased because of the possible greater diagnostic suspicion for GERD among infants with BPD, resulting in a more thorough reflux investigation in this group of infants. In contrast, several other studies did not find an association between GER and BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Failure to thrive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although GER is common in infants with failure to thrive, there is little evidence that the association is causal. In a small match-controlled retrospective study of 23 preterm infants with clinically significant GER, there were no differences in the average weekly weight gain, caloric intake, and growth parameters between patients and matched controls. However, infants with GER took longer to achieve full oral feedings (32 versus 19 days) and had a longer length of hospital stay (99 versus 70 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of GERD is challenging in preterm infants because symptoms are nonspecific, and diagnostic testing is limited due to technical problems and difficulties of interpreting results in the newborn. In most cases, the diagnosis rests on the clinician's clinical suspicion that a pathological problem in an individual infant is likely to be caused by GER, based on a global assessment and exclusion of other causes of the symptoms. Because the pathological problems of poor growth, apnea of prematurity, or chronic lung disease probably not caused by GER in the majority of infants, invasive testing for GER usually is not appropriate except in selected cases. </p><p>Because of the limitations of diagnostic testing, an empiric time-limited trial of acid suppression is sometimes used for selected infants for whom there is a strong clinical suspicion that GER is causing complications, and if nonpharmacologic measures have failed. However, it should be recognized that such empiric trials are rarely definitive because of the nonspecific nature of the symptoms attributed to GER, and because GER typically improves as the infant matures (see <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> below). For all other infants with GER, nonpharmacologic management should be the mainstay of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">History and examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nonspecific signs associated with GER include regurgitation of milk, vomiting, irritability, arching, grimacing, desaturation, and respiratory symptoms. In contrast, bilious vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding, diarrhea, constipation, fever, lethargy, abdominal tenderness and distension, hepatosplenomegaly or the presence of blood in the stools suggest a diagnosis other than GER [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tests that are sometimes used in the evaluation of GER include esophageal pH probe and multiple intraluminal impedance. The diagnostic value of both of these tests is limited due to difficulties of interpreting results, especially in the newborn. Clinical testing using esophageal monitoring can document the presence of GER, but rarely establishes a causal association between GER and pathologic consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>In addition, the postconceptional age at which preterm infants can safely undergo procedures may be a limiting factor for diagnostic testing. Small, medically unstable infants may not be able to tolerate being transported for radiologic testing, or placement of a pH or multiple intraluminal impedance probe in the nostril because it may compromise respiratory status or increase the risk of esophageal perforation from probe placement in the smallest infants, although this has not been reported in the literature. The size at which the diagnostic procedures may be safely accomplished will depend on institutional comfort and familiarity. In our institution, for instance, we rarely place a multiple intraluminal impedance probe, which is stiffer than a pH probe, in infants with a weight less than 1600 g.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Esophageal pH probe</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Esophageal pH measurement to detect reflux of acidic gastric contents in the distal esophagus is the most widely employed diagnostic test for GER in preterm infants. The test, which may last up to 24 hours, is performed by the transnasal passage of a microelectrode containing a pH sensor into the lower third of the esophagus. The wide spectrum of size of preterm infants makes placement of the catheter challenging. However, placement is crucial, as misplacement may result in under- or overestimation of acid reflux, especially in the smallest infants in whom a small error in positioning could give rise to a potentially large error in the results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The catheter is placed using the Strobel formula that correlates the patient's length to <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> esophageal length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Placement is confirmed radiographically.</p><p>Various scoring techniques have been used to interpret the results of pH probe studies, and generally include the number of acid reflux episodes, average duration of the episodes, and overall proportion of time with a pH less than four. The reflux index (RI), which consists of the sum of the periods in which pH is less than four as a percent of recording time, is a widely used scoring system. Data from term infants referred for screening for an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome reported that the 95th percentile for RI was about 10 percent, and the 50th percentile was in the 4 to 5 percent range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. It is important to note that acid may not be detected postprandially in infants because milk will buffer acid contained in the refluxate, leading to underestimation of GER.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Intraluminal impedance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This newer technique, also known as multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII), uses an esophageal catheter designed to measure impedance from multiple intraluminal recording sensors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The method allows detection of GER based on changes in electrical resistance to electrical current flow between two electrodes when a liquid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gas bolus moves between them. Impedance detects GER if there is a sequential drop in impedance to less than 50 percent of baseline values, starting distally above the lower esophageal sphincter and propagating retrograde to at least the next two more proximal measuring segments. Therefore, anterograde swallows can be differentiated from retrograde boluses (GER). This emerging technology is being employed as both a clinical and research tool in preterm infants.</p><p>The obvious advantage of MII is the ability to assess postprandial reflux, which may be masked by milk neutralizing the acid content of the refluxate when only a pH probe is used. This was illustrated in one study of preterm infants (gestational age of 23 to 37 weeks, tested at a postconceptional age between 34 to 48 weeks) that showed more episodes of reflux and less acidic reflux contents after versus before a feed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>However, several reservations associated with the use of MII in preterm infants remain, particularly the lack of validated normative standards in neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. When compared with pH measurement, MII detects more frequent and shorter duration episodes, which are of uncertain clinical significance. Finally, it is important not to measure impedance-based reflux alone, as there is a high incidence of acid reflux events detected by pH monitoring that is not identified by MII [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Acid reflux events missed by MII occurred most often in the least mature infants, possibly due to delayed esophageal fluid clearance in this immature population. To address this issue, MII has been combined with esophageal pH into a single probe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/46,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,49</a>]. In a study of newborns with symptoms suggesting gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the frequency of reflux events and percent of time with bolus reflux exposure, as measured by MII, were predictive of GERD symptoms in later infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Other techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Techniques used to detect GER in older infants and children, including endoscopy and esophageal manometry, are rarely employed in neonates because of size limitation. In addition, endoscopy is rarely indicated because its primary indication is to diagnose esophagitis, which is exceedingly rare in preterm infants. </p><p>Other studies that may be performed in neonates include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper gastrointestinal series &mdash; An upper gastrointestinal (UGI) series with small bowel follow-through should be performed in infants with severe GER. This study is used to evaluate esophageal, gastric, and intestinal anatomy because congenital anomalies in these structures may cause reflux or vomiting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, UGI is a poor method to demonstrate GER because the procedure is performed under nonphysiologic conditions that may provoke reflux that is not clinically important. Also, a UGI may not detect clinically significant GER because the period of fluoroscopic monitoring is brief, typically less than five minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Technetium scintigraphy &mdash; A nuclear medicine scintigraphy study, often commonly referred to as a milk scan, allows detection of esophageal reflux events and detection of aspirated gastric contents in the lungs. However, this technique is more likely to miss reflux events than continuous pH or MII monitoring.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial treatment for gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is conservative and consists of dietary changes and parental education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Pharmacologic therapy is reserved for infants who fail conservative management and who have symptoms or diagnostic test results strongly suspicious for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Infants without GER-related morbidity (&quot;happy spitters&quot;) should not be treated with medications, as recommended by expert panels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/1,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,52</a>]. However, these recommendations do not specifically address preterm infants, in whom it is often difficult to distinguish between GER and GERD, especially when deciding to initiate treatment and evaluate the efficacy of different therapies. Therefore, the following discussion reflects our practice, informed by available evidence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonpharmacologic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial nonpharmacologic therapy includes dietary changes and parental education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. We assure the parents that reflux is a common physiologic occurrence in preterm infants that will resolve on its own and generally does not need intervention. About one-half of all infants between zero and four months of age regurgitate at least once per day, with symptoms peaking at four months of age when the majority of infants have clinical GER. The use of a pacifier (&quot;dummy&quot;) does not increase GER [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In term and older infants with presumed symptomatic GER, several dietary manipulations appear to have some efficacy, including smaller more frequent feeds and thickened feeds. For preterm infants with GER, these dietary modifications have not been adequately studied to determine whether they are effective. In particular, it remains unclear whether thickening of feeds with infant cereal is effective in preterm infants, as the available limited data report conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. Moreover, the use of feeds thickened by infant cereal may be challenging in preterm infants with weak oromotor skills or who are fed by tube-feeds. If cereal is used to thicken feeds, an oat-based cereal is now preferred over rice cereal, due to concerns about possible contamination of rice with arsenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>].

The increased risk of GER in preterm infants is thought to be due to immature or impaired anatomic and physiologic factors. Most infants have no complications from their GER and do not require further evaluation or intervention because GER usually resolves without intervention by one year of age. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GER disease (GERD) is defined as GER that causes morbidity. Signs or symptoms that are often attributed to GER include irritability, nonspecific behaviors suggesting discomfort such as posturing or grimacing, frequent bouts of emesis, worsening of lung disease, and failure to thrive. However, it is likely that in many cases GER is not the underlying cause of these symptoms. In addition, GER is probably not a common trigger or mechanism for pathologic apnea of prematurity, although in selected cases a causal relationship may exist. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of GERD is challenging in preterm infants because symptoms are nonspecific, and diagnostic testing (esophageal pH and multiple intraluminal impedance monitoring) is limited due to technical problems and difficulties of interpreting results in the newborn. Moreover, esophageal monitoring rarely establishes a causal association between GER and pathologic consequences. As a result, the diagnosis of GERD usually depends on the clinician's clinical suspicion that a pathological problem in an individual (eg, poor growth, apnea of prematurity, or chronic lung disease) is likely to be caused by GER, based on a global assessment and exclusion of other causes of the symptoms. In some cases, an empiric time-limited trial of acid suppression is used in an attempt to clarify the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Acid suppression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment should be reserved for infants in whom there is concern for reflux causing harmful sequelae. Management initially is begun with nonpharmacologic measures that include dietary changes (eg, smaller frequent feeds, and thickened feeds using oat cereal) based upon evidence from term and older infants and parental education. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroesophageal-reflux-in-infants#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroesophageal reflux in infants&quot;, section on 'Lifestyle changes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacologic therapy should <strong>not</strong> be used for infants with uncomplicated GER (ie, those without significant pathological problems that are attributable to GER).
