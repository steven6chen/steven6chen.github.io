It can lead to blindness and, very rarely, death.</p><p>Orbital cellulitis can happen when bacteria get into the tissues around the eyeball. Most cases happen in people who have sinusitis. Sinusitis is an infection of the sinuses, the hollow areas in the bones of the face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75045 \">figure 2</a>). It can also happen if a person has:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye surgery or an injury near the eye</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blocked tear duct</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An infection in a tooth, an ear, or somewhere in the face</p><p/><p>A more common eye infection is called &quot;preseptal cellulitis&quot; or &quot;periorbital cellulitis.&quot; This is different from orbital cellulitis, but it has some of the same symptoms. These include eye pain and swollen, red eyelids. But preseptal cellulitis affects only the eyelid and is not as serious as orbital cellulitis. Orbital cellulitis affects the deeper tissues around the eyeball, though the eyelid can be affected, too.</p><p>Both orbital cellulitis and preseptal cellulitis are most common in young children. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7897847\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of orbital cellulitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eyelid swelling and redness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Double vision</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the eyeball.

You will probably need an imaging test such as a CT scan or MRI. These tests take pictures of the inside of the head, including the eyes and sinuses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7897877\"><span class=\"h1\">How is orbital cellulitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics &ndash; Antibiotics are medicines that treat infections caused by bacteria. Antibiotics for orbital cellulitis are given into a vein through a small tube called an &quot;IV.&quot; Usually, people who get them start to get better in about 3 to 5 days. Once you start getting better, you can switch to antibiotic pills. You will need to take these for at least 2 to 3 weeks and maybe longer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; This is done only if:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An imaging test shows signs of an &quot;abscess.&quot; An abscess is a pocket of pus inside the head near the eye.
