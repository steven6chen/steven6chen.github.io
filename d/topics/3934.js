The typical incubation period for infection ranges from 2 to 14 days, although longer incubation periods have been observed among immunosuppressed hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16</a>]. After the acute infection, many patients experience persistent symptoms, such as fatigue, memory impairment, weakness, headache, and balance problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>]. Once a patient recovers, immunity to WN virus is thought to be life-long; if reinfection occurs, it is very rare. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">West Nile fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual presentation of WN virus infection is a self-limited illness, called WN fever, which is indistinguishable from dengue fever and other viral syndromes. The illness is characterized by an abrupt onset of fever, headache, malaise, back pain, myalgias, and anorexia. Despite the name &quot;West Nile fever&quot;, some patients report very low grade or no fever at all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Eye pain, pharyngitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain can also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Generalized lymphadenopathy, although commonly reported in the past, is rare in contemporary outbreaks. Acute symptoms typically last 3 to 10 days, but some patients with WN fever report a prolonged recovery to their previous baseline functioning.</p><p>Rash appears in approximately 25 to 50 percent of patients with WN fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/1,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22</a>]. The rash is typically found on the chest, back, and arms, is morbilliform or maculopapular, and is sometimes accompanied by complaints of dysesthesia and pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. It often appears at the time of defervescence and generally lasts for less than one week (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54623\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54623 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, rash may be associated with a decreased risk of neuroinvasive disease and death. As an example, in an analysis of two large-scale outbreaks of WN virus, age-adjusted risks were significantly decreased for encephalitis, meningitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> death among those with rash. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroinvasive disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>WN virus neuroinvasive disease presents as fever in conjunction with meningitis, encephalitis, flaccid paralysis, or a mixed pattern of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Encephalitis is more commonly reported than meningitis in older age groups, while meningitis occurs more commonly in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/2,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,27,28</a>]. The mortality rate of patients with neuroinvasive disease is approximately 10 percent. Possible risk factors for death include increasing age, male gender, encephalitis with severe muscle weakness, changes in the level of consciousness, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hepatitis C virus infection, alcohol misuse, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24</a>]. </p><p>The clinical features of meningitis and encephalitis associated with WN virus infection are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of meningitis associated with WN virus are similar to those of other viral meningitis and includes fever, headache, meningeal signs, and photophobia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Encephalitis ranges in severity from a mild, self-limited confusional state to severe encephalopathy, coma, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Extrapyramidal symptoms are common and suggest WN virus as an etiology of encephalitis, particularly during mosquito season in summer and early fall. Common neurological manifestations include coarse tremor and myoclonus, particularly in the upper extremities, as well as parkinsonian features such as rigidity, postural instability, and bradykinesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Patients report substantial functional and cognitive difficulties for up to a year following the acute infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p/><p>WN virus infection can also cause an acute flaccid paralysis syndrome. Paralysis results from an anterior horn cell process suggestive of poliomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/30,32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32-36</a>]. Patients present with asymmetric weakness of the limbs that rapidly develops within the first 48 hours after symptom onset. Symptoms can occur with or without overt meningitis or encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/30,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32</a>]. Approximately one-third of affected patients recover strength to near baseline, one-third modestly improve, and one-third fail to improve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Recovery mostly occurs within the first six to eight months of illness. Quadriplegia and respiratory failure are associated with high morbidity and mortality; however, even patients with initially severe and profound paralysis may experience profound recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Other manifestations of WN virus-associated neurologic disease include brachial plexopathy, demyelinating neuropathy, motor axonopathy, axonal polyneuropathy, involvement of ventral spinal roots, myasthenia gravis, and a disorder similar in character to Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/24,38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,38-40</a>]. Thus, it is imperative that appropriate diagnostic testing, including lumbar puncture, electromyography, and nerve conduction studies, be obtained before initiating therapies for Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome or other inflammatory neuropathies. (See <a href=\"#H73607914\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Less common neurologic manifestations of WN virus include cranial nerve palsies resulting in facial weakness, vertigo, dysarthria, seizures, cerebellar ataxia, and dysphagia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/26,31,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,31,41,42</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26598549\"><span class=\"h2\">Ocular manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common ocular manifestations include chorioretinitis, retinal hemorrhages, and vitreitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/43-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-48</a>]. The chorioretinal lesions are multifocal with a &quot;target-like&quot; appearance. Other reported ocular findings include iridocyclitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], occlusive vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], and uveitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Persistent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> possibly permanent visual deficits are frequently caused by optic neuritis and occlusive vasculitis, which are less commonly observed lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>A prospective study of patients presenting to a hospital with WN virus infection in Tunisia found that 80 percent had multifocal chorioretinitis with a mild vitreous inflammatory reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Most patients were asymptomatic and findings were self-limited. In a cohort of patients evaluated a median of 6.8 years post-infection, 24 percent had evidence of WN virus-associated retinopathy, which was more frequent in older patients and those with diabetes mellitus or a history of encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26598555\"><span class=\"h2\">Other features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>WN virus infection has been associated with many other less commonly reported complications including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rhabdomyolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatal hemorrhagic fever with multi-organ failure and palpable purpura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis and pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central diabetes insipidus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myositis and orchitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1110700771\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women who have been infected with WN virus during pregnancy have delivered infants without evidence of infection or clinical abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. However, there is some evidence that transplacental transmission of WN virus can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/59,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,62</a>].

Since cord blood or infant serum at the time of delivery was not available, it was unknown whether transplacental transmission occurred or whether the infants were infected at the time of delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, a follow-up study of 28 infants born to mothers with WN virus infection during pregnancy showed no differences in birth weight, length, head circumference, Apgar scores, and frequency of congenital anomalies compared with infants born to mothers without WN virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

As an example, in a study of 157 patients with WN virus (most with neuroinvasive disease), 40 percent continued to experience symptoms possibly related to their infection (eg, fatigue, weakness, depression, <span class=\"nowrap\">neck/back</span> pain) for up to eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Patients with encephalitis, and those who were over age 50, were significantly more likely to report continued symptoms. Among those with encephalitis, 70 percent were still reporting symptoms related to their infection five-and-a-half years after the initial diagnosis (95% CI 57.8 to 82.3 percent). A more detailed discussion on the long-term prognosis of patients with WN neuroinvasive disease is found elsewhere.

Testing of serum or CSF is available commercially, and also can be obtained through local or state health departments. Because IgM antibody does not cross the blood-brain barrier, detection of IgM antibodies in CSF is highly indicative of WN virus neuroinvasive disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">IgM antibody may not be detectable at the time of clinical presentation in those with early disease (eg, WN fever). In such patients, paired testing of acute and convalescent-phase specimens should provide a definitive diagnosis (see <a href=\"#H1152718944\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below). IgM seroconversion usually develops between 4 and 10 days after viremia is detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>]. In our experience, patients with neuroinvasive disease are more likely than those with WN fever to have a positive MAC-ELISA test result at the time of clinical presentation. Clinicians should also bear in mind that IgM antibody to WN virus may persist for six months or longer. Thus, patients from endemic areas may have detectable IgM antibody from a previous WN virus infection that is unrelated to their current clinical illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/75,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,77</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">False positive WN virus MAC-ELISA testing can occur because antibodies to other arthropod-borne flaviviruses can cross-react with this test. A false positive result can be due to recent immunization with flavivirus vaccines (yellow fever or Japanese encephalitis) or due to infections with other related flaviviruses (eg, St. Louis encephalitis, dengue) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].

The PRNT test is not commercially available, but is able to be performed by reference labs such at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> certain state health departments. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Typically, neutralizing antibody titers are assessed for several flaviviruses, depending upon the epidemiological situation. A sample is considered to have antibodies to a particular flavivirus if neutralizing antibody titers are at least fourfold greater for that virus than all other tested flaviviruses. One important caveat is that PRNT cannot reliably differentiate antibodies to the current infecting virus from antibodies resulting from a previous heterologous flavivirus exposure. As an example, the PRNT may not be able to confirm WN virus as the source of infection in a patient with a past history of Japanese encephalitis vaccination or dengue (neutralizing antibody titers are often highest to the original infecting flavivirus). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral detection is highly specific, but is of limited value for routine diagnosis since viremia in humans is found early in the course of disease (often before symptoms develop), is of low titer, and is short-lived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/76,79-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,79-81</a>].

The two most common manifestations of WN virus infection are fever and neuroinvasive disease. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>WN fever is characterized by fever, headache, malaise, back pain, myalgias, and anorexia. A maculopapular rash appears in up to one-half of such patients. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'West Nile fever'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>WN neuroinvasive disease can present as encephalitis, meningitis, or an acute asymmetric flaccid paralysis. Encephalitis that is associated with muscle weakness and flaccid paralysis is particularly suggestive of WN virus infection. Other neurologic manifestations include tremor, myoclonus, and Parkinsonian features such as rigidity, postural instability, and bradykinesia. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Neuroinvasive disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the acute infection, many patients with WN virus infection experience persistent symptoms, such as fatigue, memory impairment, weakness, headache, and balance problems. (See <a href=\"#H6327321\" class=\"local\">'Persistent symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, routine clinical laboratory studies done on peripheral blood samples do not distinguish WN virus infection from other viral infections. In cases with central nervous system involvement, the cerebrospinal fluid usually demonstrates an elevated protein (&lt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> and a moderate pleocytosis (&lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> with a predominance of lymphocytes. However, neutrophils may predominate in early infection. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diagnosis of acute infection with WN virus is best made through detection of WN-specific antibodies, or in some instances by detection of viral RNA by nucleic acid amplification tests such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In patients who present with suspected meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis, we recommend a lumbar puncture and testing of the CSF for detection of IgM antibody as well as serum testing. (See <a href=\"#H73607914\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgM testing should be performed using a MAC-ELISA assay. Repeat testing at least 10 days after symptom onset is warranted for patients with a clinically compatible illness whose initial IgM results are negative. The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is the most specific antibody test and can help distinguish serologic cross-reactions caused by recent immunization against or infection with other flaviviruses.
