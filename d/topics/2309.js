Part of the problem relates to the lack of specificity of these &quot;classic&quot; symptoms of asthma. Despite this uncertainty, the following typical pathophysiologic features both characterize and assist in the diagnostic evaluation of the patient with asthma:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reversibility of airflow limitation.

The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program strongly encourages confirmation of the diagnosis with objective testing that shows reversibility of airflow limitation (eg, before and after bronchodilator, in response to ongoing therapy, or bronchoprovocation challenge) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. For patients with typical intermittent asthma symptoms and normal baseline spirometry, a clear clinical response to empiric therapy may be adequate diagnostically. However, the cost and side effects of asthma treatment often warrant objective confirmation of the diagnosis with bronchoprovocation testing. Such testing is indicated in several clinical situations where the clinical question is &rdquo;does this patient really have asthma?&rdquo;, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient who has symptoms consistent with asthma but normal pulmonary function test results and no response to a bronchodilator. This situation is commonly encountered in patients with mild or well-managed asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Asthma is one of the important causes of unexplained chronic cough; however, in the absence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, a diagnosis other than asthma should be considered.

This is particularly useful when evaluating patients with mild asthma not on controller medications whose only physiologic abnormality may be airway hyperresponsiveness and provides an additional and objective endpoint other than symptoms alone. In rare cases, serial bronchoprovocation testing is used to assess the response to avoidance of occupational exposures in occupational asthma, although this is predominantly for research purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Identification of specific asthma triggers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most bronchoprovocation tests use a nonspecific agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>) to assist in making the diagnosis of asthma. On rare occasions, it is necessary to test bronchoreactivity to specific food additives, occupational agents, or environmental antigens.

Guidelines regarding patient preparation and contraindications to methacholine challenge are listed in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82058\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82058 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62151\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62151 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51312\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51312 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Personnel performing the test should be able to recognize severe bronchospasm; a rapid acting beta agonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a>) should be immediately available either as a metered dose inhaler or nebulizer treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/2,3,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,18</a>]. Demonstration that the FEV<sub>1</sub> has returned to or exceeded baseline should be obtained before the patient leaves the pulmonary function laboratory. Resuscitation equipment should also be available. </p><p>Patients with unstable cardiac disease or a myocardial infarction or stroke within the past three months are excluded from bronchoprovocation testing due to the physical exertion of the repeated measurements of spirometry (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82058\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82058 \">table 1</a>). However, among adults without cardiac disease, the risk of adverse cardiac effects appears minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Bronchoprovocation challenge should only be initiated in the absence of signs or symptoms of significant airflow obstruction. In patients with significant baseline impairment in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), a bronchodilator reversibility study is usually indicated instead of bronchoprovocation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60462\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef60462 \">algorithm 1</a>). Cutoff values below which bronchoprovocation testing is not routinely performed vary; guidelines suggest exclusion of patients with an FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;60 percent predicted, or an FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;1.5 liters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/2,3,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,16</a>].

In this study, all but 4 of 88 patients returned to &gt;90 percent of their baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> following a single inhaled beta-agonist treatment, and the four nonresponders improved satisfactorily after a second treatment. No patients in this study experienced any adverse sequelae. However, bronchoprovocation testing in patients with this degree of baseline airflow obstruction should only be performed with caution.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11359060\"><span class=\"h1\">ENSURING ADEQUATE SPIROMETRY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reproducible spirometry is key to the performance of bronchoprovocation testing. Nose clips help to prevent leakage through the nasal passages and improve reliability. The testing requires multiple spirometric maneuvers, so it is important to explain to the patient the need for maximal and vigorous efforts and the importance of deep inhalation to full lung capacity for each maneuver. Depending on the protocol used, the exhalation time is two seconds (sometimes called a forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] maneuver) or six seconds (most common). The shorter time may be used to decrease the respiratory effort and is often acceptable when vocal cord dysfunction is not a concern. When vocal cord dysfunction is suspected, a full flow volume loop is needed. Usually, two spirometric maneuvers are obtained at baseline and at each time point of the test. Details about proper coaching of patients during testing and assessing the adequacy of the flow-volume or FEV<sub>1</sub> tracing are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-spirometry#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office spirometry&quot;, section on 'Coaching the patient'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-spirometry#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office spirometry&quot;, section on 'Adequacy of test'</a>.)</p><p>During the testing, the spirometric tracings are observed to make sure that the patient has fully inhaled to total lung capacity (TLC) prior to performing the expiratory maneuver. If the patient does not fully inhale to TLC, a decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> can occur without bronchoconstriction and cause a false positive result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Generally, forced vital capacity (FVC) is not used as an outcome measure for bronchoprovocation. Decreases in FVC usually reflect an inadequate inspiratory effort, incomplete exhalation, or an increase in residual volume (RV) due to airtrapping. Reports show that obesity and asthma cause an increase in the relative fall in FVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>For patients who have difficulty performing spirometry that meets acceptability standards, measures of airway resistance such as the forced oscillation technique or specific airway conductance [sGaw], which require little or less patient effort, can be used as alternative end-points [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/2,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14</a>]. Usually changes in sGaw mirror changes in FEV<sub>1</sub>, although sGaw changes are more variable. Thus, a larger percent change in sGaw (eg, 45 percent) is required for a positive test. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary function testing in asthma&quot;, section on 'Bronchodilator responses'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGIC CHALLENGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic challenge procedures determine the dose-response characteristics of the airways to a provocative challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. When performing inhalational challenges, it is crucial that the solutions and nebulizer apparatus are prepared in a standardized fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Depending on the indication for testing, some or all of the patients&rsquo; medications may need to be stopped prior to testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62151\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62151 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/3,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,24</a>]. Generally, inhaled glucocorticoids (ICS) are not stopped as it takes three weeks for the effect to wear off. However, a negative test while the patient is using ICS implies that the patient&rsquo;s current symptoms are not due to asthma, but does not rule out underlying asthma. To exclude airways hyperresponsiveness, the test would need to be repeated at least three weeks after discontinuation of ICS and when the patient has asthma like symptoms. In addition, a cohort-control study of patients taking controller medication for asthma found that the sensitivity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> challenge is lower in whites and non-atopic patients, than in African-American and atopic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5623382\"><span class=\"h2\">Delivery of pharmacologic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of provocative agents are administered via a nebulizer device (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a>, histamine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a>). The dose of a provocative agent that actually reaches the intrathoracic airways from an aerosol device can be difficult to quantify. In addition, the relative importance of the many factors (eg, nebulizer output, aerosol particle size, respiratory pattern) that influence aerosol delivery is largely unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p>In order to improve test standardization, the aerosol dose is reported as the concentration of the agonist <span class=\"nowrap\">(mg/mL)</span> in the nebulizer. Increasing concentrations of the provoking agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a>, histamine) are followed by spirometry at each step to generate a reproducible dose-response curve. In an attempt to standardize the delivered dosage, the agent is inhaled via a standardized aerosol delivery system (eg, an output of 0.13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> while the subject performs a specific breathing maneuver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/26,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The breathing maneuver typically uses a fixed inhalation scheme, for example, five vital capacity breaths with a breathhold, or two minutes of quiet (tidal volume) breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/2,16,28,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,16,28,30-32</a>]. The five vital capacity breath method is not equivalent to the two minutes of quiet breathing method for patients with mild hyperresponsiveness, probably due to the protective and bronchodilator effects of large vital capacity breaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Therefore, the quiet or tidal volume breathing method yields greater sensitivity. Alternatively, the five inhalations followed by breathhold can be modified to use a submaximal inhalation, approximately 50 or 60 percent below total lung capacity, followed by a breathhold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/21,30,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,30,33</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchial challenge tests are often classified as direct or indirect based on postulated mechanisms. Direct stimuli, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> and histamine, are thought to cause bronchoconstriction via direct stimulation of airway smooth muscle receptors, whereas indirect stimuli (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> monophosphate, eucapnic hyperventilation) cause bronchoconstriction through one or more intermediate pathways, typically involving release of inflammatory mediators (eg, prostaglandin D2, leukotriene E4) from mast cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, direct stimuli such as histamine or methacholine also affect other cells besides smooth muscle, such as nerves and mucous containing cells, so this distinction is somewhat artificial.</p><p>Histamine has been used in research studies of bronchial challenge, but is much less commonly employed clinically than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a>, due to its frequent induction of flushing and headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In addition, histamine is not commercially available for this use. Methacholine and histamine challenge appear to give equivalent results in selected groups of asthmatic subjects, but in theory, they are not equivalent challenges since they stimulate different receptors and histamine is known to activate airway neural reflexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/31,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,36</a>].</p><p>Other compounds that have been used or advocated for use in bronchoprovocation challenge include bradykinin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> monophosphate (AMP), hypertonic saline, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/29,37-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,37-50</a>]. As an example, one study comparing serial AMP and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> challenge testing in 120 asthmatics found that AMP was more closely associated with other markers of airway inflammation, and more sensitive to subtle changes in airway responsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Administration of these compounds appears to distinguish patients with asthma from normal subjects; however, clinical experience is more limited than with methacholine or histamine. In addition, normative data on the expected effect of inhaled AMP in normal control subjects is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. </p><p>In general, it appears that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> is more sensitive for airway hyperresponsiveness, but less specific compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>, and mannitol results are more in agreement with exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/29,52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,52,53</a>]. The optimal roles of methacholine and mannitol challenge in the assessment of airway hyperresponsiveness for clinical purposes remain unclear. Since the challenge modalities are not equivalent, this supports the notion that airway hyperresponsiveness is the expression of more than one mechanism as seen with animal models.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Methacholine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methacholine</a>, a derivative of acetylcholine, is the agent most commonly used for bronchoprovocation and is an acceptable form of bronchoprovocation for assessing asthma in Olympic athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Bronchoconstriction due to methacholine is of longer duration than that due to acetylcholine, thus facilitating measurement of the response.

As shown in the table, these solutions are usually prepared in two-fold dilutions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51312\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51312 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>After baseline spirometry that meets criteria noted elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-spirometry#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office spirometry&quot;, section on 'Adequacy of test'</a>), either diluent (most common) or the most dilute concentration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> is administered by nebulizer, using either a tidal breathing or five breath dosimeter method (see <a href=\"#H5623382\" class=\"local\">'Delivery of pharmacologic agents'</a> above). After inhalation of the aerosol by one of these methods, the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) is measured at 30 and 90 seconds with careful coaching of the subject to obtain an acceptable quality FEV<sub>1</sub>. Each time two maneuvers are performed; if FEV<sub>1</sub> is the only outcome being measured, it is acceptable to shorten the expiratory time to about two seconds (from the usual six seconds), unless there is a suspicion of vocal cord dysfunction in which case a full vital capacity maneuver with inspiratory and expiratory phases is performed. </p><p>The concentration is sequentially increased one concentration step at a time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51312\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51312 \">table 3</a>), until a decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> greater than 20 percent or a 35 to 40 percent decrease in specific airways conductance (SGaw) is observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/2,3,16,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,16,27</a>]. Typically, when there is a positive test, the FEV<sub>1</sub> decreases more than 20 percent, so the dose of the inhaled agent that would provoke a 20 percent drop in FEV<sub>1</sub> is determined by interpolation. This is referred to as the provocative concentration or PC20. Generally, a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> PC20 of 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> (&lt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL,</span> for SGaw) or less is considered a positive test.

The effective concentration that would have resulted in a given change in the outcome indicator is determined by interpolation.

Nevertheless, since the response to these agents can be quite severe, a negative test result can be clinically important, because it will free patients from concern about the ingestion of these compounds.</p><p>A bronchospastic response to a food additive is a relatively uncommon problem in asthma, since less than 5 percent of the asthmatic population is thought to be sensitive to these compounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoprovocation-testing/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Testing, which should be done in specialized laboratories, involves blinded challenge with the agent in question and serial monitoring of lung function.</p><p>Oral food challenges for the diagnosis of food allergy are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Rationale'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonspecific bronchoprovocation testing (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>, exercise) is indicated when the diagnosis of asthma is in question (eg, symptoms are atypical, baseline spirometry is normal), when a patient is suspected of having occupational asthma, reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS), or irritant-induced asthma, and when a screening test for asthma is required for scuba divers, military personnel, or other individuals in whom bronchospasm would pose an unacceptable hazard. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The contraindications to bronchoprovocation challenge and a list of medications that need to be discontinued prior to testing are listed in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82058\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82058 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62151\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62151 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic challenge'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methacholine</a> inhalation challenge is the most common type of pharmacologic challenge. Patients breathe progressively stronger doses of methacholine according to a protocol (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60462\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef60462 \">algorithm 1</a>). The dose of methacholine that provokes a 20 percent drop in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) is referred to as the PC20. Generally, a PC20 of 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> methacholine or less is considered a positive test. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic challenge'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mannitol</a> inhalation challenge is mediated by release of bronchoconstrictive mediators. The contraindications and a list of medications that need to be discontinued are the same as for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82058\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82058 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62151\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62151 \">table 2</a>). Mannitol challenge is performed by oral inhalation of a dry powder at progressively increasing doses. A 15 percent fall in FEV<sub>1</sub> at a total cumulative dose of &le;635 mg (known as the provocative dose or PD15) is considered a positive response. (See <a href=\"#H22416491\" class=\"local\">'Mannitol'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise testing and eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea (EVH) are forms of bronchoprovocation used for patients with symptoms suggestive of asthma during exercise, but with normal spirometry at rest. A small portion of patients with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction have negative tests to pharmacologic bronchoprovocation tests, so exercise testing and EVH are needed for diagnostic purposes and sometimes to assess the response to therapy. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Exercise challenge'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For formal exercise challenge tests, the patient is exercised on a treadmill or cycle ergometer to 80 to 90 percent of predicted maximum heart rate (220 minus age in years) for six to eight minutes. Patients should reach 40 to 60 percent of their predicted maximum voluntary ventilation. Spirometry is performed prior to exercise, and at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes thereafter. A test is generally considered positive if the FEV<sub>1</sub> decreases by 10 percent, although a fall of 15 percent is more diagnostic. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Exercise challenge'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea testing, the patient breathes dry hypercapnic air for six minutes at a minute ventilation of 30 times the FEV<sub>1</sub>. Spirometry is performed prior to the test, and at 5, 10, and 15 minutes after completion. A test is generally considered positive if the FEV<sub>1</sub> decreases by 10 percent or more. (See <a href=\"#H5620471\" class=\"local\">'Eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhalation of nebulized allergens (eg, dust mite, animal danders, occupational agents) carries greater risk and is reserved for research purposes, occupational asthma, and rare clinical situations. (See <a href=\"#H26846610\" class=\"local\">'Antigen challenge'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Occupational asthma: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Specific bronchoprovocation challenge'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The indications, contraindications, and technique of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> challenge in patients suspected of having aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease are discussed separately.
