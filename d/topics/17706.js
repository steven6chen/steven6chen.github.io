Its psychoactive properties are primarily due to one cannabinoid: delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); THC concentration is commonly used as a measure of cannabis potency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cannabis-use-disorder/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Cannabis use disorder develops in approximately 10 percent of regular cannabis users and may be associated with cognitive impairment, poor school or work performance, and psychiatric comorbidity such as mood disorders and psychosis. </p><p>The treatment of cannabis use disorder is reviewed here. Clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of cannabis use disorder in adults are reviewed separately. The epidemiology and health consequences of cannabis use and cannabis use disorder are also reviewed separately. The pathogenesis and pharmacology of cannabis use disorder in adults are also reviewed separately.

Treatment may occur in an inpatient hospital setting if the patient is psychotic, suicidal, severely depressed or agitated, or requires hospitalization because of another concurrent psychiatric disorder.</p><p>The patient's social network, especially family, should be involved in treatment to the extent possible (and agreed to by the patient, if a legally competent adult), in order to provide additional history and therapeutic support and to help monitor the patient's progress and adherence to treatment.</p><p>Patients should generally aim to achieve sustained abstinence from cannabis rather than a lower level of use that does not impair functioning, although there are no clinical studies directly comparing long-term outcomes from the two approaches. It may be necessary to accept moderate use as an initial treatment goal in order to engage some patients in the treatment process. Patients may develop a series of goals along the way to abstinence, such as abstaining from cannabis but not nicotine, reducing the frequency or amount of cannabis used, or limiting cannabis use to low risk situations, for example, not driving while intoxicated. Other goals for treatment include improved psychological, social, and occupational functioning.</p><p>Cessation of cannabis use can lead to a withdrawal syndrome in which uncomfortable symptoms serve as negative reinforcement for resumption of cannabis use. Treatment of withdrawal symptoms with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronabinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronabinol</a> (synthetic delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) reduced withdrawal symptoms and improved treatment retention, but did not affect subsequent cannabis use in a clinical trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cannabis-use-disorder/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cannabis-withdrawal-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cannabis withdrawal: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Drug testing during treatment for cannabis use disorder is useful for monitoring progress and early detection of relapse. Intensive monitoring of substance use may increase recovery rates.</p><p>Most clinical trials of the efficacy of interventions for cannabis use disorder studied patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of cannabis dependence. Applying these findings to patients diagnosed with a DSM-5 cannabis use disorder is imprecise, but the most closely comparable patients are those with moderate to severe cannabis use disorder (ie, patients with four or more disorder symptoms within a 12-month period) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cannabis-use-disorder/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H332349223\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest psychosocial treatment rather than medication treatment as first line therapy for cannabis use disorder. There are no clinical trials comparing the two approaches, but clinical trials show evidence of efficacy for psychosocial interventions, while trials of medication have yielded only inconsistent or weak results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cannabis-use-disorder/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

These interventions have not been compared in head-to-head trials; the selection between them should be based on patient preference and treatment availability. (See <a href=\"#H1345207239\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4286968275\" class=\"local\">'Motivational interviewing/motivational enhancement'</a> below.)</p><p>If neither of these approaches are effective, a combination of CBT and MET, or adding contingency management to CBT or MET, is suggested.

Motivational interviewing is often combined with personalized feedback and education regarding the patient&rsquo;s patterns of cannabis use (often termed motivational enhancement therapy [MET]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cannabis-use-disorder/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

MET also reduced the number of disorder symptoms, but no difference was seen in one-month abstinence rates.</p><p>As an example, a clinical trial randomly assigned 120 adult cannabis users to a two-hour session of MET or drug-related health education found that MET reduced the mean number of joints used per day (standardized mean difference [SMD] =3.60, 95% CI 3.01-4.18) and the number of disorder symptoms (SMD = 5.16, 95% CI 4.41-5.92) at seven-week follow-up, but did not reduce the number of cannabis use days in the prior month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cannabis-use-disorder/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2173286236\"><span class=\"h2\">Contingency management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contingency management uses behavioral reinforcement techniques (typically a voucher incentive) to encourage specific behaviors that promote treatment adherence (eg, clinic attendance or provision of urine specimens) or abstinence (eg, provision of drug-free urine samples). Contingency management, which is reviewed in greater detail separately, has generally been found effective in increasing abstinence in other substance use disorders but there is no substantial evidence for its effectiveness in cannabis use disorder. The theoretical foundation, components, and implementation of contingency management are reviewed separately.

As an example, a trial randomly assigned 63 adults with cannabis dependence to voucher reinforcement for cannabis-negative urine samples over 12 weeks or weekly sessions of CBT over 12 weeks. No treatment group differences were seem in percentage of cannabis-positive urine specimens (57.1 versus 73.1 percent), self-reported cannabis use (31.9 versus 35.6 percent), or continuous abstinence (33.8 versus 35.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cannabis-use-disorder/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Contingency management has shown evidence of efficacy when added to MET, CBT, or their combination.

Counseling typically provides fact-based education regarding drug use and health risks, along with suggestions for minimizing harm. Counseling may also incorporate various elements of more focused therapy approaches, such as cognitive-behavioral, motivational enhancement, and insight-oriented psychotherapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cannabis-use-disorder/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Two low-quality clinical trials found no difference between drug counseling and a control intervention in patients with cannabis dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cannabis-use-disorder/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. As an example, a trial randomly assigned 50 cannabis-using university students to receive a single 15- to 20-minute session of drug counseling or a session about health promotion unrelated to substance use, finding no difference between groups in the frequency of cannabis-smoking days or joints used per day at 3- and 12-month follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cannabis-use-disorder/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H227726649\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening and brief intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) is a treatment model for patients with substance use problems or disorders developed for non-SUD speciality settings (eg, primary care, emergency departments) that combines screening of all adult patients to identify individuals with unhealthy use, including those with an SUD, with a brief counseling intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cannabis-use-disorder/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Mutual help groups for addiction recovery aim to help individuals suffering from substance use disorders achieve and maintain remission and recovery. Such mutual help groups are reported used by about half of adults with current cannabis use disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cannabis-use-disorder/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Marijuana Anonymous, founded in 1989, is based on the 12-step principles of Alcohol Anonymous. Its effectiveness has not been evaluated via formal studies.

On average, even the most effective treatments for cannabis use disorder lead to a reduction in use rather than sustained continuous abstinence. (See <a href=\"#H927461675\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest first-line treatment for cannabis use disorder with either cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or motivational enhancement treatment (MET) rather than other psychosocial or medication treatments (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). CBT and MET have shown comparable efficacy in cannabis use disorder; selection between them should be based on availability, patient preference, and patient history of prior treatment effectiveness. (See <a href=\"#H3343656292\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1345207239\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4286968275\" class=\"local\">'Motivational interviewing/motivational enhancement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are unable to maintain abstinence with CBT or MET alone, we suggest combining CBT and MET or adding contingency management rather than other interventions (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
