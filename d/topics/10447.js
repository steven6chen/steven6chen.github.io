These include diffuse and severe ST-segment deviation or significant ventricular arrhythmias on ECG monitoring or hypotension during exercise.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease or at high risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SIGNIFICANT LEFT MAIN DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) with optimal preventive therapies is preferred to optimal preventive therapies alone for all patients with significant left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-left-main-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) CABG significantly improves survival.</p><p>Most patients with significant LMCAD are symptomatic and at high risk of cardiovascular events, since occlusion of this vessel compromises flow to at least 75 percent of the left ventricle, unless it is protected by collateral flow or a patent bypass graft to either the left anterior descending coronary artery or circumflex artery. Without revascularization, three-year survival is as low as 37 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-left-main-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. CABG, when directly compared with medical therapy, is associated with significantly better cardiovascular outcomes, including mortality. In the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study performed in the 1970s, which compared a strategy of initial CABG versus deferred CABG, there was a substantial survival advantage for patients assigned to initial CABG at two years (93 versus 71 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-left-main-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>] and at 11 years, but not at 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-left-main-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The benefit was greatest in high-risk patients with greater than 75 percent left main stenosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> left ventricular dysfunction; there was a nonsignificant trend toward benefit in patients with 50 to 75 percent stenosis and normal left ventricular function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-left-main-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The outcomes of patients with LMCAD treated with CABG have improved over time. Reports of those who underwent CABG after 1995 suggest that the 30-day mortality ranges between 3 and 4.2 percent and the survival at two years is approximately 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-left-main-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thirty-day mortality is now under 2 percent in some United States databases. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H266319044\"><span class=\"h2\">PCI versus CABG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CABG has a long track record of safety and efficacy in patients with LMCAD. The application of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting to the left main coronary artery began in patients who were not candidates for CABG. Randomized trials and observational studies have suggested equivalent outcomes with these two forms of revascularization in some patients with LMCAD.</p><p>We arrive at the following conclusions regarding the studies presented below comparing CABG with PCI with stenting. The odd ratios (OR) given below come from a 2016 meta-analysis of the four major randomized trials discussed below plus one smaller trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-left-main-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At one year and longer, CABG and PCI appear to have similar rates of the combined end point of death from any cause, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79-1.17).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As the complexity of associated coronary artery disease increases, assessed either by the SYNTAX score or as the number of vessels that need revascularization, the benefit in favor of CABG over PCI with stenting increases. <br/><br/>For patients with lower complexity coronary disease who can undergo PCI at an acceptable risk and with reasonable probability for success, PCI may be an acceptable or even preferred option in some patients. Our experts prefer CABG for younger patients who have low surgical risk, for whom short-term surgical outcomes are favorable and potentially favorable long-term outcomes more meaningful. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CABG is associated with a significantly higher incidence of adverse in-hospital outcomes, including death, MI, and stroke.

There were no significant between-group differences in the three-year rates of the components of the primary end point. The secondary end point of death, stroke, or MI at 30 days occurred less often in patients in the PCI group (4.9 versus 7.9 percent) due mainly to a lower rate of MI.

The primary end point of major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events (a composite of all-cause mortality, nonprocedural MI, any repeat coronary revascularization, and stroke) at five years occurred more often with PCI (29 versus 19 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 1.48, 95% CI 1.11-1.96) attributable mainly to more frequent revascularization in the PCI group. There was also a higher rate of non-procedural MI and stroke, the latter of which is not consistent with all other trials.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The PRECOMBAT trial randomly assigned 600 patients with unprotected LMCAD to PCI with sirolimus-eluting stents or CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-left-main-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The primary end point of major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events (death from any cause, MI, stroke, or ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization) at one year met the criteria for noninferiority of PCI. The event rates were 8.7 and 6.7 percent for PCI and CABG (absolute risk difference 2, 95% CI -1.6 to 5.6, respectively) and the difference was attributable to the expected higher rate of ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization in the PCI group (6.1 versus 3.4 percent). The two groups had similar rates of the other individual components of the composite. <br/><br/>At two years, the event rates for the primary outcome were still higher but not significantly different with PCI (12.2 versus 8.1 percent with CABG). The difference between the two groups was due to a statistically significant higher rate of ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization with PCI (9 and 4.2 percent). The rates of stroke did not differ significantly (0.4 versus 0.7 percent). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><br/>At five years, the event rates for the primary outcome were 17.5 and 14.3 percent in the PCI and CABG groups, with the difference being not statistically different [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-left-main-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

For patients with unprotected distal left main disease and involvement of the origins of both the left anterior descending coronary artery and circumflex, we prefer a dedicated two-stent approach in most patients in whom PCI will be performed.

In many cases, the best approach may be determined by the specific anatomy. PCI of the distal left main coronary artery is technically challenging, and patients with potentially complicated anatomy should be treated only by highly skilled interventional cardiologists. The challenges are greater for bifurcation lesions involving both origins.

With this technique, both vessels are wired and an initial inflation of both origins is performed. The side branch (usually the circumflex) is stented first with a small portion (approximately 1 mm) of the stent extending into the left main coronary artery. The circumflex wire is removed and the protruding segment is crushed with an angioplasty balloon extending into the main vessel, which is usually the left anterior descending coronary artery. The circumflex is rewired and the first kissing balloon inflation is performed. A stent is then placed from left main to left anterior descending coronary artery. The circumflex is again rewired, and sequential high pressure inflations of the left anterior descending coronary artery and circumflex are performed followed by the final kissing balloon inflation at lower pressure.

A first stent is then placed into either the left anterior descending coronary artery or circumflex and extended into the left main coronary artery to fully cover the lesion. This stent should be sized according to the distal part of the lesion and the proximal segment must then be optimized with angioplasty using an appropriately sized non-compliant balloon (proximal optimization technique). The other vessel is then rewired through a stent strut, a balloon inflation is performed to open the stent strut, and then a second stent is delivered to also extend into the left main coronary artery. The first stented vessel is then rewired through the side of the second stent. After sequential high pressure inflations within each stent, a final kissing inflation is then performed. </p><p/><p>Early studies suggested that outcomes were poorer when distal left main bifurcation lesions are treated by a two-stent approach (ie, crush or kissing stents) rather than with provisional stenting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-left-main-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/35,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,39</a>]. In these early studies, the rate of target lesion revascularization (mostly by repeat catheter-based intervention with drug-eluting stents) was as high as 25 percent. Restenosis was essentially confined to distal lesions, the majority of which had been treated with stents in both branches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-left-main-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/25-27,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27,33</a>]. </p><p>The following randomized trials have compared two of the approaches described above in patients with unprotected distal left main bifurcation lesions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The DKCRUSH-III study randomly assigned 419 patients to a double kissing crush or a culotte technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-left-main-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

In such patients, the decision between coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and medical therapy is difficult. Adjunctive testing with either fractional flow reserve (FFR) or intracoronary ultrasonography (IVUS) has been used to guide therapy in such patients.
