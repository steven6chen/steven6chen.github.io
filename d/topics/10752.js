The mechanical obstruction leads to increases in pressure within the left atrium, pulmonary vasculature, and right side of the heart. Most cases of MS are caused by rheumatic heart disease with mitral commissural adhesion; thickened, immobile mitral valve leaflets; and fibrosis, thickening, shortening, fusion, and calcification of the chordae tendineae. Infrequent causes of MS include mitral annular calcification and congenital MS (including parachute mitral valve). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatic mitral stenosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and natural history of mitral stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The medical management and indications for intervention for MS will be reviewed here. Outcomes and management of patients undergoing percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy and mitral valve surgery for MS are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy for mitral stenosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-and-investigational-approaches-to-management-of-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical and investigational approaches to management of mitral stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H652116590\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING AND EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periodic monitoring is recommended in asymptomatic patients with MS to assess for disease progression and development of indications for intervention. For all patients, the follow-up should include yearly history and physical examination. Follow-up transthoracic echocardiography should be performed with frequency based upon the severity of disease. We agree with the 2014 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ACC)</span> valve guideline recommendation for echocardiography every three to five years if the mitral valve area (MVA) is &gt;1.5 cm<sup>2</sup>, every one to two years if the MVA is 1.0 to 1.5 cm<sup>2</sup>, and once per year if the MVA is &lt;1.0 cm<sup>2 </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The long interval between testing in asymptomatic, stable, mild disease is based in part upon the natural history of MS, as mitral valve area declines at a mean of approximately 0.1 cm<sup>2</sup> per year (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and natural history of mitral stenosis&quot;, section on 'Rate of progression'</a>). More frequent monitoring may be required in patients with concurrent mitral regurgitation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> disease affecting other valves. All patients should undergo re-evaluation whenever there is a change in clinical status. </p><p>Monitoring and evaluation prior to and during pregnancy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with mitral stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The rationale for monitoring is to optimize timing of mitral valve intervention. The timing of surgical or percutaneous intervention for MS is crucial for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If performed too early, the patient may be put at unnecessary risk for a complication of the procedure with little or no short-term benefit because MS (in the absence of intervention) may remain asymptomatic and stable for many years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delaying intervention may cause irreversible pulmonary hypertension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> right heart failure. The risk of failure to receive necessary corrective intervention was illustrated in a report that included patients in whom valve surgery was indicated but refused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patient survival with medical therapy was 44 percent at five years, 32 percent at 10 years, and 19 percent at 15 years. </p><p/><p>In patients who develop indications for mitral valve intervention, the feasibility of percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy is assessed by using the Wilkins score and by characterization of commissural calcification. Other criteria for percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy include absence of left atrial thrombus and lack of moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy for mitral stenosis&quot;, section on 'Echocardiography'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H159863971\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of thromboembolism</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H346400795\"><span class=\"h3\">Antithrombotic recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We agree with the antithrombotic recommendations for MS in the 2014 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology guideline on the management of valvular heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These recommendations are similar to those in the 2012 Ninth American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) consensus conference and 2012 European Society of Cardiology valve guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. As noted below, scant direct evidence is available to guide antithrombotic therapy in patients with MS.</p><p>We recommend anticoagulation (with vitamin K antagonist; target International Normalized Ratio [INR] 2.5) in patients with MS and one or more of the following conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial fibrillation (paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior embolic event</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left atrial thrombus</p><p/><p>Transient subclinical atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs in some patients with MS, and transient AF is a predictor of stroke and systemic embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Transient AF and infective endocarditis should be considered as potential causes when embolization occurs in patients with MS who are in sinus rhythm.</p><p>Monitoring patients for the development of an indication for percutaneous balloon mitral valvotomy may also help manage the thromboembolic risk since timely percutaneous intervention appears to reduce the risk of systemic embolism in patients with and without AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Indications for intervention'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy for mitral stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An exception to our agreement with the 2012 ACCP guidelines is that we do not suggest anticoagulation for patients with MS and left atrial diameter &gt;55 mm in the absence of another indication for anticoagulant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Use of anticoagulation in patients with MS in normal sinus rhythm with left atrial enlargement or spontaneous echocardiographic contrast on TEE is controversial since the utility of such treatment in managing the risk of thromboembolism is uncertain. </p><p>Newer oral anticoagulants, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a>, now are approved for prevention of systemic embolism in adults with nonvalvular AF. We recommend use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or heparin in adults with MS when anticoagulation is needed because patients with significant mitral valve disease were excluded from the trials of these newer agents. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H346400686\"><span class=\"h3\">Evidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic thromboembolism is a major complication of MS and is the presenting event in some patients. Prior to widespread anticoagulant therapy and surgical treatment in patients with MS, as many as 30 percent of patients with MS experienced an embolic event during the course of the disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-mitral-stenosis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatic mitral stenosis&quot;, section on 'Thromboembolism'</a>.)</p><p>The role of anticoagulation in patients with MS and AF has been primarily supported by extrapolation of data from AF in patients without MS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with MS have been excluded from most randomized trials examining the efficacy of long-term anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolism in patients with AF. An exception was a substudy of the NASPEAF trial that included 311 patients with MS and AF (with and without prior embolism) and 175 with nonvalvular AF and prior embolism, but this study was limited by small numbers of events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The patients were randomly assigned to anticoagulation therapy (target INR 2.0 to 3.0, median attained value 2.46) or moderate intensity anticoagulation (INR 1.4 to 2.4, median attained value 2.15) in combination with the antiplatelet agent triflusal, which is structurally related to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>. The primary end point was a composite of fatal and nonfatal stroke and myocardial infarction, sudden death, or death from bleeding. The following findings were noted at a median follow-up of 2.9 years:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the whole patient population, combined antiplatelet plus anticoagulant therapy significantly reduced the number of vascular events compared with anticoagulant therapy alone (14 versus 19 events).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with MS, the event rate was nominally lower with combined therapy than with anticoagulation alone both in patients with (3.5 versus 6.6 percent) and without (0.8 versus 2.5 percent) prior embolism. However, these differences were not statistically significant. </p><p/><p>Although left atrial enlargement and spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (along with atrial fibrillation and smaller mitral valve area) have been identified as predictors of thromboembolism in patients with MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/6,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,9</a>], the risks and benefits of anticoagulation for left atrial enlargement or spontaneous echocardiographic contrast in patients with MS in sinus rhythm are uncertain. Spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (SEC) is a marker of blood stasis associated with decreased atrial contractile function and increased risk of left atrial thrombus in patients with MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Among patients with MS, SEC is more frequent among patients in AF although some patients in sinus rhythm also have SEC, other evidence of decreased atrial function, and atrial thrombus. A transesophageal echocardiographic study of 848 patients with moderate to severe MS in sinus rhythm found left atrial thrombus in 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H346401352\"><span class=\"h2\">Other medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of symptoms requiring medical therapy is an indication for intervention in patients with severe MS. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Indications for intervention'</a> below.)</p><p>The role of medical therapy for MS is limited. Pharmacologic therapy is appropriate to improve symptoms and hemodynamic conditions prior to intervention, for persistent symptoms after intervention, and for management of symptoms precipitated by an intercurrent illness or during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis#H23166793\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with mitral stenosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical management'</a>.)</p><p>Diuretic therapy (usually with a loop diuretic) and dietary salt restriction are appropriate when there are manifestations of pulmonary vascular congestion such as exertional shortness of breath, orthopnea, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. At a later stage of MS, right heart failure can occur, with hepatic congestion and peripheral edema. Loop diuretics acutely improve such manifestations of the congestive state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of diuretics in patients with heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Beta blockers (or negative chronotropic calcium channel blockers) are used for heart rate control (in patients in atrial fibrillation or sinus rhythm) and to improve dyspnea, though their effect on exercise tolerance is uncertain. These agents can significantly decrease heart rate and cardiac output at rest, causing a decrease in the transmitral gradient, pulmonary venous pressure, and mean pulmonary artery pressure in patients with MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Beta blockers can blunt the heart rate and cardiac output responses to exercise, while attenuating the rise in transmitral gradient that normally occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, the impact of beta blockers on exercise tolerance is uncertain, with conflicting results from small trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. </p><p>The role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> in patients with MS is limited since most patients have preserved ventricular systolic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Digoxin may be helpful in selected patients who have symptomatic left <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> right ventricular systolic dysfunction as in patients with other causes of systolic heart failure. Digoxin may also be helpful in controlling a rapid ventricular rate during AF, although it should not be considered a first-line drug for this indication.

However, because of the exaggerated adverse hemodynamic effects caused by MS, prompt therapy is often necessary. In patients who are hemodynamically unstable, immediate electrical cardioversion is indicated. For hemodynamically stable patients, the initial management consists of controlling the ventricular rate (with a beta blocker, calcium channel blocker [<a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>], or, less preferably, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>) and anticoagulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial fibrillation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Pharmacologic therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H346400795\" class=\"local\">'Antithrombotic recommendations'</a> above.)</p><p>When MS is hemodynamically significant (valve area &lt;1.5 cm<sup>2</sup>), flow across the mitral valve is maintained by two factors: adequate diastolic filling time and higher-than-normal pulmonary venous pressure. AF in patients with MS may be poorly tolerated for two reasons, with the hemodynamic consequences depending upon the severity of the stenosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If AF is associated with a rapid ventricular rate, the shortened diastolic filling time causes left atrial and pulmonary pressures to rise, potentially leading to pulmonary edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodynamic-consequences-of-atrial-fibrillation-and-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodynamic consequences of atrial fibrillation and cardioversion to sinus rhythm&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The loss of atrial contraction contributes to a decrease in left ventricular filling and an increase in left atrial pressure. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Rate versus rhythm control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A rate control strategy is generally preferred because, based upon studies in patients with nonvalvular AF, outcomes are as good as or perhaps better than with a rhythm control strategy and, with a rhythm control strategy, long-term anticoagulation is still required in most patients. Conversion to sinus rhythm may be necessary if heart rate cannot be adequately controlled with medications. In patients not requiring urgent cardioversion, the decision for rate control versus rhythm control is based upon multiple factors including the duration of AF, hemodynamic response to AF, symptoms, and left atrial size. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhythm control versus rate control in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients in whom a rhythm control strategy is chosen, issues related to the method of restoration of sinus rhythm, anticoagulation before, during, and after cardioversion, and antiarrhythmic drug therapy to maintain sinus rhythm are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Cardioversion to sinus rhythm&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of embolization prior to and after restoration of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiarrhythmic-drugs-to-maintain-sinus-rhythm-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-recommendations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation: Recommendations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Regardless of the initial response to antiarrhythmic therapy, it may become increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to maintain sinus rhythm as the severity of MS progresses. In many patients with MS, the onset of AF may contribute to the onset of symptoms. Percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy has been suggested by some experts for new AF in patients MS since intervention may aid conversion to sinus rhythm. Catheter AF ablation is an option in selected patients with MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Patients with indications with mitral valve surgery may undergo concomitant surgical AF ablation.

Acceptable regimens and issues related to the duration of prophylaxis are discussed separately. Regardless of whether or not prophylaxis is continued, there should always be a low threshold to test and treat these patients for acute group A streptococcal pharyngitis.

Although chronic degenerative changes associated with MS may represent a response to turbulent blood flow through the rheumatically deformed valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], there is also evidence that repeated episodes of rheumatic carditis contribute to the natural history of MS even when no clinical signs of acute rheumatic fever have been present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Thus, preventing repeated attacks of rheumatic fever may play a role in delaying the progression of MS.</p><p>The risk for recurrence of rheumatic fever declines with increasing age and the number of years since the patient's most recent attack, and it has been declining in the United States.

Recurrences of rheumatic fever tend to mimic previous attacks for any particular patient such that the absence of carditis during the initial attack usually means it will also not be a feature during future attacks.

Anesthetic agents and muscle relaxants associated with decreased heart rates are preferred. Among patients with atrial fibrillation, the ventricular rate should be well controlled prior to elective surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Careful management of central blood volume &ndash; Pulmonary venous pressure (ie, pulmonary artery balloon occlusion pressure) should be monitored and maintained high enough to allow adequate cardiac output but low enough to avoid pulmonary edema. Because of the obstruction to flow from left atrium to left ventricle, any situation that increases venous return and central blood volume will lead to a rise in pulmonary pressures and congestion. As an example, the Trendelenburg position dramatically increases pulmonary blood flow and can cause overt pulmonary edema. Right heart pressure monitoring during surgery is essential to manage the volume status.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance of systemic vascular resistance &ndash; MS impairs the normal compensatory response associated with a fall in blood pressure, since the stroke volume cannot be substantially increased.
