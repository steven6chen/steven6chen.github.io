These differences correlate with important differences in biologic behavior and thus have important implications for patient management. Low-grade gliomas can develop anywhere in the central nervous system, although studies usually are directed to a particular location (eg, cerebral hemispheres, optic pathways, brainstem).</p><p>Low-grade gliomas have a protracted natural history, which often terminates with transformation into high-grade gliomas. The goals of treatment for patients with these tumors include prolonging overall and progression-free survival and minimizing morbidity. This requires preventing tumor enlargement and transformation into high-grade glioma and minimizing treatment-related complications.</p><p>Surgery, radiation therapy (RT), and chemotherapy all have a role in the management of these tumors, but their indolent natural history has resulted in a number of areas of uncertainty. Areas of controversy in the management of these patients include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An aggressive treatment approach including immediate surgical intervention versus a delayed intervention in patients with limited disease and symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role and timing of RT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy (ie, administered immediately after surgery versus delayed until there is evidence of recurrent or progressive disease)</p><p/><p>Most of the clinical studies that have attempted to address these questions have included different mixtures of patients with astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors, further complicating their interpretation. In addition, recent advances in the understanding of molecular markers, such as mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and the <span class=\"nowrap\">1p/19q</span> co-deletion, now also need to be taken into consideration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathologic diagnosis of gliomas&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular pathogenesis of diffuse gliomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Throughout this topic, low-grade glioma generally refers to the three most common histologic subtypes of WHO grade II gliomas that occur in the cerebral hemispheres: diffuse astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma. Historical studies also include oligoastrocytoma, a diagnosis that no longer exists for fully characterized tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The management of these tumors and of pilocytic astrocytoma (a WHO grade I glioma) is discussed here. The diagnosis and classification of low-grade gliomas is reviewed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=focal-brainstem-glioma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Focal brainstem glioma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=optic-pathway-glioma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Optic pathway glioma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncommon-brain-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncommon brain tumors&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with presumed low-grade gliomas, surgery provides tissue for histopathologic diagnosis and molecular characterization. In addition, surgical intervention can be therapeutic. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H235552481\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediate surgery is generally required for patients presenting with a large mass or extensive neurologic symptoms, both to establish the diagnosis and debulk the tumor.</p><p>For patients with a small tumor and minimal symptoms, the role of immediate surgical intervention versus delayed resection is controversial, and data are limited to observational studies. We generally favor a maximal safe resection at the time of diagnosis for all patients with a presumed low-grade glioma, based upon reviews of the literature that have found a trend toward improved survival with this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. However, there is a potential for bias in these observations since the surgical results are compared to those in patients in whom it was not possible to do a maximal resection, and resectable tumors may have a more favorable molecular profile.</p><p>An alternative more conservative approach is advocated by others for carefully selected patients with small, asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic tumors (seizures only) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. In this approach, aggressive surgery and other therapies are delayed until there is radiographic evidence of tumor growth, intractable seizures, progressive neurologic impairment, or radiological evidence of transformation to a high-grade glioma. However, a percentage of patients may no longer be candidates for surgery at the time of progression.</p><p>Data regarding these approaches are derived from observational studies, including a retrospective cohort study that sought to compare early versus delayed surgery at two adjacent regional referral centers in Norway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In this population-based study of 153 patients with presumed low-grade glioma, one center favored early maximal safe resection (performed in 86 percent) and the other favored diagnostic biopsy and watchful waiting (performed in 71 percent, with 55 percent ultimately undergoing resection). While survival was superior at the center that favored early maximal safe resection (72 versus 59 percent alive at five years; median overall survival 14.4 versus 5.8 years), this benefit likely reflects the higher rate of resection in this population (89 versus 55 percent) rather than the timing of resection. The improvement in overall survival persisted with long term follow up and adjustment for molecular tumor characteristics; 70 percent of patients had an IDH mutated tumor. Of note, about 40 percent of patients in both cohorts had presenting symptoms of headache <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurological deficits in addition to seizures, and the median age of both groups was 45 years. These are clinical characteristics that many would consider high risk and inappropriate for a watchful waiting approach, suggesting that this group of patients was not typical for low-grade glioma patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H235552558\"><span class=\"h2\">Extent of resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized trials evaluating the extent of surgery, but observational studies provide support for a more extensive resection rather than simple debulking in patients undergoing resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/5,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9-11</a>].</p><p>In the most detailed study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to assess the preoperative and postoperative tumor volume in a retrospective study of 216 patients with hemispheric low-grade gliomas operated on at a single institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Tumor volumes were used to calculate the extent of resection and correlated with patient outcomes. Multivariate analysis found that the completeness of the initial resection was the most important factor in predicting improved overall survival, while lower preoperative tumor volume correlated with increases in both progression-free survival and malignant progression-free survival.</p><p>Gross total resection is often not possible without a significant risk of serious neurological sequelae because of the diffuse infiltrative nature of these tumors, however, and a combined modality approach using adjuvant radiation therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy may be indicated, as discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5486327\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3106523768\"><span class=\"h2\">IDH-wildtype tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low-grade gliomas that lack a mutation in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (<em>IDH1</em>) or <em>IDH2</em> make up a relatively small proportion of all low-grade gliomas and carry a significantly worse prognosis compared with IDH-mutant tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Importantly, IDH-wildtype status in low-grade gliomas should be confirmed by IDH sequencing rather than relying on a negative immunohistochemical test for the most common mutant form of IDH, IDH1 R132H. Sequencing is particularly important in patients younger than 55 years of age, who have a higher likelihood of having a non-canonical mutation in <em>IDH1</em> or <em>IDH2</em>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas#H2243056697\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathologic diagnosis of gliomas&quot;, section on 'IDH1/IDH2 mutations'</a>.)</p><p>There are no randomized trials to guide treatment in patients with IDH-wildtype low-grade gliomas, and these tumors are underrepresented in historical studies of low-grade glioma, including the RTOG 9802 trial reviewed below (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive chemotherapy'</a> below).</p><p>Some of these tumors bear molecular similarity to glioblastoma (eg, <em>TERT</em> mutations, loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 10). In such cases, we typically favor treating with immediate postoperative therapy, regardless of extent of resection or other prognostic factors. We typically treat with radiation plus concurrent and adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a>, which has been shown to improve survival compared with radiation alone in patients with glioblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-postoperative-therapy-for-glioblastoma-and-anaplastic-astrocytoma#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial postoperative therapy for glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma&quot;, section on 'Glioblastoma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4073992136\"><span class=\"h2\">IDH-mutant tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As of the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the central nervous system, astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors are classified on the basis of IDH mutation status along with several other key molecular genetic alterations, rather than strictly by histopathologic features. Going forward, the diagnosis of oligoastrocytoma no longer exists for fully characterized tumors, leaving two major tumor types: diffuse astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, WHO grade II; and oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant, <span class=\"nowrap\">1p/19q-codeleted,</span> WHO grade II. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas#H89359691\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathologic diagnosis of gliomas&quot;, section on 'Diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors'</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13431714\"><span class=\"h3\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery alone is not curative in patients with low-grade glioma, and additional therapy (ie, radiation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy) is ultimately required in all patients. The optimal timing of additional therapy is uncertain, however, and the decision to proceed with immediate versus delayed postoperative therapy must be individualized. </p><p>Available data, including results of a randomized trial of early versus delayed radiation therapy (RT), suggest that early postoperative therapy prolongs progression-free survival but does not improve overall survival, and gains in disease control can be offset by side effects of therapy, some of which remain poorly studied. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Timing of radiation'</a> below.) </p><p>Factors to consider when selecting patients for immediate postoperative therapy include the presence of tumor-related symptoms and risk factors for worse outcome, which include age &ge;40 years, large preoperative tumor size (eg, &ge;5 cm), incomplete resection, astrocytic histology, elevated MIB-1 index (&gt;3 percent), and absence of a <span class=\"nowrap\">1p/19q-codeletion</span>. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis and natural history'</a> below.)</p><p>It is important to recognize, however, that individual risk factors are relative (including the age cutoff of &ge;40 years) and exist on a biological continuum. In addition, there is no single agreed-upon definition of low versus high risk, and risk has been variably defined across trials. Taking these factors into consideration, we approach the decision about immediate versus delayed postoperative therapy in the following manner for patients with IDH-mutant low-grade glioma:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For young patients (&le;40 years) who undergo complete resection of a tumor with favorable molecular features, we suggest initial observation after surgery. It is expected that these patients will eventually recur and require additional therapy at the time of progression. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For older patients with residual disease and one or more unfavorable molecular features, we suggest immediate postoperative therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who do not fall into either of these categories, the more risk factors present, the more likely we are to treat with immediate postoperative therapy.</p><p/><p>Once a patient has been selected for additional postoperative therapy, long-term follow-up results of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9802 trial indicate that the combination of RT and chemotherapy (in this case, PCV &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procarbazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lomustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lomustine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>) improves survival compared with RT alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and this is now our recommended approach and that of others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Whether certain subsets of patients derive more benefit from adjunctive chemotherapy than others remains uncertain, and histologic and molecular subgroup analyses for the RTOG 9802 trial have not been presented (and may be limited by small numbers and missing information once they are). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive chemotherapy'</a> below.) </p><p>The RTOG 9802 trial did not address whether patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">1p/19q-codeleted</span> tumors who are selected for postoperative therapy can be treated safely with chemotherapy alone and delayed RT without sacrificing overall survival. (See <a href=\"#H1066728\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy with deferred RT'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5486556\"><span class=\"h4\">Observation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A &quot;wait and see&quot; approach following initial surgery may be followed in young patients with a favorable prognosis whose and who have undergone an extensive resection for an IDH-mutant low-grade glioma, especially if molecular studies show the presence of a <span class=\"nowrap\">1p/19q-codeletion</span>. These tumors have a lower annual growth rate compared to low grade tumors without <span class=\"nowrap\">1p/19q-codeletion</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

However, only 48 percent of patients remained progression free at five years. Factors associated with a poorer prognosis included large tumor size (&ge;4 cm), astrocytoma or oligoastrocytoma histology rather than oligodendroglioma, and residual disease &ge;1 cm by MRI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation therapy (RT) is a standard component of therapy for patients with low-grade glioma, but the optimal timing is uncertain. Early versus delayed RT is associated with symptomatic improvement and prolonged progression-free but not overall survival. Technical advances in both diagnostic radiology and radiation oncology have significantly improved the planning and delivery of conformal RT.</p><p>Controversies in the use of RT for low-grade gliomas have involved the optimal timing and dose of radiation, as well as the role for adjunctive chemotherapy. Several randomized cooperative group trials reviewed below have assessed the impact of these factors on outcome. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Timing of radiation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h5\">Timing of radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of RT immediately after surgery improves progression-free but not overall survival in patients with low-grade gliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Patients with a greater likelihood of rapid disease progression or ongoing tumor-related symptoms are likely to derive the most benefit from RT immediately after recovery from surgery. High-risk features are variably defined across trials but include age &ge;40, large preoperative tumor size (eg, &ge;5 cm), incomplete resection, astrocytic histology, elevated MIB-1 index (&gt;3 percent), absence of a <span class=\"nowrap\">1p/19q-codeletion,</span> and absence of an IDH mutation. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis and natural history'</a> below.)</p><p>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 22845 trial randomly assigned 311 patients with low-grade gliomas to receive either immediate RT (54 Gy in six weeks) or no therapy until progression following initial biopsy or resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. At a median follow-up of almost eight years, immediate postoperative RT significantly prolonged the progression-free survival (median 5.4 versus 3.7 years, without postoperative RT), but did not affect overall survival (7.4 versus 7.2 years). The majority of patients in the no therapy group (65 percent) received RT at progression. </p><p>The absence of a survival benefit suggests that RT slows the progression of low-grade gliomas but does not prevent transformation into high-grade gliomas, but that RT given at the time of radiologic progression is equally effective. Although quality of life was not assessed in detail, better seizure control was observed among patients receiving postoperative RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The lack of survival benefit with immediate adjuvant RT has been used as a justification to postpone radiation until disease progression, thereby postponing or avoiding potential radiation-associated toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h5\">Dose and schedule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once it is decided to treat with RT, a dose of 50 to 54 Gy provides a reasonable balance between efficacy and toxicity for the treatment of low-grade gliomas. </p><p>Two multicenter randomized trials both failed to show a survival benefit from escalation of the dose of RT in patients with low-grade gliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In EORTC trial 22844, 379 patients with cerebral low-grade gliomas were randomly assigned to 59.4 Gy in 33 treatments or 45 Gy in 25 treatments following surgery or biopsy; they were then followed for a median of 74 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

There was no improvement in the survival rate with the higher dose of RT (85 versus 94 percent at two years and 64 versus 72 percent at five years, compared to the lower dose of RT). In addition, a higher rate of severe radiation necrosis was seen with the higher dose of RT (5.0 versus 2.5 percent).</p><p/><p>Other RT approaches that have been evaluated for incompletely resected lesions include hyperfractionated RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], proton RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>], and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

In an update of the data with a median follow-up time of 11.9 years, this difference became significant, with post-RT PCV conferring a survival advantage over RT alone (median overall survival 13.3 versus 7.8 years, HR 0.59, p = 0.03) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Median progression-free survival was also prolonged in patients who received PCV (10.4 versus 4.0 years, p = 0.002). The incidence of grade 3 and 4 hematologic toxicity was 8 and 3 percent in the RT alone arm compared with 51 and 15 percent in the RT plus PCV arm; there were no treatment-related deaths and no cases of secondary leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The survival benefit conferred by PCV was present in all histologic subtypes, but the magnitude of the effect was greater in patients with oligodendroglioma (n = 101; HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23-0.82) and oligoastrocytoma (n = 77; HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32-1.0) than in those with astrocytoma (n = 46, HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.40-1.34), and small numbers of patients in each subgroup preclude definitive conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>Post hoc molecular analysis of the RTOG 9802 trial has been limited by small numbers and incomplete data. Similar to the analysis of histologic subgroups, it is currently unclear whether the benefit of PCV is limited to specific molecular subsets of low-grade glioma patients.

As discussed below, both regimens have activity in low-grade gliomas, but only PCV has been shown to improve survival in a randomized trial in patients with low-grade glioma. Temozolomide has generally been preferred over the PCV regimen for the last decade based upon its ease of administration, better patient tolerance, and more consistent availability in some regions. In addition, an interim analysis of the CATNON study of patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">1p/19q-non-codeleted</span> anaplastic glioma found that 12 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide improved survival over radiation alone (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.45-0.93; five-year overall survival 56 versus 44 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Part of the rationale for such an approach is to avoid potential short and long term toxicities of radiation for as long as possible. The toxicity of RT may be of particular concern in patients with large tumors and thereby large radiation fields.</p><p>Oligodendroglial tumors with a <span class=\"nowrap\">1p/19q-codeletion</span> are markedly more sensitive to chemotherapy than other low grade gliomas. The chemosensitivity of oligodendrogliomas was initially demonstrated with a PCV regimen in patients who had recurred or progressed after RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/33-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-38</a>]. These observations led to the evaluation of PCV as part of a combined modality approach for the initial management of these patients (eg, RTOG 9802, discussed above), as well as to its use in the treatment of recurrent disease. Subsequent studies showed that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> is also highly active [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. </p><p>The most robust data on single-modality treatment of low-grade glioma come from the EORTC 22033-26033 trial, in which 477 patients with high-risk low-grade glioma (defined as age &gt;40 years, progressive disease, tumor &gt;5 cm, tumor crossing midline, or neurologic symptoms) were randomized to receive either 12 cycles of postoperative dose-intense <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> (75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m2</span> daily for 21 days out of 28) or radiotherapy (50.4 Gy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

They are distinguished from diffuse astrocytomas and oligodendroglial tumors because of their well-defined character, earlier age of onset, lack of invasiveness, and favorable prognosis in many patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Because of the circumscribed nature of these tumors, they are usually curable if completely resected; thus the goal of surgery should be complete removal. However, multicentric spread can occur, especially with hypothalamic tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Malignant transformation of pilocytic astrocytomas to HGGs occurs in less than 5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas#H3842180574\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathologic diagnosis of gliomas&quot;, section on 'Pilocytic astrocytoma'</a>.)</p><p>Surgical resection is the standard initial approach in patients with pilocytic astrocytomas. Even if resection is incomplete, RT and chemotherapy are usually withheld until there is evidence of tumor growth. RT at the time of diagnosis may be required for patients in whom surgery is not feasible. RT is also indicated in those patients with pilocytic astrocytomas who have progressive disease following surgical resection. When RT is recommended, an involved field fractionated course to 54 Gy is most commonly used.</p><p>Pilocytic astrocytomas have a much better prognosis than low-grade astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/75,79-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,79-83</a>]. With complete surgical resection, pilocytic astrocytomas are curable; thus, the goal of surgery should be complete removal. Even incomplete tumor resection is often associated with prolonged survival. As an example, in a series of 361 pediatric patients with LGGs treated at a single institution over a 22 year period, 63 percent of patients had pilocytic astrocytoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. The 10 and 20-year overall survival rates for the entire series were 87 and 82 percent, respectively. However, a substantial number of long-term survivors did experience adverse outcomes including for example intellectual impairment, endocrine abnormalities, hearing loss, and blindness.</p><p>In another series of 51 patients all of whom had pilocytic astrocytoma, 82 percent of patients were alive after ten years and 89 percent of survivors were fully active [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Ten-year survival was higher in those who underwent gross total or radical subtotal tumor resection (100 versus 74 percent, in patients with a lesser resection or biopsy alone). Transformation to a more anaplastic tumor occurs in approximately 10 percent of patients and can be associated with rapid disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. </p><p>The combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a> was well tolerated and showed some evidence of activity in a small single-arm study that included 16 children with recurrent pilocytic astrocytoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>]. As many pilocytic astrocytomas harbor <em>BRAF</em> alterations, therapies targeting <em>BRAF</em> and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway are also under investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-glioma/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Surgery, radiation therapy (RT), and chemotherapy all are useful in selected situations, although there are multiple areas of uncertainty concerning the optimal treatment of these patients.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate surgery is generally required for patients presenting with a large mass or extensive neurologic symptoms, both to establish the diagnosis and debulk the tumor. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with transient symptoms and a small tumor not creating a mass effect on adjacent structures, we suggest surgical resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, careful observation is an alternative in these patients. Subsequent surgical resection is indicated when there is evidence of accelerated tumor growth or transformation to a high-grade glioma, intractable seizures, or progressive neurologic impairment. (See <a href=\"#H235552481\" class=\"local\">'Timing of resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients undergoing surgical resection, we suggest maximal safe resection rather than simple debulking (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H235552558\" class=\"local\">'Extent of resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery alone is not curative in patients with low-grade glioma, and additional therapy (ie, radiation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy) is ultimately required in all patients. The optimal timing of additional therapy is uncertain, however. Factors to consider when selecting patients for immediate postoperative therapy include the presence of tumor-related symptoms and the spectrum of clinical and molecular prognostic factors. Importantly, individual prognostic factors are relative (including the age cut off of &ge;40 year) and exist on a biological continuum. (See <a href=\"#H13431714\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For young patients (age &le;40 to 45 years) who undergo complete resection of a tumor with favorable molecular features (eg, isocitrate dehydrogenase [IDH] mutation and <span class=\"nowrap\">1p/19q-codeletion),</span> we suggest initial observation after surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). It is expected that these patients will eventually recur and require additional therapy at the time of progression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with an IDH-wildtype tumor or multiple other poor prognostic factors (eg, residual disease, age &gt;40 to 45 years, neurologic deficits, large lesion with mass effect), we suggest immediate postoperative therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3106523768\" class=\"local\">'IDH-wildtype tumors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who do not fall into either of these categories, the more risk factors present, the more likely we are to treat with immediate postoperative therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When patients with low-grade glioma are selected for postoperative therapy (whether immediate or delayed), we recommend radiation therapy plus chemotherapy rather than either modality alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3106523768\" class=\"local\">'IDH-wildtype tumors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4073992136\" class=\"local\">'IDH-mutant tumors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Experts, including the authors of this topic, have not reached consensus on the choice of PCV (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=procarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procarbazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lomustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lomustine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>) versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> as adjunctive chemotherapy, and treatment selection should be individualized. Some favor PCV, particularly for oligodendroglial tumors, because it is the regimen proven to improve survival in a randomized trial in patients with low-grade glioma; others prefer temozolomide because it is easier to administer, better tolerated, and has shown efficacy in a randomized trial of patients with grade III, <span class=\"nowrap\">1p/19q-non-codeleted</span> anaplastic glioma. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive chemotherapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy all can have a role in the management of patients who recur after initial therapy, and their application needs to be individualized based upon the site and extent of recurrence, along with the history of prior treatment. (See <a href=\"#H235552771\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pilocytic astrocytomas have a more favorable prognosis compared with diffuse astrocytomas. Surgical resection is used for the diagnosis and initial treatment, and gross total resection can be curative. Radiation therapy is typically reserved for the subsequent management of symptomatic patients who are not resectable or in whom progressive disease develops.
