CS most often occurs as a manifestation of systemic sarcoidosis, although isolated CS can occur in patients who do not have evidence of sarcoidosis in other organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Yet, commonly used clinical criteria require the diagnosis of extracardiac disease in order to establish the diagnosis of CS in the absence of having a positive endomyocardial biopsy. While endomyocardial biopsy provides a high specificity for diagnosing CS, this invasive test has a limited sensitivity. Furthermore, there is limited understanding of disease progression and a lack of consensus on the optimal methods for disease detection.</p><p>This topic will discuss the clinical manifestations of CS and provide an overview of how to evaluate patients with suspected CS. Management and prognosis of CS and diagnosis and management of systemic sarcoidosis are discussed separately.

CS can affect patients of all racial backgrounds and ages, with an average age at presentation of approximately 50 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of CS among patients with systemic sarcoidosis has been reported to be 20 to 27 percent in the United States and as high as 58 percent in Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Yet, autopsy studies indicate that subclinical cardiac involvement may be present in up to 70 percent of cases. In the United States, 13 to 25 percent of deaths from sarcoidosis have been attributed to CS, while in Japan, 47 to 85 percent of deaths from sarcoidosis have been attributed to cardiac involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Isolated CS may occur in up to 25 percent of CS cases, and thus the absence of extracardiac sarcoidosis does not rule out CS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>].</p><p>Several reports have suggested that the incidence of CS may be increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]; however, it is unclear if such an increase is due to a true increase in the prevalence of disease or to increased awareness and detection of this condition. </p><p>The prevalence of pulmonary sarcoidosis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1307897246\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sarcoidosis is a heterogeneous disorder of unknown etiology whose signature lesions are noncaseating granulomata. Sarcoidosis may involve any part of the heart. While the ventricular myocardium is most commonly affected, involvement by the atria, papillary muscles, valves, coronary arteries, and pericardium has been described. Similar to other involved organs, cardiac disease generally progresses from areas of focal inflammation to scar. However, the natural history of CS is not well characterized and is highly variable. Some individuals may only have a small area of inflammation or scar and will not experience any significant clinical sequelae. On the other hand, some patients will progress to develop a pattern of extensive inflammation and scar. Given the limited data on how this disease progresses, it may be preferable to refer to different patterns of CS rather than stages, as use of stages implies a linear progression across different stages.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1340435187\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most frequent clinical manifestations of CS are atrioventricular (AV) block, arrhythmias, heart failure (HF), and sudden cardiac death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2962139928\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms and signs of CS include palpitations, presyncope, syncope, fatigue, dyspnea, orthopnea, and sudden cardiac death. Palpitations may be caused by either supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias. Presyncope or syncope can be caused by AV block, ventricular tachycardia, or supraventricular tachycardia. Fatigue, dyspnea, and orthopnea can reflect HF caused by CS. However, fatigue and dyspnea are nonspecific symptoms that may also result from lung disease in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis.</p><p>By contrast, angina symptoms are generally considered more suggestive of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD), as CS only rarely causes angina. (See <a href=\"#H364103430\" class=\"local\">'Coronary artery disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4096267240\"><span class=\"h2\">Key manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key clinical manifestations of CS are conduction system disease, tachyarrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, HF, and rarely CAD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3286366443\"><span class=\"h3\">Arrhythmias</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2541698028\"><span class=\"h4\">Conduction system disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AV block is the most common clinical presentation in patients with clinically evident CS. In a retrospective study of 110 patients with histologically confirmed CS, symptomatic heart block was present in 44 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>]. Complete AV block occurs at a younger age in patients with CS than in individuals with complete AV block due to other etiologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Prolongation of the PR interval (first-degree AV block) due to disease of the AV node or bundle of His and intraventricular conduction defects is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and may progress. Thus, conduction system disease may initially be silent and then progress to complete AV block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and cause syncope or even sudden death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-atrioventricular-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of atrioventricular block&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Third degree (complete) atrioventricular block&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4256061904\"><span class=\"h4\">Tachyarrhythmias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias are both common in CS.</p><p>Ventricular arrhythmias (sustained or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular premature beats [VPBs]) are the second most common clinical presentation of CS, occurring in approximately 30 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These arise when sarcoid granulomas within the myocardium become foci for abnormal automaticity, or may disrupt ventricular activation and recovery, causing re-entrant arrhythmias. Scar within the myocardium may also cause re-entrant arrhythmias. </p><p>Supraventricular arrhythmias seen with CS include paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and sinus arrest secondary to granulomatous involvement of the sinus node. In a retrospective study that included 100 patients with definite or probable CS, the prevalence of supraventricular arrhythmias over a mean follow-up of 5.8 years was 32 percent, with atrial fibrillation being the most common arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The presence of left atrial enlargement by echocardiography was most strongly associated with the development of supraventricular arrhythmias. A high prevalence of atrial arrhythmias in CS was also observed in a study evaluating 135 patients who had ambulatory electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring; patients with systemic sarcoidosis who had late gadolinium enhancement by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging had a threefold increase in the prevalence of atrial arrhythmias compared with those who did not have any evidence of cardiac involvement (36 versus 12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1783310326\"><span class=\"h3\">Sudden cardiac death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sudden death due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias or conduction block accounts for 25 to 65 percent of deaths caused by CS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/7,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16-18</a>]. Some patients with known systemic sarcoidosis develop symptomatic or electrocardiographically evident arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities prior to sarcoid-related sudden death, assisting diagnosis and therapeutic management. However, sudden death can occur in the absence of symptoms or a previous cardiac event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Thus, a key diagnostic challenge is to identify individuals at risk for sudden death to enable preventive therapies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis#H3431833649\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of cardiac sarcoidosis&quot;, section on 'Management of conduction disease and arrhythmias'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3066357251\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiomyopathy and heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Presence of cardiomyopathy or HF in a patient with known extracardiac sarcoidosis should prompt an evaluation for CS. HF is less common than arrhythmia at initial presentation and is the first clinical manifestation of CS in fewer than 20 percent of cases. However, CS may even be diagnosed after transplant in the explanted hearts of patients thought to have an idiopathic cardiomyopathy. </p><p>CS is a cause of cardiomyopathy, which may manifest with symptoms and signs of HF (eg, orthopnea, edema). CS can cause either a dilated cardiomyopathy (with dilated left ventricular [LV] volumes and depressed LV ejection fraction [LVEF], which can lead to HF with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF]) or a restrictive cardiomyopathy (with normal LV volumes and preserved LVEF), which can lead to HF with preserved ejection fraction. </p><p>Fewer data are available on the prevalence and clinical significance of right ventricular dysfunction attributable to CS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Some patients with CS present with signs of predominantly right-sided HF, which can be caused by sarcoid-related inflammation or scar affecting the right ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] or less commonly secondary to CS involving the tricuspid valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Right HF due to CS involving the right ventricle should be distinguished from other causes of right HF including pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung disease.

However, patients with CS may also be more likely to have CAD.</p><p>As discussed below, CS should be distinguished from ischemic heart disease in patients with symptoms consistent with both disorders. However, it is important to acknowledge that CS and atherosclerotic CAD often coexist. Data are lacking on the frequency of CAD in patients with CS.

However, none of these features are specific for CS. The 12-lead ECG has low sensitivity (generally reported as &lt;50 percent) for detection of CS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>A chest radiograph is not required to diagnose CS, but it is a component of the diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis.

LGE most commonly represents scar, although significant inflammation can also result in expansion of the extracellular space leading to LGE. Of note, there is no specific pattern of LGE that is pathognomonic for CS, so careful interpretation in the context of other clinical features is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The following are typical LGE patterns in patients with CS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/19,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,44,45</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multifocal areas of LGE (as opposed to a single area)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subepicardial and midmyocardial LGE (ie, noninfarct pattern), although some patients may have subendocardial involvement in a pattern similar to myocardial infarction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct LGE extension from the LV, across the interventricular segment, into the right ventricle</p><p/><p>The presence of increased T2 weighted signal, a marker of increased water content, can be used to identify areas of increased inflammation, although this technique is technically challenging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and its role in the diagnosis of CS has not been established.

These cardiac implantable electric devices may cause imaging artifacts, which may interfere with interpretation, and some devices, including most current ICDs, are not magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatible.

Importantly, FDG uptake by the heart is not specific for sarcoidosis, and uptake of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG is seen in other inflammatory myocardial diseases and hibernating myocardium. For this reason, in the appropriate clinical context, the presence of a resting perfusion defect that has increased FDG uptake requires ruling out obstructive CAD.

An EMB is recommended if the patient lacks histologic confirmation of noncaseating granulomas from any other source.

Its use is limited by false negative results owing to sampling error that may occur due to the patchy distribution of disease. EMB is most commonly performed from the right ventricle at the midmyocardial level, while disease involvement is more common in the basal septum and lateral LV wall, regions that are difficult to biopsy. Given the restricted area of right ventricular midmyocardium that is safely accessible to traditional transvenous cardiac biopsy, there is only a limited role for using CMR or PET findings to guide biopsy. However, during electrophysiology (EP) study when there is suspected CS (see <a href=\"#H3980403966\" class=\"local\">'Electrophysiologic study'</a> below), electroanatomic mapping can be used to identify areas of low voltage which may correspond to granuloma and may be targeted for biopsy, thereby increasing the diagnostic yield.

However, it is important to be aware of myocardial perfusion abnormalities that may be detected in patients evaluated for CAD that may instead be caused by CS. Among patients with CS, rest nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging findings include a resting perfusion defect, with the most common locations being the basal anteroseptal, basal lateral, or basal inferior wall. Such perfusion defects, which represent scar or inflammation compressing the microvasculature, may improve following immunosuppressive therapy.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-atrioventricular-block#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of atrioventricular block&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiologic AV block'</a>.)</p><p>The differential diagnosis of CS also includes other etiologies of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, as well as myocarditis. Distinguishing between myocarditis and sarcoidosis is partially based upon clinical presentation, as myocarditis may have a viral prodrome associated with fever and myalgias. Myocarditis is also more likely to present with elevated cardiac biomarkers than CS. Giant cell myocarditis, often presenting with AV block, unstable ventricular arrhythmias, and acute heart failure (HF), should be considered particularly when there is a more acute or fulminant clinical presentation. Patients with myocarditis may have evidence of scar on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indistinguishable from that seen with CS. Endomyocardial biopsy may be required to distinguish these conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endomyocardial-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endomyocardial biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) can also mimic CS (and vice versa). ARVC is often isolated to the right ventricle and spares the septum, while patients with CS and right heart myocardial involvement often also have significant septal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> left heart infiltration. While some patients can have left-sided arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, the pattern of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on MRI between this condition and CS is different (eg, left-sided arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy often has a large amount of circumferential and often contiguous subepicardial LGE). While not a criterion on the 2010 Task Force Criteria for ARVC, the presence of significant fat in the myocardium would favor the diagnosis of ARVC. ARVC may also have a familial component as well as characteristic electrocardiographic (ECG) findings, both features which are not present in CS. It is important to recognize that the 12-lead ECG in patients with CS may also meet many of the ECG criteria for ARVC. One of the most useful distinguishing ECG features is that first-degree or higher AV block is extremely uncommon in ARVC but is a common feature of CS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: Diagnostic evaluation and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>On imaging, CS may present with areas of increased wall thickness or areas of wall thinning and even aneurysm, and thus must be distinguished from other conditions with similar abnormalities. Fabry disease, a rare inherited disorder of fat metabolism, can present with concentric or asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, and on MRI often has midwall LGE of the basal inferolateral wall (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease#H426803267\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fabry disease: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of cardiac disease&quot;, section on 'Cardiac tests'</a>). While such LGE findings can also be seen in CS, CS is more likely to have multifocal LGE and focal areas of left ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular noncompaction may present with ventricular arrhythmia and increased wall thickness much like CS, but in noncompaction increased trabeculations of the ventricular myocardium are detected on echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Isolated left ventricular noncompaction&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>). Cardiac iron overload from hereditary hemochromatosis can present with conduction disease, arrhythmia, and HF much like CS, but hemochromatosis may be accompanied by diabetes and bronze skin and can be diagnosed by reduced T2* signal on CMR (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with suspected iron overload&quot;</a>). In rare cases, CS may also resemble end-stage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy where there is significant replacement fibrosis of the left ventricle. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H18608369\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Right HF due to CS involving the right ventricle should be distinguished from other causes of right HF such as right HF secondary to left HF (which may be caused by CS) and right HF caused by pulmonary sarcoidosis (cor pulmonale). (See <a href=\"#H3066357251\" class=\"local\">'Cardiomyopathy and heart failure'</a> above.)</p><p>Cor pulmonale secondary to pulmonary sarcoidosis should be distinguished from CS involving the right ventricle. Pulmonary hypertension is a complication in some patients (estimated at 3 to 20 percent) with pulmonary sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>] and often occurs in the absence of CS. Some patients with pulmonary hypertension may develop right HF. Patients who have pulmonary sarcoidosis with cor pulmonale can have areas of focal LGE on MRI at the right ventricular insertion points. Such findings are well described in patients with pulmonary hypertension and should be distinguished from CS where the LGE involvement is more extensive, and often extends beyond the insertion points to involve the right and left ventricles.</p><p>While most patients with CS have subepicardial or midwall LGE involvement on MRI, some can have subendocardial LGE, which is a pattern most commonly seen in patients who have had prior myocardial infarctions. Similarly, CS may be detected on <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) by a rest perfusion defect associated with increased FDG uptake. However, such a pattern can also be seen in patients with hibernating myocardium, and thus the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease should be ruled out in such scenarios.
