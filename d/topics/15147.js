Extended right hemicolectomy refers to extension of the distal resection margin to include the distal transverse colon up to the splenic flexure. </p><p>The techniques used to perform right and extended right colectomy are reviewed here. Left colectomy is presented separately.

The ascending and descending colon are retroperitoneal, while the transverse colon, which extends from the hepatic flexure to the splenic flexure, is intraperitoneal. The sigmoid colon continues from the descending colon, ending where the teniae converge to form the rectum. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20137558\"><span class=\"h2\">Arterial supply</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The right colic artery and the ileocolic artery provide the principle blood supply to the right colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73756\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73756 \">figure 2</a>). The marginal artery of Drummond and the arc of Riolan provide collateral blood vessels. Typically, the blood supply of the transverse colon is excellent provided the marginal artery is not damaged. Variability in the arterial anastomoses occurs, which is an important point when performing a segmental resection. Two sites of tenuous perfusion are the splenic flexure (Griffith's point) and distal descending colon (Sudeck's point). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intestinal-ischemia-in-adults#H1190363137\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intestinal ischemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Intestinal vascular anatomy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20137593\"><span class=\"h2\">Venous and lymphatic drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The venous drainage of the right colon is through the superior mesenteric vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81960 \">figure 3</a>). The lymphatics drain via the corresponding arterial supply (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58219 \">figure 4</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20139022\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR COLON RESECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malignant, premalignant, and benign diseases are indications for a right colectomy and include a right colon cancer (eg, cecum, ascending colon), appendiceal cancer, large adenomas, right-sided diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">ischemia/infarction,</span> infection, trauma, and cecal volvulus. The indications for an extended right colectomy include a cancer located between the hepatic flexure and mid-transverse colon, synchronous ascending and transverse colon cancers, and multiple adenomas, which may or may not be part of a genetic syndrome.

The anatomy of the colon and its blood supply should be verified, noting any anatomic variations or possibly any congenital anomalies (eg, malrotation).</p><p>For patients with abdominal trauma, the abdomen is packed and systematically examined removing the packs in turn. Bleeding is controlled first, followed by control of gastrointestinal leakage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient#H197204297\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic gastrointestinal injury in the adult patient&quot;, section on 'Abdominal exploration'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with cancer, this evaluation includes an assessment of local, regional, and distant disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The abdomen is explored for evidence of anomalies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> metastatic disease, including peritoneal implants, hepatic metastases, and distant nodal metastases. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary tumor is palpated to confirm its location. Local and regional resectability is determined by assessing tumor invasion into the abdominal wall, gallbladder, liver, stomach, vena cava, duodenum, pancreas, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> superior mesenteric vessels. The entire colon is palpated to identify synchronous colonic lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186830016\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTENT OF RESECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The selection of the operative procedure (eg, right or extended right colectomy) is based upon the location of the lesion, malignant or benign indication, blood supply, and venous and lymphatic drainage of the colon. The blood supply, venous return, and lymphatic drainage of the colon are shown in the attached figures and are critical in planning a colectomy. (See <a href=\"#H20137535\" class=\"local\">'Colon anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115081012\"><span class=\"h2\">Right colectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neoplastic lesions located in the appendix, cecum, and ascending colon, and benign lesions (eg, cecal diverticulum, inflammatory bowel disease) limited to the right colon can be resected by a standard right colectomy. The resection extends from the distal ileum and can extend to the mid-transverse colon; this involves isolating and dividing the ileocolic, right colic and either the right or hepatic branch of the middle colic artery and vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70995\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70995 \">figure 5</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115081019\"><span class=\"h2\">Right extended colectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malignant lesions located in the hepatic flexure or proximal to the mid-transverse colon, and benign inflammatory conditions extending to the mid-transverse colon may be resected with an extended right colectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51067\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51067 \">figure 6</a>). An extended right colectomy includes the resection of the distal transverse colon and sometimes the splenic flexure, and involves ligating the ileocolic, right colic, and middle colic vessels. An anastomosis is avoided in areas of unreliable blood supply (eg, mid-ascending colon or splenic flexure). An option to the extended right colectomy for proximal to mid-transverse colon cancers is a transverse colectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F69341\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69341 \">figure 7</a>). The caveat of this procedure is the distal and proximal ends of the resected bowel need to be well mobilized and assessed carefully to ensure a tension free and well-vascularized anastomosis; hence, the extended right colectomy may be preferred in these settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115081026\"><span class=\"h2\">Mesenteric resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extent of the mesenteric resection also varies according to the indication for surgery. For example, when performing a colectomy for non-neoplastic disease, mesenteric vessels may be divided closer to the mesenteric border of the colon, as it is unnecessary to resect draining lymph nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F98812\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98812 \">figure 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F98859\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98859 \">figure 9</a>). However, for settings of severe mesenteric inflammation (eg, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease) and thickening of the mesentery near the bowel wall, a more radical mesenteric dissection may be warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-and-extended-right-colectomy-open-technique/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. When colectomies are performed for malignancy, the mesenteric vessels are ligated close to their root for optimal resection of lymphovascular tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F106973\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106973 \">figure 10</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115081033\"><span class=\"h2\">Omental resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The omentum is dissected off the transverse colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F75897\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75897 \">figure 11</a>) or divided at the distal bowel resection margin and the proximal portion removed for ascending colon, hepatic flexure, and transverse colon cancers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H451980\"><span class=\"h1\">MOBILIZING THE RIGHT COLON</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two approaches to resecting the right colon, one begins laterally by mobilizing the colon and progresses medially, while the other begins medially by identifying the lymphovascular bundle and progresses laterally. The approach is at the discretion of the surgeon.</p><p>In the lateral to medial approach, the mesentery is thoroughly mobilized prior to vascular division. This allows for accurate identification of the root of the mesentery, the retroperitoneal duodenum, and the right ureter prior to dissection in the mesenteric root and division of the vessels. The medial to lateral technique has been used primarily in laparoscopic surgery where vascular ligation prior to mobilization is necessary in order to maintain necessary traction and exposure of the mesenteric structures; however, this approach is also easily applied in the open setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186830023\"><span class=\"h2\">Lateral to medial approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lateral to medial approach begins by mobilizing the right colon by first dividing the lateral attachments of the colon and developing the retromesenteric plane in a lateral to medial fashion. This approach is performed for both malignant and benign right colon diseases. </p><p>The general principles for performing a right or extended right colectomy, beginning with the mobilization of the colon, include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-and-extended-right-colectomy-open-technique/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retract the colon medially and divide the lateral peritoneal attachments of the cecum and ascending colon along the white line of Toldt. The peritoneum and the colon are gently separated from the loose areolar tissue by finger dissection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70302\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70302 \">figure 12</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid injury to the duodenum, right ureter, and gonadal vessels. These structures should remain posterior and lateral to the right colon, underneath an intact retroperitoneal fascia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54457\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54457 \">figure 13</a>). Dissection is carried out between the posterior aspect of the right colon mesentery and Gerota's fascia, taking care to avoid excessive traction on the duodenum. Injury to the duodenum can occur during hepatic flexure mobilization. This usually results from excessive caudal and medial retraction of the colon during attempts to bring the superior aspect of the hepatic flexure into view, or from overly aggressive blunt dissection of the retroperitoneal structures including the duodenum off the posterior aspect of the transverse colon mesentery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F57463\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57463 \">figure 14</a>). Some degree of fusion may exist between Toldt's retroperitoneal fascia and the mesentery, making dissection precarious, particularly around Gerota's fascia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Divide the right renocolic ligament using electrocautery. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissect distally along the colon until the gastrocolic ligament is encountered. The gastrocolic ligament is a portion of the greater omentum, extends from the greater curvature of the stomach to the transverse colon, and forms the anterior portion of the lesser sac (omental bursa). It is inferior and parallel to the stomach and is the left continuation of the transverse mesocolon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F75897\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75897 \">figure 11</a>). Once the lesser sac is opened, the gastrocolic ligament is divided from left to right, completing mobilization of the hepatic flexure. The duodenum and head of the pancreas are now exposed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F85980\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85980 \">figure 15</a>). Any remaining attachments between the right colon mesentery and anterolateral portion of the second and third part of the duodenum are divided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Release the terminal ileum by dividing the fold of Treves on its antimesenteric border.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ligate the lymphovascular pedicle and resect the bowel.

One may doubly ligate the larger vessels with a nonabsorbable (ie, silk) or a slowly dissolving (ie, polyglycolic acid) suture. Single ligatures are used for small to medium-size vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73546\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73546 \">figure 16</a>). Energy devices may also be used to ligate and divide appropriately sized vessels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resect the mesentery by sequentially clamping and tying or with the use of energy devices (eg, LigaSure, Enseal) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73546\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73546 \">figure 16</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53575\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53575 \">figure 17</a>). In cases of right colectomy for Crohn's disease where the mesentery is thick and friable, we often find the clamp and tie technique superior. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186830037\"><span class=\"h1\">ILEOCOLONIC ANASTOMOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Options for restoring bowel continuity include a side-to-side or an end-to-side ileocolic anastomosis, which is performed with a stapling device or hand-sewn. Experience, surgeon's preference, and availability of equipment dictate the type of anastomosis a surgeon performs in a given situation. Stapling the anastomosis requires less time to perform and offers the potential for reduced fecal contamination.</p><p>There appears to be no significant advantage of a stapled anastomosis versus a hand-sewn one for outcomes that include mortality, overall dehiscence, clinical and radiographic leaks, hemorrhage, and wound infection. A meta-analysis of nine randomized trials that included 1233 adults undergoing elective colorectal surgery found insufficient evidence to demonstrate superiority of stapled over hand-sewn anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-and-extended-right-colectomy-open-technique/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Stricture rate was, however, significantly higher for stapled versus hand-sewn anastomosis (40 of 500 patients [8 percent] versus 10 of 496 patients [2 percent]).</p><p>These findings cannot be generalized to patients with inflammatory bowel disease, as there were only 94 patients (9 percent) with Crohn's disease. Limitations of these trials include the lack of description of the type of hand-sewn anastomosis (one layer versus two layers) and lack of comparison of sewing materials, which may contribute to the higher leak rates with hand-sewn anastomoses. The difference in clinical leak rates was small. There were no data on the outcomes of patients with leaks. Given these limitations and the equivalence of the two approaches for all other outcomes evaluated, we feel that the anastomotic technique should depend on the surgeon's preference, experience, and availability of equipment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-anastomotic-complications-of-colorectal-surgery#H800363\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of anastomotic complications of colorectal surgery&quot;, section on 'Dehiscence and leaks'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with Crohn's disease, the risk of recurrence of disease is not influenced by the approach used for bowel anastomosis. A randomized trial of 139 patients with Crohn's disease found no difference in symptomatic or endoscopic recurrence rates at 12 months for patients undergoing a stapled side-to-side ileocolic anastomosis compared with a hand-sewn end-to-end ileocolic anastomosis (22.7 versus 21.9 percent and 37.9 versus 42.5 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-and-extended-right-colectomy-open-technique/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186830044\"><span class=\"h2\">Stapled side-to-side functional end-to-end anastomosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the bowel is very thick, hand-sewn techniques are preferred.

We perform a two-layer anastomosis using an inner running absorbable suture and outer, interrupted nonabsorbable sutures. </p><p>The technical steps when performing a hand-sewn end-to-end anastomosis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ileum and transverse colon are divided using a scalpel, scissors, or monopolar electrocautery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F59880\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59880 \">figure 22</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Cheatle slit is made in the antimesenteric border of the ileum to accommodate any size discrepancy between the ileum and colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53083\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53083 \">figure 28</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ileum and colon are aligned end-to-end, ensuring that their mesenteries are not twisted, and stay sutures placed in the antimesenteric and mesenteric borders of these bowel loops in preparation for suturing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F64854\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64854 \">figure 29</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The outer, posterior layer is approximated by placing interrupted Lembert seromuscular nonabsorbable sutures approximately 3 to 4 mm apart. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The inner, posterior layer is performed using a full-thickness, running, absorbable suture starting from the middle of the anastomosis and proceeding outwards in either direction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F64854\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64854 \">figure 29</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Connell-type sutures are utilized to transition to and complete the superficial inner layer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76648\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76648 \">figure 30</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anterior outer layer is approximated using interrupted Lembert seromuscular nonabsorbable sutures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67600\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67600 \">figure 31</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11450188\"><span class=\"h1\">ABDOMINAL CLOSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After completion of the ileocolic anastomosis and closure of the mesenteric defect, the abdominal cavity may be irrigated with sterile saline and suctioned dry. Hemostasis is confirmed and omentum is positioned over the anastomosis and under the incision. The fascia and skin are closed in standard fashion. It is not necessary to place drainage catheters following a right colectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-abdominal-wall-closure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of abdominal wall closure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186830132\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of right colectomy include anastomotic leak, abdominopelvic abscess, fistula, hemorrhage, bowel obstruction, and wound infection, as well as complications of general anesthesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-intra-abdominal-pelvic-and-genitourinary-complications-of-colorectal-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of intra-abdominal, pelvic, and genitourinary complications of colorectal surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20138659\"><span class=\"h2\">Preventing complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several critical structures that must not be damaged during the colectomy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injury to the right ureter or gonadal vessels &ndash; When incising the lateral peritoneal attachments of the cecum and ascending colon, the operating surgeon must be keenly aware of the location of the right ureter and right gonadal vessels. Injury to these structures is avoided by dissecting anteromedial to them within the areolar plane along the white line of Toldt (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54457\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54457 \">figure 13</a>). (See <a href=\"#H186830023\" class=\"local\">'Lateral to medial approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injury to the duodenum &ndash; Injury to the duodenum can occur during hepatic flexure mobilization. This usually results from excessive caudal and medial retraction of the colon during attempts to bring the superior aspect of the hepatic flexure into view, or from overly aggressive blunt dissection of the retroperitoneal structures including the duodenum off the posterior aspect of the transverse colon mesentery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F57463\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57463 \">figure 14</a>). (See <a href=\"#H186830023\" class=\"local\">'Lateral to medial approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Venous bleeding &ndash; When ligating the middle colic vessels, the surgeon must avoid excessive upward traction, as this may cause avulsion of a large collateral branch between the middle colic vein and inferior pancreaticoduodenal vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81960 \">figure 3</a>). The most effective method of obtaining hemostasis if bleeding occurs in this area is to hold pressure for a period to allow the anesthesia team time to prepare for significant blood loss. If pressure alone is insufficient, one may carefully place figure-of-eight sutures incorporating the point of injury. Attempting to clamp and tie the injured vessel can cause further avulsion and hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H186830030\" class=\"local\">'Medial to lateral approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadvertent ligation of the superior mesenteric artery &ndash; The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) must not be mistaken for the right colic artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73756\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73756 \">figure 2</a>). The surgeon should lift the right and transverse colon in a cephalad direction and visualize and palpate the ileocolic vessels arising from the root of the mesentery, traversing to the terminal ileum and cecum. The superior mesenteric vessels are located medial to the ileocolic trunk. Ligation of the SMA will result in bowel infarction. (See <a href=\"#H186830030\" class=\"local\">'Medial to lateral approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive tension on the anastomosis &ndash; Failure to divide a sufficient amount of the gastrocolic ligament distally can lead to suboptimal mobility of the transverse colon and, consequently, undue tension on the ileocolic anastomosis. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3842724995\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The resection extends from the distal ileum to a point between the distal ascending colon and the mid-transverse colon, and involves isolating and dividing the ileocolic artery and possibly the right colic artery, and either the right or hepatic branch of the middle colic artery and vein. (See <a href=\"#H186830016\" class=\"local\">'Extent of resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neoplastic lesions located in the hepatic flexure or in the proximal to mid-transverse colon, and benign inflammatory conditions extending to the mid-transverse colon may be resected with an <strong>extended right colectomy </strong>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51067\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51067 \">figure 6</a>). An extended right colectomy includes the resection of the distal transverse colon and sometimes the splenic flexure, and involves ligating the ileocolic and middle colic vessels. (See <a href=\"#H186830016\" class=\"local\">'Extent of resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The continuity of the bowel is restored by an ileocolic anastomosis, which is performed by a stapled or hand-sewn technique, depending on the preference of the surgeon. There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate superiority of stapled over hand-sewn anastomosis. In the setting of thickened bowel and inflammation, we suggest a hand-sewn rather than stapled anastomosis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
