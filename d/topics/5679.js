A detailed discussion of the pathogenesis of drug allergy and an approach to the diagnosis and management of drug allergies are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An approach to the patient with drug allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CATEGORIES OF ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An adverse drug reaction is a general term referring to any untoward reaction to a medication. Adverse drug reactions may be broadly divided into two types, type A and type B (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F51797\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51797 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109975714\"><span class=\"h2\">Type A reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type A reactions make up 85 to 90 percent of all adverse drug reactions. These can affect any individual, given sufficient dose and exposure, and are predictable from the known pharmacologic properties of a drug. Examples of type A reactions include diarrhea in response to antibiotics, gastritis in association with long-term use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109975726\"><span class=\"h2\">Type B reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type B reactions make up 10 to 15 percent of adverse drug reactions. These are hypersensitivity reactions, mediated by immunologic or other types of mechanisms, which occur in a susceptible subgroup of patients, have signs and symptoms that are different from the pharmacologic actions of the drug, and usually cannot be predicted.</p><p>Most type B reactions are unpredictable, although notable exceptions are the <strong>predictable</strong> hypersensitivity reactions with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>, and flucloxacillin in patients with certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types. HLA testing of patients is recommended before administering abacavir and carbamazepine in populations in which there is appreciable prevalence of the genotype. Specific screening recommendations are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiseizure-drugs-mechanism-of-action-pharmacology-and-adverse-effects#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiseizure drugs: Mechanism of action, pharmacology, and adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Carbamazepine'</a>.)</p><p>Type B (hypersensitivity) reactions may be further subdivided as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Exaggerated sensitivity to known drug <span class=\"nowrap\">toxicities/intolerance</strong></span> &ndash; Some patients experience the pharmacologically predictable toxicity of a drug (or several drugs) at low and sometimes subtherapeutic doses. An example would be the individual who develops tinnitus in response to a single dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>. This putatively reflects altered drug metabolism or increased end-organ sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Idiosyncratic drug reactions</strong> &ndash; Idiosyncratic drug reactions are qualitatively distinct from the known pharmacologic toxicities of the drug. These reactions can arise from genetic differences in the patient, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primaquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">primaquine</a> causing nonimmune hemolytic anemia in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> toxicity developing in patients with thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemolytic-anemia-due-to-drugs-and-toxins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemolytic anemia due to drugs and toxins&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Aside from a few well-described examples, the mechanisms of most idiosyncratic drug reactions remain obscure and probably reflect complex interactions of metabolic and constitutional factors. Pseudoallergic reactions to NSAIDs are an example. (See <a href=\"#H39\" class=\"local\">'Pseudoallergic reactions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immunologic drug reactions (drug allergy)</strong> &ndash; Drug allergies result from specific immunologic responses to medications. Allergic drug reactions account for about 6 to 10 percent of all adverse drug reactions, but up to 10 percent of fatal reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Allergic drug reactions are the focus of the remainder of this review.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION OF DRUG ALLERGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A drug allergy, or an allergic drug reaction, is a type B adverse drug reaction that results from a specific immunologic response to a medication. The term &quot;immunologic drug reaction&quot; is also used to describe these reactions. Immunologic drug reactions can be mediated by IgE, IgG, or by lymphocytes. There are different systems of classifying immunologic drug reactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22248197\"><span class=\"h2\">Based upon immunologic mechanism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, immunologic reactions, whether caused by drugs, infections, or autoimmune processes, have been divided into four categories (I to IV) according to the Gell and Coombs system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80466\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80466 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I &ndash; Immediate in onset and mediated by IgE and mast cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> basophils.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II &ndash; Delayed in onset and caused by antibody (usually IgG) mediated cell destruction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type III &ndash; Delayed in onset and caused by IgG:drug immune complex deposition and complement activation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type IV &ndash; Delayed in onset and T-cell mediated. Of note, this classification was established before a detailed analysis of T cell subsets and functions was technically possible. As new immunologic tools were developed, type IV reactions were further subdivided into types IVa, IVb, IVc, and IVd (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F75626\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75626 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2650914\" class=\"local\">'Subcategories of type IV'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Medications cause types I and IV reactions far more commonly than types II and III, which usually follow prolonged, higher dose therapy. Most medications cause just one type, although certain drugs, such as penicillin, can induce all four types.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Based upon timing of symptom onset</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The World Allergy Organization (WAO) has recommended dividing immunologic drug reactions into immediate reactions (ie, onset within one hour of exposure) and delayed reactions (onset after one hour), based upon the timing of the appearance of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Immediate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The WAO distinction between immediate and delayed drug reactions is intended to distinguish IgE-mediated, type I reactions from other types. Type I reactions classically begin within one hour of the first administered dose. However, some IgE-mediated reactions appear after one hour, particularly after oral administration of a drug. In addition, taking the medication with food further slows absorption. Nevertheless, this period of one hour identifies the majority of IgE-mediated reactions, which carry the risk of anaphylaxis if the patient is reexposed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Delayed</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reactions appearing after one hour are classified as delayed, although most delayed reactions begin after six hours and typically after days of treatment. As an example, delayed reactions to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> classically start on day 7 to 10 of treatment, and may even begin one to three days after cessation of treatment. These reactions may be caused by several different mechanisms, but they are not IgE-mediated. Types II, III, and IV immunologic reactions are all considered delayed reactions.</p><p>Some delayed reactions begin after weeks of continuous treatment. One such disorder is &quot;drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms&quot; (DRESS), which is a systemic drug reaction that begins 1 to 12 weeks into continuous treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This reaction, which is also called &quot;drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome&quot; (DiHS), is characterized by fever, rash, and multiorgan involvement, and may or may not be associated with eosinophilia and lymphocytosis. The liver (hepatitis) and heart (hypersensitivity myocarditis) may be affected. These reactions can persist for weeks to months, even after the medication is stopped. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Type IV Reactions'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of myocarditis&quot;, section on 'Hypersensitivity myocarditis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPE I REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type I reactions require the presence of drug-specific IgE. A small minority of patients form drug-specific IgE upon exposure to a medication, while most do not even with prolonged treatment.</p><p>Once formed, drug-specific IgE occupies surface receptors on mast cells and basophils throughout the body. If the drug is encountered again, it (or its metabolite) may bind to these IgE molecules, causing crosslinking of the receptors and activation of the cells, resulting in symptoms. IgE-mediated reactions are dose dependent, although this may not be clinically apparent because even very low doses can cause severe systemic symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The signs and symptoms of type I reactions are directly attributable to the vasoactive mediators released by mast cells and basophils. The most common signs and symptoms are urticarial rash (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F75230\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75230 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72519\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72519 \">picture 2</a>); pruritus; flushing; angioedema of the face, extremities, or laryngeal tissues (leading to throat tightness with stridor, or rarely asphyxiation); wheezing; gastrointestinal symptoms; <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypotension.</p><p>Anaphylaxis is the most severe presentation of an IgE-mediated drug reaction. Mast cell tryptase and histamine can be elevated in the circulation in the first several hours after anaphylaxis, and the detection of these mediators implicates mast cells and basophils in the reaction, supporting the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory tests to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presence of urticaria is useful in identifying IgE-mediated reactions, because the classical wheal and flare are hallmark signs of mast cell degranulation. However, other skin findings in drug reactions can mimic urticaria and it can be difficult to discern if a rash was truly urticarial based upon history alone. Many delayed reactions involve a pruritic exanthem or rash that causes diffuse swelling of the skin, and affected patients will report raised, itchy areas of skin. However, these delayed-onset edematous exanthems are NOT urticarial rashes. In addition, they are generally not dangerous, provided the skin does not blister or slough and there are no signs of organ inflammation. Reactions involving rash and organ inflammation are discussed below. Conversely, urticarial rashes may be altered in appearance or suppressed by ongoing antihistamine therapies, such that in such patients the absence of urticaria should not be taken as evidence against anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Type IV Reactions'</a> below.)</p><p>Neither fever nor elevations in serum C-reactive protein are seen with IgE-mediated reactions. The absence of these features can help distinguish IgE-mediated reactions from some other adverse drug reactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The timing of onset of type I reactions is rapid, but varies with the clinical setting and presentation. IgE-mediated reactions occur rapidly after the last administered dose, which underlies the designation of immediate by the World Allergy Organization (WAO). The time to onset is influenced by the route of administration; intravenously administered medications may cause symptoms in seconds to minutes, while the same drug administered orally may cause symptoms in 3 to 30 minutes if taken on an empty stomach, and in 10 to 60 minutes if taken with food.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgE-mediated anaphylactic reactions should NOT begin several days into a course of therapy, if the patient's exposure to the drug has been continuous. However, if several doses are skipped, symptoms can appear when the drug is resumed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urticaria appearing within minutes to hours after drug intake can also be seen in &quot;pseudoallergic&quot; reactions. (See <a href=\"#H39\" class=\"local\">'Pseudoallergic reactions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated urticarial skin eruptions can occur late during continuous therapy:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The delayed appearance of urticarial rashes with known allergenic drugs like beta-lactam antibiotics may reflect time required for significant IgE responses, (similar to late-occurring serum sickness reactions).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Urticaria appearing one to two weeks after therapy, and accompanied by arthralgias and fever suggests serum sickness. (See <a href=\"#H39\" class=\"local\">'Pseudoallergic reactions'</a> below and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Serum sickness'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Urticarial eruptions, often appearing days after start of therapy, sometimes also have maculopapular features. These urticarial rashes typically occur with drugs that rarely cause acute allergy (eg, macrolide antibiotics), and are unlikely to be IgE-mediated. T cells may also be involved, although the pathogenesis is not known.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Commonly-implicated drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The drugs most commonly implicated in type I reactions include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta-lactam drugs (penicillins and cephalosporins).

Only some of these reactions are IgE-mediated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypersensitivity reactions to fluoroquinolones&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platinum containing chemotherapeutic agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a>.

The frequency with which these agents cause anaphylaxis can also vary by geographical location (eg, cetuximab-induced anaphylaxis was initially reported mostly in the southern United States). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infusion-related-reactions-to-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies-used-for-cancer-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infusion-related reactions to therapeutic monoclonal antibodies used for cancer therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Previous exposure to the suspect drug</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IgE-mediated reactions generally require previous exposure to the drug in question. However, the absence of a known prior exposure does not exclude an IgE-mediated reaction, because sensitization may have occurred from exposure to a cross-reactive compound, even though the patient showed no signs of allergy to the sensitizing product.</p><p>The following examples illustrate this phenomenon:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A significant percentage of patients experiencing anaphylaxis upon first exposure to neuromuscular blocking agents are believed to have been previously sensitized through the use of various cosmetics, personal products, and nonprescription cough remedies (eg, pholcodine in Norway) that contain tertiary and quaternary ammonium groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. The ammonium groups shared by all of these agents are highly immunoreactive and can induce cross-reactive IgE antibodies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-etiology-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative anaphylaxis: Clinical manifestations, etiology, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients develop anaphylaxis to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a> and appear to have been previously sensitized to oligosaccharides present on the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The same oligosaccharides are found on several nonprimate mammalian proteins, such as beef, pork, and lamb. The source of the original sensitization is still uncertain, although bites of certain tick species have been implicated.

Type II reactions may arise when drugs bind to surfaces of certain cell types and act as antigens. Subsequent binding of antibodies to the cell surface results in the cells being targeted for clearance by macrophages. Type II reactions may involve complement activation, but this is variable.</p><p>Clinical manifestations require the presence of high titers of preformed drug-specific IgG (or rarely IgM) antibodies, which are only made by a small percentage of individuals and usually in the setting of high-dose, long-term, or recurrent drug exposure. The factors predisposing individuals to form these antibodies are not fully understood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features and timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type II drug reactions usually present as hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia, since these are the cell types that are most often affected.</p><p>The clinical presentation can vary widely in severity; patients may be asymptomatic or present with fulminant illness. Symptoms usually appear at least five to eight days after exposure, but may begin after much longer periods of treatment. Symptoms can start within hours if the causative drug is stopped and then restarted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19047356\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific presentations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific manifestations depend upon the cell type involved:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Drug-induced hemolytic anemia</strong> &ndash; Hemolytic anemia may present with dyspnea, varying degrees of fatigue, pallor, jaundice, dark urine, splenomegaly, or signs and symptoms of the hyperdynamic state, such as bounding pulses, palpitations, and &quot;roaring in the ears.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The drugs most commonly implicated in hemolytic anemia are cephalosporins, penicillins, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and quinine-quinidine.

These reactions are uncommon and usually seen in the context of high-dose, prolonged drug administration, similar to type II reactions.</p><p>In a type III reaction, the drug (including biologicals) is believed to act as a soluble antigen.

Arthus reactions were initially described in hyperimmunized laboratory animals. Whether significant local reactions to booster doses of modern vaccines are true Arthus reactions has not been demonstrated conclusively. Typically, such reactions present as painful local swelling and erythema beginning within a few hours and usually peaking by 24 hours at sites of booster injections of a vaccine. This type of reaction has been reported with tetanus, diphtheria, and hepatitis B vaccines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPE IV REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type IV reactions are not mediated by antibodies, in contrast to the other three types above. Type IV drug reactions involve the activation and expansion of T cells, which requires time (normally many hours or days after antigen exposure), hence the name delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). In some cases, other cell types (eg, macrophages, eosinophils, or neutrophils) are also involved. Type IV reactions can take many different forms, which vary in significance from inconvenient to life threatening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24384193\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of type IV reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type IV reactions are typically delayed in onset by at least 48 to 72 hours and sometimes by days to weeks following exposure to the culprit drug. Upon rechallenge, symptoms may appear within 24 hours. The time to symptom onset for reactions depends in part upon the number of T cells activated by the drug. These responses are polyclonal, and symptoms appear rapidly if the drug stimulates a large number of different T cell clones. In contrast, a drug that activates just a few clones may not cause clinical symptoms until these T cells have proliferated for several weeks.</p><p>Stevens-Johnson <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/toxic</span> epidermal necrolysis <span class=\"nowrap\">(SJS/TEN)</span> and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic <span class=\"nowrap\">symptoms/drug-induced</span> hypersensitivity syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(DRESS/DiHS),</span> the most dangerous of the delayed drug hypersensitivity reactions, often appear after weeks of uncomplicated treatment, at which point patients suddenly develop signs and symptoms of a fulminant immune reaction.

Thus, for drugs such as allopurinol or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a>, lower initial doses may lower the incidence of hypersensitivity.

They are a subset of type B, idiosyncratic reactions and are also called &quot;nonimmune hypersensitivity reactions&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Categories of adverse drug reactions'</a> above.)</p><p>Pseudoallergic reactions are difficult to distinguish clinically because they are similar or identical in presentation to true allergic reactions. Some pseudoallergic reactions arise from direct (rather than immunologic) activation of immune and inflammatory cells, so the final steps in pathogenesis and the resultant clinical features are indistinguishable from those of allergic reactions. The complete mechanisms underlying most of them are not known and may differ from one another (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79967\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79967 \">table 3</a>). However, the diagnosis, prognosis, and prevention may be different from true allergic reactions. In particular, pseudoallergic reactions are not diagnosed with skin or in vitro allergy testing and do not worsen with repeated exposure.

Like IgE-mediated reactions, nonimmunologic activation of mast cells and basophils results in the release of vasoactive mediators. These pseudoallergic reactions range in severity from mild to fatal. Accordingly, acute nonimmunologic anaphylaxis should be treated in the same manner as immunologic anaphylaxis.</p><p>Nonimmunologic reactions resembling anaphylaxis are often referred to as &quot;anaphylactoid.&quot; Unfortunately, the term anaphylactoid has been widely misinterpreted to mean a reaction that was similar to anaphylaxis but less severe, and has led to the undertreatment of patients with nonimmunologic anaphylaxis. Therefore, the term anaphylactoid is now discouraged, and the concept of nonimmunologic anaphylaxis is preferred. Clinicians should understand that all forms of anaphylaxis are potentially life threatening. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is unclear how certain drugs elicit these reactions.
