Because sodium and its anions make up most of the effective osmoles in the extracellular fluid, a high plasma sodium concentration (hypernatremia) indicates hypertonicity and a decrease in cell volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In most cases, hypernatremia results from water depletion. This develops when water losses are not replaced because water is unavailable, when the urge to drink is impaired, or because patients cannot seek water for themselves. Abnormally large unreplaced water losses (as an example, due to diabetes insipidus) result in a rapid onset of hypernatremia. However, even with large water losses, hypernatremia will not develop if thirst is intact and water is available. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'The importance of thirst'</a> below.)</p><p>Although hypernatremia is most often due to water loss, it can also be caused by the intake of salt without water or the administration of hypertonic sodium solutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Sodium overload'</a> below.)</p><p>Hypernatremia due to water depletion is called <strong>dehydration</strong>.<strong> </strong>This is different from <strong>hypovolemia</strong>,<strong> </strong>in which both salt and water are lost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The causes and evaluation of hypernatremia will be reviewed in this topic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F69879\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69879 \">table 1</a>). The treatment of patients with hypernatremia is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypernatremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypernatremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prior to discussing the etiology and evaluation of hypernatremia, it is helpful to review the determinants of the plasma sodium concentration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H190652569\"><span class=\"h1\">DETERMINANTS OF THE PLASMA SODIUM CONCENTRATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To appreciate why hypernatremia develops and how it responds to treatment, the factors that determine the plasma sodium concentration must be understood.</p><p>Solute concentrations (or osmolalities) in the extracellular and intracellular fluids must be equal because water moves freely across most cell membranes. Owing to Na-K-ATPase, which pumps sodium out of cells in exchange for potassium, sodium is largely extracellular, and potassium is intracellular. However, because osmotic gradients are quickly abolished by water movement, body fluids can be conceptualized as a single &quot;tub&quot; containing sodium, potassium, and water. Thus, one would expect the concentration of sodium in plasma water to equal the concentration of sodium plus potassium in total body water (TBW) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This theoretical relationship was proven to be true by experiments that used isotopes to measure body contents of sodium, potassium, and water in patients with a wide range of plasma sodium concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F71817\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71817 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Approximately 30 percent of total body sodium is bound to large polyanionic molecules called proteoglycans, which make up the ground substance of bone, cartilage, and connective tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The amount of bound sodium can vary, and long-term balance studies demonstrate that excess sodium can accumulate in body tissues without altering the serum sodium concentration and without expanding extracellular fluid volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. For clinical purposes, bound sodium can be ignored, although this introduces an error in formulas that predict the serum sodium. However, this error is overshadowed by errors that result from other sources: inaccuracies in estimating TBW from total body weight, problems accounting for the intake and loss of electrolytes and water, and rapid changes in urinary losses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Considering just the portions of body sodium and potassium that are unbound and free in solution, the relationship between the plasma sodium concentration and body electrolyte and water contents is described by the following simple equation, where Na is sodium and K is potassium:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total body (Na + K)<br/> &#160;Plasma Na concentration &#160;= &#160;------------------------<br/> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;TBW</p></div></div><p>The plasma sodium concentration is altered by net sodium and potassium balance (which affects the numerator of the equation) and water balance (which affects the denominator of the equation). To understand changes that occur in the plasma sodium concentration, one must consider the overall tonicity of fluids that are taken in as well as the overall tonicity of fluids that are lost from the body. Just like the plasma sodium concentration, which is determined by the concentrations of sodium and potassium in body water, the tonicity of other fluids, including intravenous fluids, urine, gastrointestinal fluids, and sweat, are also determined by their concentrations of sodium plus potassium.</p><p>The effects of an intravenous fluid or loss of bodily fluids on the plasma sodium concentration depend upon the tonicity of the fluid (determined by the sodium and potassium concentration) and <strong>not</strong> the osmolality of the fluid. As an example, 5 percent dextrose in water (D5W) has an osmolality close to that of normal plasma; the osmolality of D5W allows it to be infused without causing hemolysis, but D5W will lower the plasma sodium concentration because it contains no electrolytes. Similarly, the effect of urinary losses on the plasma sodium concentration depends upon the urine sodium and potassium concentrations and not urine osmolality (which depends in part upon other electrolytes, urea, and glucose). Large volume losses of isosmolar or hyperosmolar urine, for example, may raise the plasma sodium if the urine is relatively electrolyte free.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H190652576\"><span class=\"h2\">Application to hypernatremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypernatremia is most often due to unreplaced water loss, but can also be induced by the administration of hypertonic saline or the ingestion sodium chloride. The intake of potassium without water will have the same effect on the serum sodium as the intake of sodium without water. As an example, the administration of potassium to treat hypokalemia will raise the serum potassium concentration. However, most of the administered potassium will enter the cells, which will cause the osmotic movement of water from the extracellular fluid into the cells, resulting in a small increase in serum sodium unless there is concurrent water intake.</p><p>The importance of the sodium plus potassium in lost body fluids as a determinant of the serum sodium concentration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F71817\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71817 \">figure 1</a>) can be illustrated by considering the composition of various gastrointestinal fluids:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with secretory diarrheas (cholera, VIPoma) have a sodium plus potassium concentration in the diarrheal fluid that is similar to the plasma sodium concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Loss of this fluid will lead to both a fall in extracellular fluid volume and potassium depletion, but will not directly affect the serum sodium concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By contrast, many viral and bacterial enteritides and the osmotic diarrhea induced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactulose</a> (to treat hepatic encephalopathy) or charcoal-sorbitol (to treat a drug overdose) are associated with an isosmotic diarrheal fluid that has a sodium plus potassium concentration between 40 and 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/8,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,11</a>]; organic solutes, which do not affect the serum sodium concentration, make up the remaining osmoles. Unreplaced loss of this fluid will tend to induce hypernatremia because water is being lost in excess of sodium plus potassium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]. Similar considerations apply to urinary losses during an osmotic diuresis induced by glucose, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>, or urea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>] (see below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sodium plus potassium concentration in vomitus and sweat is similar to that in nonsecretory forms of diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. In one study, for example, the sodium plus potassium concentration in gastric fluid was well below that of the plasma, averaging approximately 50 to 55 mEq [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thus, loss of this fluid will tend to raise the serum sodium even though the fluid is isosmotic to plasma. Hydrochloric acid accounts for most of the gap between the osmolality of gastric fluid and the contributions of sodium and potassium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The loss of hydrochloric acid has no effect on the serum sodium.</p><p/><p>Thus, when considering either the etiology or treatment of hypernatremia, it is the <strong>sodium plus potassium</strong> concentration in the fluid lost or the fluid given, <strong>not the osmolality</strong>, that determines the effect on the serum sodium. In patients who are both hypernatremic and hypokalemic, the addition of potassium to the administered fluid will diminish the amount of electrolyte-free water that is given, thereby limiting the reduction in serum sodium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypernatremia#H21881413\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypernatremia&quot;, section on 'If concurrent electrolyte replacement is necessary'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">THE IMPORTANCE OF THIRST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypernatremia can be produced by either the administration of hypertonic sodium solutions or, much more commonly, by the loss of electrolyte-free water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-23</a>]. However, salt intake and water loss seldom result in hypernatremia because the ensuing rise in plasma tonicity stimulates both the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and thirst, thereby minimizing further water loss and increasing water intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/18,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,23,24</a>]. The decrease in water loss and increase in water intake then lower the serum sodium concentration back to normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This regulatory system is so efficient that the plasma osmolality is maintained within a range of 1 to 2 percent despite wide variations in sodium and water intake. Even patients with diabetes insipidus maintain a near-normal serum sodium concentration by appropriately increasing water intake to replace large urinary water losses caused by diminished ADH effect.</p><p>As a result, hypernatremia is seen primarily in patients who cannot experience or respond to thirst normally due to impaired mental status (eg, older adult or critically ill patients) and in infants who can experience thirst but require others to provide fluid intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/18-22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22,25</a>]. In a retrospective review of 103 hospitalized adults who had hypernatremia on admission or developed it after admission, 86 percent lacked free access to water, 94 percent received less than 1000 mL of electrolyte-free water per day, and many had impaired water conservation due to decreased concentrating ability (primarily due to diuretic therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Older adult patients also appear to have diminished osmotic stimulation of thirst via an unknown mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>Hospitalized patients, whether old or young, can become hypernatremic as a result of an inadequate fluid prescription <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impaired thirst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/20,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,28</a>]. The above retrospective review included 85 adults with hospital-acquired hypernatremia, 94 percent of whom received less than one liter of electrolyte-free fluid per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Many hospitalized older adult patients also develop volume depletion because of sodium and water losses due to diuretics, vomiting, or diarrhea coupled with reduced intake.</p><p>Individuals who are alert and have access to water should not develop hypernatremia. Alert patients who are not thirsty despite a serum sodium concentration of 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> or more have, by definition, a hypothalamic lesion affecting the thirst center. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Hypothalamic lesions affecting thirst or osmoreceptor function'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H141685781\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY OF HYPERNATREMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three mechanisms by which hypernatremia can occur: unreplaced water loss, which is by far the most common cause; water loss into cells; and sodium overload. However, persistent hypernatremia should not occur in patients who are alert, have an intact thirst mechanism, and have access to water.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Unreplaced water losses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The loss of solute-free water will, if unreplaced, lead to an elevation in the serum sodium concentration. As described above, the serum sodium concentration and osmolality are determined by the ratio between total body effective osmoles (primarily sodium and potassium salts) and the total body water (TBW) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F71817\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71817 \">figure 1</a>). Loss of fluid with a <strong>sodium plus potassium concentration less than that in the plasma</strong> will, if the water loss is not replaced, raise the serum sodium concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H190652569\" class=\"local\">'Determinants of the plasma sodium concentration'</a> above and <a href=\"#H190652576\" class=\"local\">'Application to hypernatremia'</a> above.)</p><p>There is a variety of sources of electrolyte-free water loss that can lead to hypernatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These include skin, gastrointestinal, and urinary losses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin losses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Water loss from the skin consists of both insensible (transepidermal by diffusion) and sensible (sweat) losses and is important for thermoregulation. Under normal conditions, the volume of sweat is approximately 500 to 700 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> in adults. However, sweat losses are increased dramatically by fever, exercise, and exposure to high temperatures.</p><p>Sweat is derived from the extracellular fluid, and most of the sodium is then removed by the sweat glands. The normal mean sweat sodium concentration is approximately 38 to 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (range 24 to 65 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L),</span> and the mean sweat potassium concentration is approximately 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. As the rate of sweat production increases, the serum sodium concentration rises since sweat is hypotonic to plasma (ie, lower sodium plus potassium concentration), which will promote free water loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/29,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31,32</a>].</p><p>The obligatory water loss from sweat and transdermal evaporative losses must be replaced to avoid hypernatremia. As an example, exclusively breast-fed neonates with a weight loss of more than 10 percent of birth weight are at risk for hypernatremia if inadequate breast-feeding fails to replace ongoing insensible water losses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p>In contrast to water loss in sweat or from evaporation, water that enters alveolar air and is eliminated by breathing does <strong>not</strong> result in net water loss from the body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Partial pressures of water and CO2 are nearly identical in alveolar air in patients with a normal arterial pCO2, and thus are eliminated in a 1:1 ratio. Because water and CO2 are produced in a 1:1 ratio by metabolism of carbohydrates and fatty acids, the loss of water through respiration is equal to its metabolic production.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastrointestinal losses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both upper and lower gastrointestinal losses can result in hypernatremia when water intake is limited. As mentioned above, loss of gastric secretions (due to vomiting or drainage), and small intestinal secretions, have a sodium plus potassium concentration well below that in the plasma and will therefore promote the development of hypernatremia. Similar considerations apply to osmotic diarrheas but not to secretory diarrheas, which have a sodium plus potassium concentration similar to that in the plasma, the loss of which will not directly affect the serum sodium concentration. (See <a href=\"#H190652576\" class=\"local\">'Application to hypernatremia'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H698806827\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinary losses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Free water loss in the urine can lead to hypernatremia if not replaced.

Most patients with diabetes insipidus have a normal thirst mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. As a result, they typically present with polyuria and polydipsia, and a high-normal serum sodium concentration, which is required to stimulate thirst. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and causes of central diabetes insipidus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and causes of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of polyuria and diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, marked and symptomatic hypernatremia can occur in patients with diabetes insipidus if a central lesion impairs both ADH release and thirst, in infants and young children who cannot independently access free water, in the postoperative period in patients with unrecognized diabetes insipidus, and in older adult patients with diabetes insipidus caused by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>].

The loss of such fluid would be expected to raise the serum sodium concentration. However, the changes in plasma osmolality and serum sodium concentration associated with osmotic diuresis are complex.</p><p>As an example, patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or nonketotic hyperglycemia present with a high serum osmolality due to both hyperglycemia and the osmotic diuresis. However, the serum sodium concentration is variable, reflecting the balance between the hyperglycemia-induced increase in serum tonicity, which promotes water movement out of the cells that will lower the serum sodium, and the glucosuria-induced osmotic diuresis, which will tend to raise the serum sodium.

The initial rise in serum mannitol will lower the serum sodium due to osmotic water movement out of the cells. However, in the absence of impaired renal function, mannitol is rapidly excreted in the urine and the associated osmotic diuresis will raise the serum sodium due both to the removal of mannitol from the plasma, which will allow water to move back into the cells, and to the osmotic diuresis, which will cause water loss in excess of sodium plus potassium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-mannitol-therapy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of mannitol therapy&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p>Unlike hyperglycemia and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> therapy, patients who have an osmotic diuresis due to urea (which most commonly occurs during the resolution of azotemia) can produce hypernatremia but not hyponatremia. Because urea is an ineffective osmole, water does not move out of cells, and therefore the elevated serum urea concentrations do not lower the serum sodium. As urea is excreted in the urine, the loss of water in the urine will raise the serum sodium concentration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypothalamic lesions affecting thirst or osmoreceptor function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypernatremia can occur in the absence of increased water losses if there is primary hypothalamic disease impairing thirst (hypodipsia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. A defect in thirst with or without concomitant diabetes insipidus can be seen in children with either congenital or acquired hypothalamic structural lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/24,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,41</a>].

Once called essential hypernatremia, this disorder is now called adipsic diabetes insipidus or central diabetes insipidus with deficient thirst. Causes of adipsic diabetes insipidus include a variety of congenital and acquired central nervous system lesions, with the most common being septo-optic dysplasia, germinoma, rupture or clipping aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery of the circle of Willis, craniopharyngioma, and central nervous system sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/37,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,44,45</a>].</p><p>Adipsic diabetes insipidus was once thought to result from an upward resetting of the osmostat, such that a higher osmolality was recognized as normal. This hypothesis was based upon the observation that giving these patients water reduced ADH release. However, subsequent studies showed that the water-induced suppression of ADH was due to mild volume expansion rather than a fall in serum osmolality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/23,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,46,47</a>]. True upward resetting of the osmostat has been described only in patients with primary mineralocorticoid excess (such as primary aldosteronism).

The body weight at which the serum sodium concentration is normal is determined periodically and the daily water prescription required to maintain a constant body weight and a serum sodium concentration within the target range is determined by trial and error. Deviations from the established ideal weight are then used to modify the water prescription for that day, decreasing or increasing water intake by 500 mL for every 0.5 kg deviation in body weight. A deviation of more than 3 percent of body weight in either direction is an indication to check the serum sodium concentration.</p><p>Daily measurements of the serum sodium may be necessary, particularly in young children and adults with cognitive impairment who cannot regulate their own water intake to achieve the goal body weight.

On the other hand, unreplaced water losses severe enough to produce hypernatremia are associated with weight loss. However, there are two potential limitations to the use of changes in body weight. First, this distinction requires accurate knowledge of the child's baseline weight, which may not be available. Second, weight gain with salt poisoning requires access to water. If the child does not drink, there may actually be a reduction in body weight due to the osmotic diuresis induced by excretion of the excess sodium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sodium excretion is appropriately increased with salt poisoning and is appropriately reduced with hypovolemia due to unreplaced water losses. The urine sodium concentration may be misleading since a highly concentrated urine due to hypernatremia-induced stimulation of ADH release can raise an appropriately low urine sodium concentration to a value that might be consistent with euvolemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) may be more accurate than the urine sodium concentration since it is not affected by the urine volume. It has been suggested that, in infants and young children with hypernatremia and normal renal function, a FENa greater than 2 percent is strongly suggestive of salt poisoning and values between 1 and 2 percent are consistent with the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">By contrast, in patients with relatively normal renal function, a FENa less than 0.1 to 0.2 percent is suggestive of hypernatremia caused by water loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. A similar finding would be expected with a late presentation of salt poisoning, after the administered salt has been excreted and hypovolemia has been induced by the osmotic diuresis, or if the patient has concomitant salt poisoning and hypovolemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One problem with the use of the FENa is that the values that define volume depletion vary with the filtered sodium load, which is determined by the glomerular filtration rate. The FENa that defines hypovolemia progressively rises toward 1 percent in patients with increasingly impaired renal function. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Thus, the initial therapy is directed at rapid reduction in the serum sodium concentration to reduce the neurologic risk of prolonged severe hypernatremia.

A plasma osmolality above 295 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> (which represents a serum sodium concentration above 145 to 147 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> generally leads to sufficient ADH secretion to maximally stimulate urinary concentration.

In such patients, the presence of an osmotic diuresis can be confirmed by measuring total solute excretion (equal to the product of the urine osmolality and the daily urine volume). The normal value on a regular diet is 600 to 900 mosmol per day (consisting primarily of sodium, potassium, ammonium salts, and urea). A value well above 1000 mosmol per day suggests at least a contribution from increased solute excretion. Patients with an osmotic diuresis and hypernatremia will not respond to exogenous ADH, since the endogenous effect is already maximal. If an osmotic diuresis is not present, an evaluation to rule out diabetes insipidus should be performed.

Repeat measurements of urine and plasma osmolality should be obtained as the patient is treated with hypotonic fluids. If the urine becomes dilute while the plasma osmolality is still higher than normal, then the diagnosis is partial diabetes insipidus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

Calculation of the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), using either standard units (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-fractional-excretion-of-sodium\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) or SI units (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-fractional-excretion-of-sodium-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>), may be helpful since it eliminates the effect of urine volume. However, the FENa value used to define hypovolemia is much lower than the 1 percent cutoff used in acute kidney injury.

Common examples of hypotonic losses include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Upper gastrointestinal fluid (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal losses'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diarrhea caused by osmotic cathartics like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactulose</a> or infections (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal losses'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Urinary losses due to diabetes insipidus, glycosuria, urea, and osmotic or loop diuretics (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Osmotic diuresis'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypernatremia can occur in the absence of increased water losses if there is primary hypothalamic disease impairing thirst (hypodipsia), sometimes associated with concurrent diabetes insipidus (adipsic diabetes insipidus). In such patients, forced water intake is usually sufficient to maintain a normal serum sodium concentration, although in patients with adipsic diabetes insipidus, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> must also be given. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Hypothalamic lesions affecting thirst or osmoreceptor function'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12664565\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of adipsic diabetes insipidus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient hypernatremia can develop after seizures or intense exercise. The ensuing increase in intracellular osmolality via break down of glycogen into smaller more osmotically active molecules leads to internal shift of water into cells. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Water loss into cells'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute and often marked hypernatremia can be induced by massive salt ingestion or administration of hypertonic sodium-containing solutions. In such patients, initial therapy is directed at rapid reduction in the serum sodium concentration to reduce the neurologic risk of prolonged severe hypernatremia. (See <a href=\"#H254062278\" class=\"local\">'Salt poisoning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The administration of isotonic saline to match hypotonic fluid losses causes hypernatremia by net salt gain, equivalent to the effect of administering hypertonic saline. This scenario commonly occurs during the treatment of uncontrolled diabetes, recovering azotemia, nasogastric suction, and critically ill patients who have received large amounts of saline and subsequently treated for edema using loop diuretics. (See <a href=\"#H254062285\" class=\"local\">'Iatrogenic sodium loading'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cause of the hypernatremia is usually evident from the history. In adults, it is most often due to water losses in older patients that are not replaced because of impaired mental status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F69879\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69879 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6017462\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of hypernatremia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the etiology of hypernatremia is unclear, the diagnosis can usually be established by measurement of the urine osmolality and, if the urine osmolality is less than 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg,</span> observing the change in urine osmolality after administration of exogenous ADH.
