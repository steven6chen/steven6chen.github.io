This may manifest as a tubo-ovarian complex (an agglutination of those structures) or a collection of pus (tubo-ovarian abscess). These abscesses are found most commonly in reproductive age women and typically result from upper genital tract infection. Tubo-ovarian abscess is usually a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease. </p><p>Tubo-ovarian abscess is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. Aggressive medical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgical therapy is required and rupture of an abscess may result in sepsis. The mortality rate associated with tubo-ovarian abscess was approximately 50 percent or higher prior to the advent of broad-spectrum antibiotics and modern surgical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>In current practice, the mortality rate approaches zero for abscesses that have not ruptured. Current mortality rates for patients with ruptured abscesses are not reported in the literature; data from the 1960s suggested a mortality rate ranging from 1.7 to 3.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>].</p><p>Treatment modalities include broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, minimally-invasive drainage procedures, invasive surgery, or combinations of these interventions. For the large majority of small to medium sized tubo-ovarian abscesses, antibiotic therapy alone can affect cure. </p><p>The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of tubo-ovarian abscesses are reviewed here. Other manifestations of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Pathogenesis, microbiology, and risk factors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term complications of pelvic inflammatory disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25899120\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few data regarding the incidence of tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA). In the United States from 1983 to 2000, 200,000 women were hospitalized annually for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is important to note that not all cases of TOA are associated with PID. Nevertheless, since approximately one-third of women who are hospitalized with a diagnosis of PID are found to have a TOA, it can be extrapolated that approximately 66,000 cases of tubo-ovarian abscesses occur annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. A study from Norway reported that the number of patients admitted with a diagnosis of PID decreased between the time periods of 1990 to 1992 and 2000 to 2002, but a higher proportion of those patients had TOAs (increased from 26 to 43 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The cause of this increase is not clear, but it may be related to changing practice patterns in the treatment of PID. In current practice, most women with PID receive outpatient treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Women who are admitted to the hospital have severe disease, and this includes those with TOA. </p><p>Women with a TOA are most likely to be between the ages of 15 and 40 years, but age should not exclude the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess#H4862349\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and complications of tubo-ovarian abscess&quot;, section on 'Postmenopausal women'</a>.)</p><p>The risk factors for TOA are the same as for PID, and include the following: multiple sexual partners, age between 15 to 25 years, and a prior history of PID. Several cases of TOA following oocyte retrieval for in vitro fertilization have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Pathogenesis, microbiology, and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Modern intrauterine devices (IUD) cause little, if any, increased risk for PID. The use of an IUD may be a risk factor for the development of a TOA (specifically unilateral TOA), but this association has not been substantiated by well-designed studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. IUDs that have been available since the late 1990s appear to be responsible for little, if any, increase in the risk for developing PID. The slight elevated risk of developing PID among users of modern IUDs appears to be primarily limited to the first three weeks after IUD insertion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Pathogenesis, microbiology, and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Intrauterine device and tubal ligation'</a>.)</p><p>Some data suggest that women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are more likely to develop a TOA than other women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25899127\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2672684\"><span class=\"h2\">Progression of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of the formation of a tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) has not been fully elucidated. TOAs most frequently result from upper genital tract infection, usually pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67365\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67365 \">figure 1</a>). A TOA may also arise from local spread of infection associated with uncontrolled inflammatory diseases of the bowel, appendicitis, adnexal surgery or, occasionally, from hematologic spread. Pelvic abscesses that do not involve the tubo-ovarian complex often differ in etiology and management from TOAs and are not discussed here. Rarely, women who have undergone previous hysterectomy may still be at risk for the formation of a TOA, likely from local <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hematogenous spread from non-gynecologic organ systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>It is unclear why some women with upper genital tract infection develop a TOA, while the majority do not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/8,15,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15,22</a>]. In the majority of cases, the infection appears to originate within the lower genital tract from a sexually transmitted pathogen or from a woman&rsquo;s endogenous flora. Infection then ascends to the fallopian tubes. Ascending inflammation can progress to cause not only damage to the endothelium of the fallopian tube (destroying both the secretory and ciliated cells), but also edema of the infundibulum of the tube. This results in tubal blockage due to clubbing, ischemia, and necrosis, which contributes to the development of pyosalpinx. Prior infection may also result in abnormal tubal architecture that predisposes to TOA.</p><p>Delay in diagnosis because of a failure to recognize or report symptoms by the patient (and thus not seeking care) does not appear to offer a complete explanation for progression to the development of TOA. This is supported by the fact that a sizable percentage of women with TOAs do not report specific antecedent acute symptoms directly attributable to PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>TOAs are either tubo-ovarian complexes (an agglutination of pelvic organs with or without bowel) or a collection of pus that can be approached for drainage. Different treatment approaches are required depending upon these two forms (eg, drainage is typically feasible only for collections). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess#H18590491\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and complications of tubo-ovarian abscess&quot;, section on 'Candidates for antibiotic therapy alone'</a>.)</p><p>Uncontrolled tubal infection with associated tissue invasion and destruction typically produces a copious purulent exudate with gradually increasing tissue edema. This edema in turn may compromise local blood supply and result in tissue necrosis. Tubal structures may adhere to and coalesce with the adjacent ovarian tissue (and often adjacent nongenital tract tissues) to form a complex mass. Necrosis inside this complex mass may result in one or more abscess cavities with an anaerobic environment that allows or even promotes the growth of numerous anaerobic bacteria that were previously present in the endogenous pelvic flora [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/8,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2672691\"><span class=\"h2\">Microbiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TOAs are typically polymicrobial. The bacteria found in TOAs are often similar to those found in patients with uncomplicated PID. There is also some overlap between the organisms commonly isolated in women with bacterial vaginosis and those isolated from patients with TOA; however, no direct link between bacterial vaginosis and TOA has been confirmed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Pathogenesis, microbiology, and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Microbiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial vaginosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis and microbiology'</a>.)</p><p>Mixtures of aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic organisms have been isolated from TOAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Common organisms include Escherichia coli, aerobic streptococci, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella, and other anaerobes, such as Peptostreptococcus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Scattered case reports highlight the potential for an occasional unusual pathogen to be isolated from a TOA, including Candida species, <em>Pasteurella multocida</em>, Salmonellae species, and <em>S. pneumoniae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Rarely, in an immunocompromised patient, <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> may also be causative of a TOA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. &#160;</p><p>TOAs that occur in women with an intrauterine device (IUD), typically long-term users, are often associated with a specific anaerobic pathogen, Actinomyces israelii [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The reason for the relationship between this potential pathogen and IUD users remains controversial. Management of women with an IUD who develop a PID is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess#H4862342\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and complications of tubo-ovarian abscess&quot;, section on 'Intrauterine devices'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Management of side effects and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis are rarely isolated from the abscess cavity of a TOA. The role of these organisms appears to be limited to antecedent infections, such as cervicitis or PID. As an example, in a series of 232 women with a TOA, N. gonorrhoeae was found in the endocervix in approximately 33 percent of cases, but was present in less than 4 percent of the associated TOAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Some data suggest that N. gonorrhoeae facilitates invasion of the upper genital tract by lower genital tract flora, thus indirectly increasing the risk of progressive infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2672637\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2457194\"><span class=\"h2\">Typical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) is typically considered a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and the classic presentation is the same as for PID alone, including acute lower abdominal pain, fever, chills, and vaginal discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/7,8,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>However, the presentation of some women with TOA differs from the classic scenario. Fever is not present in all patients and some patients report only low grade nocturnal fevers or chills. Also, not all women present in an acute fashion. These variations in clinical presentation were illustrated in one of the largest series of women with TOA (n = 175) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As many as 40 percent of patients were afebrile upon presentation; 25 percent complained of chronic rather than acute abdominal pain; and 23 percent had normal white blood cell counts. </p><p>In addition, some women with TOAs may present with seemingly unrelated symptoms, such as diffuse persistent upper abdominal pain or a change in bowel habits. Most women will not be overtly septic-appearing if their TOA is intact.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26295331\"><span class=\"h2\">Ruptured abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with a ruptured TOA classically present with an acute abdomen and signs of sepsis, although this is not invariably noted. Most women will not be overtly septic appearing with intact abscesses. Rupture is probably a misnomer, as the process is more like a leak, slow or fast; it is not typical for the abscess to burst open. A &ldquo;ruptured&rdquo; TOA may sometimes produce a life-threatening illness, requiring immediate surgical exploration. (See <a href=\"#H6513544\" class=\"local\">'Excluding sepsis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2457328\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION OF WOMEN WITH SUSPECTED TOA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of women with suspected tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) includes making the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and then pursuing further testing to evaluate for TOA. In addition, other etiologies of the clinical presentation should be excluded.

Laboratory testing includes a complete blood count and cervical testing for gonococcus and chlamydia. A pregnancy test should be performed, since this may affect choice of antimicrobial therapy and clinical course.</p><p>The diagnosis and evaluation of PID are discussed in detail separately.

Once a woman has been diagnosed with PID, it is a clinical priority to decide whether she requires further evaluation for TOA. </p><p>Further evaluation for TOA involves pelvic imaging. A very low threshold is warranted for performing imaging among all women admitted with PID, given the serious nature of a TOA and the frequent inability to adequately assess for masses on pelvic exam due to pelvic tenderness. We routinely order imaging studies for women with a diagnosis of PID who have one or more of the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acutely ill.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant abdominopelvic tenderness precluding a complete pelvic examination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adnexal mass noted on examination, particularly a tender mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/7,8,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of, or poor response to, antibiotic therapy.

Of all women admitted with a diagnosis of PID, multiple studies have suggested that women older than age 40 and those with higher laboratory markers of inflammation (white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> C-reactive protein) are more likely to have a TOA versus PID alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6972017\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most useful and commonly performed studies in the evaluation for a TOA are pelvic ultrasonography or pelvic computed tomography (CT).</p><p>Ultrasound is typically the first line imaging study since it produces high quality images of the upper genital tract, is less expensive than CT and does not expose the patient to radiation. Ultrasound is also preferred when other genital tract pathology must be excluded (eg, ovarian cyst, ectopic pregnancy, degenerating uterine fibroid).</p><p>Ultrasonographic images of TOAs typically demonstrate complex multilocular masses that often obliterate the normal adnexal architecture <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cul-de-sac anatomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77543\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77543 \">image 1</a>). These masses also often appear to contain speckled fluid and internal echoes consistent with inflammatory debris [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/7,8,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,31</a>]. This would be compared to a typical non-inflammatory mass with clear fluid and a thin rim. Choice of imaging modality is often institution-specific, with radiological potential for imaging-guided drainage procedures and local expertise being relevant considerations.</p><p>CT is preferred in women in whom pathology associated with the gastrointestinal tract must be excluded (eg, appendicitis, phlegmon or abscess associated with inflammatory bowel disease). A few studies suggest use of CT may pose a slight advantage in terms of increased sensitivity to detect a TOA when compared to ultrasound (78 to 100 percent versus 75 to 82 percent, respectively). However, CT imaging is more costly than ultrasonography. In addition, the higher sensitivity of CT scan also assumes the patient had both intravenous and oral contrast, which may not be possible in ill patients for various reasons (eg, inability to tolerate oral intake of contrast) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/22,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,31,32</a>]. </p><p>Specific findings noted on CT that are consistent with a TOA include thick-walled, rim-enhancing adnexal masses. Again, this is in contrast to non-inflammatory masses with thin walls that are not rim-enhancing. Inflammatory masses are also often multilocular and may have an increased fluid density suggestive of purulent exudate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. CT imaging in some patients with TOA may show evidence of thickened fluid-filled tubes consistent with pyosalpinx, adjacent regional bowel thickening, and mesenteric stranding. </p><p>In addition, CT (and occasionally ultrasound) may show changes suggestive of abscess rupture, with free abdominopelvic thickened fluid (often pus) and the presence of an abscess wall in the pelvis.</p><p>There are few data about the use of other imaging modalities (eg, magnetic resonance imaging, radionuclide scanning) for the diagnosis of TOA.

This may manifest as a tubo-ovarian complex (an agglutination of those structures) or a collection of pus (tubo-ovarian abscess). (See <a href=\"#H25899106\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TOAs are found most commonly in reproductive age women and typically result from upper genital tract infection. (See <a href=\"#H25899127\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TOAs are typically polymicrobial. Mixtures of aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic organisms have been isolated from TOAs using modern culture techniques with attention to specific anaerobic methodology. Common organisms include Escherichia coli, aerobic streptococci, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella, and other anaerobes, such as Peptostreptococcus. (See <a href=\"#H2672691\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic presentation of TOA includes acute lower abdominal pain, fever, chills, and vaginal discharge. However, the presentation of many women with TOA differs from this classic scenario. (See <a href=\"#H2672637\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detecting TOA in women with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a clinical priority. TOAs are most commonly detected based on findings from pelvic imaging. We order imaging studies for women with a diagnosis of PID who have the following characteristics: acutely ill; lack of, or poor response to, antibiotic therapy; adnexal mass noted on examination; or significant abdominopelvic tenderness precluding a complete pelvic examination. (See <a href=\"#H6513071\" class=\"local\">'Further evaluation for TOA'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging studies are a crucial component of the diagnosis of TOA. Ultrasound is typically the first line imaging study. It is also useful for excluding other genital tract pathology (eg, ovarian cyst, ectopic pregnancy, degenerating uterine fibroid). Computed tomography may also be used, particularly when pathology associated with the gastrointestinal tract must be excluded (eg, appendicitis, phlegmon or abscess associated with inflammatory bowel disease). (See <a href=\"#H6972017\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with a ruptured TOA classically present with an acute abdomen and signs of sepsis, although this is not invariably noted. A ruptured abscess may be life-threatening, and requires immediate surgical exploration. (See <a href=\"#H26295331\" class=\"local\">'Ruptured abscess'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Granberg S, Gjelland K, Ekerhovd E.
