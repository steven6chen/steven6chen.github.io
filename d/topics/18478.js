After removal of the uterine specimen, the vaginal incision (vaginal cuff) is typically sutured closed. Vaginal cuff dehiscence refers to separation of the vaginal incision. The term vaginal cuff dehiscence is frequently interchanged with the terms cuff separation or cuff rupture. All denote the separation of a vaginal incision that was previously closed at time of initial hysterectomy.</p><p>After dehiscence of the vaginal cuff, abdominal or pelvic contents are at risk of evisceration (expulsion) through the vaginal opening. Bowel evisceration can lead to serious sequelae, including peritonitis, bowel injury and necrosis, and sepsis. Prompt surgical and medical intervention is required.</p><p>Incidence, risk factors, and management recommendations for vaginal dehiscence that occurs after total hysterectomy will be reviewed here. Other complications of gynecologic surgery are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-gynecologic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of gynecologic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal cuff dehiscence following hysterectomy is a rare event with an estimated incidence of 0.39 percent (0.27 to 0.96 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cuff-dehiscence-after-hysterectomy/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. In the largest single-center study, 28 cases of vaginal cuff dehiscence were reported among 11,606 patients (0.24 percent) who underwent total hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cuff-dehiscence-after-hysterectomy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The largest multi-institution study included 12,398 patients and reported 38 cases (0.31 percent) of dehiscence after hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cuff-dehiscence-after-hysterectomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Both studies included patients undergoing hysterectomy for benign and malignant indications. While one study reported a nearly 1 percent incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence after total hysterectomy, the study sample size was much smaller (n = 2382 women), which may make the findings less reliable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cuff-dehiscence-after-hysterectomy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence after any type of pelvic surgery (as opposed to hysterectomy) is approximately 0.03 percent and varies by surgical approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cuff-dehiscence-after-hysterectomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>The true incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence after hysterectomy is difficult to determine since this complication is likely underreported. Also, patients with cuff dehiscences may present to a different physician or hospital than for the initial hysterectomy, thereby making data collection difficult. Further, case reports of vaginal cuff dehiscence generally do not include for comparison the number of hysterectomies that were NOT associated with this complication. Lastly, the rate of dehiscence appears to vary by type of hysterectomy.</p><p>The rate of vaginal cuff dehiscence is higher after laparoscopic compared with abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy (following laparoscopic = 0.87 percent (range 0.64 to 1.1 percent), abdominal = 0.28 percent [0.15 to 0.6 percent], or vaginal hysterectomy = 0.15 percent [0.08 to 0.32 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cuff-dehiscence-after-hysterectomy/abstract/1-5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5,8</a>]. Some studies suggest vaginal closure of the cuff after laparoscopic hysterectomy results in a lower incidence of dehiscence (0.18 to 0.30 percent) than laparoscopic hysterectomies with laparoscopic closure of the cuff (0.64 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cuff-dehiscence-after-hysterectomy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. While there have been concerns about a markedly high rate of cuff dehiscence following laparoscopic hysterectomy (4.93 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cuff-dehiscence-after-hysterectomy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], a follow-up study suggests a lower dehiscence rate of 0.75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cuff-dehiscence-after-hysterectomy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>In contrast, robot-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy appears to have a higher incidence of dehiscence (2.33 percent, range 0.4-4.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cuff-dehiscence-after-hysterectomy/abstract/4,10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10-13</a>]. However, conclusions are limited because of the small number and size of the studies and limited data directly comparing the various techniques. In one study that did compare the different routes of hysterectomy, the incidence of dehiscence was 3.3 percent for robotic-assisted, 1.1 percent for laparoscopic, 0.6 percent for abdominal, and 0.3 percent for vaginal hysterectomy. Of note, only 184 of the 2382 hysterectomies were robot-assisted, which may impact the study outcomes. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As vaginal dehiscence is rare, it is difficult to identify predisposing factors. Many studies have attempted to evaluate risk factors for dehiscence, but these studies are limited by the infrequency of the outcome and are primarily retrospective. Prior studies have suggested that risk factors for vaginal dehiscence vary among postmenopausal women (eg, pelvic prolapse) compared with premenopausal women (eg, coitus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cuff-dehiscence-after-hysterectomy/abstract/1,7,8,14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,8,14-19</a>]. Although menopausal status itself may be a risk factor for dehiscence, increasing age does not appear to be related [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cuff-dehiscence-after-hysterectomy/abstract/4,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,20</a>]. </p><p>In general, cuff dehiscence is associated with risk factors for infection, poor wound healing, excessive pressure at the vaginal incision site, or pelvic floor defects; however, some instances of vaginal cuff dehiscence occur spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cuff-dehiscence-after-hysterectomy/abstract/1,7,8,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,8,15</a>].

This may potentially increase tissue necrosis and lead to poor healing of the vaginal cuff compared with a sharp colpotomy that is made with a scalpel or scissors.

Most studies are retrospective, underpowered, and lack a comparison group. The highest rates of cuff dehiscence are cited for robotic hysterectomy, followed by laparoscopic, abdominal, and vaginal hysterectomy.

Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for hysterectomy patients also minimizes the risk of vaginal cuff infections.

Regardless of mode of incision, the same general surgical principles should be applied, which include preservation of vaginal length and tissue quality, limited use of energy for cuff hemostasis, avoiding tissue necrosis, and adequate cuff closure. These aspects are reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-hysterectomy#H341555638\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic hysterectomy&quot;, section on 'Vaginal cuff'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, scar tissue attains about 40 percent of its final strength in the first postoperative month and strength continues to increase for as long as a year after injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cuff-dehiscence-after-hysterectomy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Therefore, after total hysterectomy, women should maintain pelvic rest (defer vaginal intercourse and avoid placing objects into the vagina) and refrain from heavy lifting. In our practice, we advise patients to avoid these activities for a minimum of eight weeks. Patients at high risk of dehiscence may be counseled to avoid these activities for an extended period (eg, 12 weeks, and possibly longer), although there are no data to show that a prolonged period of pelvic rest decreases the risk of cuff dehiscence.

However, further study is needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of this use of ET. In the only randomized trial to address this use of ET, 315 postmenopausal women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy for benign indications were randomized to transdermal ET for 14 days before and after surgery or vaginal ET for 14 days before surgery and no postoperative ET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cuff-dehiscence-after-hysterectomy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

The larger the vaginal cuff dehiscence, the greater the risk of evisceration of an organ through the vaginal cuff defect.

The vaginal cuff defect <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> eviscerating structure may be visualized on speculum examination or palpated on bimanual pelvic examination. Pelvic floor defects (eg, apical prolapse) are noted and the vaginal cuff is inspected for hematoma, cellulitis, or abscess. In addition, an abdominal examination is performed to evaluate for peritoneal signs.</p><p>Of note, it is important to differentiate a vaginal cuff dehiscence (separation of the vaginal incision that was previously closed) from a gap on the vaginal cuff. A vaginal cuff gap is an opening on the vaginal incision due to a gap in suture placement, but does not extend into the peritoneum. A gap in the vaginal cuff closure may be managed expectantly unless it is sufficiently large to pose evisceration risks.</p><p>Hemodynamically stable women without bowel evisceration may be candidates for transvaginal repair without abdominal exploration. If there is any clinical concern for a bowel injury, the abdomen and pelvis are imaged (eg, computed tomography). Alternatively, if the vaginal cuff is to be repaired laparoscopically, then the abdomen and pelvis can be directly explored at the time of surgery and preoperative imaging may not be necessary. </p><p>In contrast, women with bowel evisceration are best assessed in the operating room. Since bowel evisceration can lead to peritonitis and sepsis, all women with bowel eviscerations are considered to have a surgical emergency, and surgery should not be delayed for imaging.</p><p>Once the vaginal cuff dehiscence is diagnosed, the clinician should evaluate the patient for risk factors that may have predisposed her to dehiscence, or potential sequelae of dehiscence, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal cuff infection or abscess</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal cuff hematoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bowel obstruction or perforation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal or pelvic mass, malignancy, or foreign body</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal cuff dehiscences can present as complete or partial separation of the vaginal incision with or without bowel evisceration. </p><p>All women have intravenous access established for fluid and medication management. Vaginal cuff dehiscence exposes the peritoneal cavity to contamination from vaginal bacteria and the risk of subsequent peritonitis and sepsis, particularly for women with evisceration. We give all patients with or without evisceration broad-spectrum antibiotics for 24 hours (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>). If an infection or bowel injury is present, the choice of antibiotics and length of treatment is individualized.</p><p>For women with cuff dehiscences without evisceration, expectant or surgical management may be employed depending on the size of the cuff separation. Some clinicians manage small dehiscences (ie, less than 25 percent separation) expectantly. In our practice, we prefer to close all recognized dehiscences because a partial separation may reflect the potential for further separation. As there is no existing standard of care, each patient should be assessed individually. When surgical closure is elected, women with vaginal cuff dehiscence, stable vital signs, and no bowel evisceration can be repaired vaginally without an abdominal survey. In fact, the majority of dehiscences are successfully repaired this way.</p><p>In contrast, women with bowel evisceration have a surgical emergency. Prior to surgery, the visible bowel is inspected for injury. The prolapsed bowel or other structures are then gently reduced. If the evisceration is successfully reduced, the patient is then placed in Trendelenburg position and the vagina is packed to minimize the risk of re-evisceration while preparing the patient for the operating room. A bladder catheter is placed prior to vaginal packing since the packing material may obstruct the bladder outlet. If the bowel is not reducible, the prolapsed structures should be irrigated with warm normal saline and wrapped in a moist towel.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Choosing a surgical approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determining the best mode of surgery for repair of the vaginal cuff dehiscence depends upon the patient's condition and the surgeon's experience.

For stable women with a bowel evisceration that appears healthy and can be fully evaluated vaginally, vaginal reduction of the eviscerated bowel is an option with the caveat that there can be no signs of peritonitis or a bowel injury. We prefer a laparoscopic repair, since it enables us to maintain a minimally invasive approach for cuff closure and allows us to survey the intraperitoneal cavity for potential complications such as bowel injuries, abscess, and hematoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Cuff closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to cuff closure, we copiously irrigate the vaginal dehiscence site. Next we excise any areas of necrotic cuff tissue using cold cutting dissection techniques (eg, with a scalpel or scissors) until healthy viable tissue edges are exposed. It is important to not make the cuff edge overly hemostatic, as excessive thermal coagulation may interfere with healing. Bleeding from the tissue edges is typically a sign of healthy tissue. </p><p>Stable hematomas may be observed; however, hematomas that limit surgical access should be drained. Expanding hematomas are opened to control bleeding and identify the source, if possible. If there is a vaginal cuff abscess, it is drained. For either hematoma or abscess, a drain may be indicated.</p><p>To close the vaginal cuff, we use a delayed absorbable monofilament suture (eg, polydioxanone [PDS II]) rather than catgut. Although some surgeons use a delayed absorbable braided suture, we prefer a monofilament suture for the theoretical advantage of lower infection risk. We recommend placing the suture no more than 1 cm from each other and at least 1 cm from the vaginal cuff edge. The closure should be full thickness, including the vaginal epithelium, vaginal musculature, and the pubocervical fascial ring. The goal is to reapproximate but not strangulate the vaginal cuff tissue. For laparoscopic repair, some data suggest lower risk of cuff dehiscence when barbed suture is used for cuff closure; however, the data are limited and underpowered, and further studies are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cuff-dehiscence-after-hysterectomy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. If a bladder or bowel injury is noted, or adhesions to the cuff are suspected, cystoscopy, laparoscopy, or laparotomy may be needed for diagnosis and treatment. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Surgical technique'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative care and follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We advise patients to delay resumption of vaginal intercourse for three months after vaginal dehiscence repair. As discussed above, estrogen replacement may potentiate vaginal wound healing in postmenopausal women.</p><p>Any underlying conditions that chronically increase abdominal pressures (eg, chronic cough, asthma, reflux, constipation, emesis) should be treated aggressively to minimize recurrent stress on the healing vaginal cuff (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative period'</a> above).</p><p>We monitor women who have undergone vaginal dehiscence repair frequently, with postoperative visits scheduled at 2, 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively. At each visit we perform a vaginal speculum examination to confirm cuff closure and absence of infection or hematoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal cuff dehiscence is the separation of the vaginal incision after total hysterectomy. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal cuff dehiscence is rare. Major risk factors are: total robotic or laparoscopic hysterectomy, vaginal cuff infection, vaginal trauma (eg, coitus), and cigarette smoking. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic or abdominal pain and vaginal <span class=\"nowrap\">discharge/bleeding</span> are the most common clinical symptoms. Evisceration of the bowel or other structures is a less common, but much more serious sequelae of dehiscence, which constitutes a surgical emergency. Bowel evisceration can lead to bowel necrosis and subsequent peritonitis and sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal cuff dehiscence is diagnosed by physical examination. Evisceration and hemodynamic instability should be addressed promptly. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repair of a dehiscence without evisceration can be performed using a vaginal or abdominal approach; however, injury or incarceration of bowel requires abdominal exploration via laparoscopy or laparotomy. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a surgical approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preventive strategies include optimizing vaginal cuff tissue quality and security of closure, minimizing cuff infection, and avoidance of vaginal intercourse or other vaginal insertions for at least four weeks. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For surgical closure of the cuff, we use a delayed absorbable monofilament suture that is placed at least 1 cm from the vaginal edge and incorporates the vaginal epithelium, musculature, and pubocervical ring. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women undergoing robotic or laparoscopic total hysterectomy, in whom the colpotomy is made with a device that uses an energy source (eg, electrosurgery, ultrasonic energy), we suggest use of techniques that minimize tissue necrosis rather than other techniques (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cuff-dehiscence-after-hysterectomy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Iaco PD, Ceccaroni M, Alboni C, et al.
