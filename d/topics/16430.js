This topic will review periprocedural stroke in the setting of cardiac catheterization, which includes diagnostic and interventional procedures. Other aspects of acute stroke are discussed elsewhere.

Catheter or wire manipulation may dislodge debris made up of thrombus, calcific material, or cholesterol particles from atherosclerotic plaques within the aortic arch and the proximal carotid and vertebral arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-after-cardiac-catheterization/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. In addition, fresh thrombus material may form at the catheter and guidewire tips. Most cases of ischemic stroke related to cardiac catheterization are caused by such thromboemboli. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from atherosclerotic plaque: Atheroembolism (cholesterol crystal embolism)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The mechanism of ischemic stroke is similar between diagnostic and interventional procedures. However, interventional catheters are on average larger than diagnostic catheters and the procedures are often longer and thus there may be a theoretical increase in risk. </p><p>Ultimately, one or more catheters end up in one of the cardiac chambers or in the coronaries arteries. Catheterization across a degenerated aortic valve may lead to thromboembolism and the risk of stroke may be particularly high in patients with significant valvular aortic stenosis (AS) who undergo retrograde catheterization of the aortic valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-after-cardiac-catheterization/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. This was demonstrated in a study of 152 patients with AS (mean age 71 years) who were randomly assigned to cardiac catheterization with or without catheter passage through the valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-after-cardiac-catheterization/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The higher estimate (0.6 percent) comes from a meta-analysis of studies that performed systematic neurologic evaluation and brain MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-after-cardiac-catheterization/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Among those undergoing percutaneous coronary (artery) intervention (PCI), the rate ranges from 0.07 to 0.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-after-cardiac-catheterization/abstract/12,14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14-19</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest study retrospectively evaluated over 426,000 patients undergoing PCI between 2007 and 2012 in the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society database.

Stroke was seen in 0.4 percent of the total population having PCI (0.3 percent in those having elective PCI and 0.6 percent in those having PCI performed for acute coronary syndrome). &#160;</p><p/><p>Hemorrhagic stroke, most often intracerebral hemorrhage, has accounted for 8 to 46 percent of stroke related to cardiac catheterization in the few registries that distinguish between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-after-cardiac-catheterization/abstract/9,12,15,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,15,18-20</a>]. Subarachnoid hemorrhage following cardiac catheterization is probably uncommon if not rare, with only a few cases reported in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-after-cardiac-catheterization/abstract/9,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,21</a>]. However, most studies of invasive cardiac procedures reporting the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage do not distinguish intracerebral hemorrhage from subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk of hemorrhagic stroke is probably increased for patients undergoing acute coronary interventions because of the intense antithrombotic regimens that are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-after-cardiac-catheterization/abstract/9,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,22</a>]. </p><p>Compared with procedures on the coronary arteries, the incidence of periprocedural stroke is somewhat higher after aortic valvuloplasty or radiofrequency catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation.

All included studies performed neurologic examinations and brain MRI both pre-and post-procedure. Among 833 patients who had diagnostic cardiac catheterization, the incidence of asymptomatic radiographic brain infarcts was 8 percent (95% CI 4.1&ndash;12), while the incidence of clinically symptomatic events (ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack) was 0.6 percent (95% CI 0.1&ndash;1.1).</p><p>Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography studies reveal an even higher prevalence (up to 100 percent) of microemboli during cardiac catheterization procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-after-cardiac-catheterization/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. The majority of these microemboli occur during contrast injection, while a smaller number are observed with movement of the <span class=\"nowrap\">catheter/guide</span> wire. Most of the signals that are seen with injection of solutions have profiles consistent with gaseous origin (eg, air bubbles) and are thought to be of no clinical consequence, whereas the microembolic signals that occur during catheter and guide wire manipulation have signal profiles consistent with particulate origin (eg, atheromatous debris), and could result in transient or persistent ischemic brain injury. Nevertheless, most patients are asymptomatic. These observations suggest that catheter manipulation in the diseased aortic root releases small pieces of atherosclerotic debris more commonly than suspected, based upon the low incidence of clinically apparent stroke. (See <a href=\"#H195524811\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms'</a> above.)</p><p>In a report of 47 unselected patients in whom transcranial Doppler was used to detect microemboli and MRI to detect new lesions, the median number of solid (ie, not gaseous) microemboli was significantly higher with a transradial compared with a transfemoral access (57 versus 36). New MRI lesions occurred in 5 of 33 patients (15 percent) after transradial catheterization, compared with 0 of 9 after transfemoral catheterization.

Frequent manifestations of ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage include visual disturbance, aphasia, dysarthria, hemiparesis, and altered mental status. In contrast, subarachnoid hemorrhage usually presents with headache and global neurologic deficits, mainly altered level of consciousness. A maximal deficit at onset or a fluctuating course suggest ischemic stroke, while gradual worsening of neurologic deficits over minutes to hours and signs of elevated intracranial pressure suggest hemorrhage. However, clinical features alone do not reliably distinguish brain ischemia from hemorrhage, necessitating neuroimaging.</p><p>The symptoms and signs of acute ischemic stroke often correspond to recognized stroke syndromes with focal neurologic deficits attributable to ischemia within a vascular territory affecting the cerebral cortex (eg, aphasia and left hemiparesis related to embolic occlusion within the left middle cerebral artery territory), brainstem, or cerebellum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical diagnosis of stroke subtypes&quot;</a>.) Monocular visual loss may be caused by retinal embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-after-cardiac-catheterization/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Some data suggest that a disproportionate number of ischemic strokes related to cardiac catheterization affect the vertebrobasilar circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-after-cardiac-catheterization/abstract/28,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,35,36</a>], but other reports suggest that the rate of posterior circulation ischemic stroke is close to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-after-cardiac-catheterization/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], as might be expected given the percentage of blood that the posterior circulation supplies to the brain. In addition to focal deficits, a nonfocal presentation of ischemic stroke with reduced alertness and encephalopathy can occur as a result of diffuse bilateral cerebral embolization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523090596\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of the patient who is undergoing or who has recently undergone cardiac catheterization and who is suspected of an acute stroke is presented briefly here. Acute stroke evaluation is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial assessment and management of acute stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Important aspects of the evaluation of any patient with periprocedural neurologic deterioration suggestive of stroke include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid activation of the stroke team.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Checking serum glucose, as symptoms of hypoglycemia may mimic stroke; low serum glucose (&lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [&lt;3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> should be corrected rapidly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelet count and coagulation studies if there is suspicion for thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determining symptom onset time or the last time the patient was known to be neurologically normal.

However, caution should be taken not to delay stroke treatment (if indicated) in order to obtain additional tests.</p><p/><p>We recommend brain imaging with CT or MRI to rule out hemorrhage as a standard approach. In contrast, some experts have advocated immediate angiography followed by intra-arterial thrombolysis rather than obtaining a head CT or MRI after an acute stroke from cardiac catheterization, because the time needed for brain imaging may significantly delay treatment of a vessel occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-after-cardiac-catheterization/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, this approach would require a high level of confidence that intracranial hemorrhage is not causing the stroke symptoms, that any identified vessel occlusion is acute and responsible for the symptoms, and that the risk of hemorrhagic transformation of the acute ischemic stroke is low (eg, the diagnostic procedure was done without the use of full-dose anticoagulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> glycoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> inhibitors). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H206677030\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of acute stroke in this setting includes transient ischemic attack, seizure, migraine, encephalopathy, and toxic-metabolic disturbances such as hypoglycemia. In some cases, the recognition of stroke deficits can be confounded by altered mentation caused by sedative medications used for the procedure or by comorbid medical or neurologic conditions.</p><p>An additional but rare consideration in the periprocedural period is that of contrast-induced transient cortical blindness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-after-cardiac-catheterization/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>], which can occur with ionic and nonionic contrast media. Onset is seen within minutes to hours after the procedure, typically beginning with blurred vision that rapidly progresses to complete blindness, usually associated with headache. Additional symptoms may include vomiting, confusion, aphasia, memory impairment, and limb weakness or ataxia. On head computed tomography (CT) performed without additional contrast, there is often enhancement from contrast administered during cardiac catheterization affecting the cortex, particularly the parieto-occipital lobes, as well as the deep gray structures, brainstem, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cerebellum. Symmetrical white matter edema in the posterior cerebral hemispheres is another frequent finding. In one affected patient evaluated with brain magnetic resonance imaging, hyperintense signal on T2-weighted sequences was seen in the occipital lobes, thalami, and cerebellum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-after-cardiac-catheterization/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In nearly all cases, the neurologic impairments and neuroimaging abnormalities gradually resolve over days. Although the mechanism is uncertain, a transient vasculopathy with disruption of the blood-brain barrier is postulated, suggesting that this is a form of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), also called reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-after-cardiac-catheterization/abstract/39,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,41,42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reversible-posterior-leukoencephalopathy-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to being associated with the signs and symptoms described above, extravasation of contrast after coronary angiography can sometimes mimic the appearance of subarachnoid hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-after-cardiac-catheterization/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>] and intracerebral hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-after-cardiac-catheterization/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>] on noncontrast head CT scan.</p><p>Although visual loss after cardiac catheterization has usually been related to contrast, and therefore reversible, bilateral occipital lobe infarction in this setting may present in a similar manner and must be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-after-cardiac-catheterization/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5651061\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of ischemic stroke is dependent on the time elapsed from stroke onset. As discussed below, we suggest intravenous thrombolytic therapy for eligible patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71462\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71462 \">table 2</a>) with ischemic stroke in the setting of cardiac catheterization who can be treated within 4.5 hours of stroke onset. However, despite the evidence of benefit in many patients, the risk of bleeding is relatively high in these patients compared with the broad population of patients with ischemic stroke due to the recent use of aggressive antithrombotic therapy as well as the potential for significant procedure site and device related (eg, retroperitoneal) bleeding. The benefits and risks of intravenous thrombolytic therapy need to be weighed carefully in potential candidates.</p><p>Options for patients who are ineligible for intravenous thrombolysis involve intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy and intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy (within 6 hours of onset). For ischemic stroke, the goal should be to initiate reperfusion therapy within one hour and preferably sooner from the time that symptoms are first noted. </p><p>For patients with hemorrhagic stroke (ie, intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage), urgent management issues involve reversal of anticoagulation when feasible, blood pressure control, and treatment of elevated intracranial pressure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5651069\"><span class=\"h2\">Ischemic stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stroke caused by embolization of fresh thrombus forming on the catheter or guidewire would seem to be ideally suited to thrombolytic treatment. However, theoretical concerns about the utility of thrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke after cardiac catheterization are based upon the possible composition of some other types of thrombi causing stroke in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-after-cardiac-catheterization/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. For example, dislodged debris from aortic atherosclerotic plaque might be made up primarily of calcific material and therefore not responsive to thrombolysis, or calcific thrombus might undergo partial lysis leading to distal migration of calcific fragments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-after-cardiac-catheterization/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In addition, air embolism and metallic fragments would be impervious to thrombolytic agents. </p><p>Despite these concerns, data from a retrospective, multicenter, observational study evaluating ischemic stroke after cardiac catheterization suggest that tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is safe and efficacious in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-after-cardiac-catheterization/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Among 66 consecutive cases of ischemic stroke after cardiac catheterization, 12 patients were treated acutely with thrombolysis (7 with intravenous tPA and 5 with intra-arterial tPA), while 54 received no thrombolysis. Patient demographics (age, medical comorbidities, and cardiac procedure characteristics) were similar between the thrombolysis and no thrombolysis groups.
