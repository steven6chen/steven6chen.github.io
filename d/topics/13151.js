TMA is a pathologic diagnosis made by tissue biopsy. However, it is commonly inferred from the observation of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and thrombocytopenia in the appropriate clinical setting. Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) was the first of the primary TMAs to be described and is perhaps the best understood of the TMAs pathophysiologically. TTP is unique among the primary TMAs for minimal abnormalities of kidney function, despite microthrombi observed throughout the kidney.</p><p>The pathophysiology of acquired (autoimmune) TTP, complement-mediated TMA, Shiga toxin-induced TMA (hemolytic uremic syndrome [ST-HUS]), and some of the rare inherited TMAs will be reviewed here.</p><p>The pathophysiology of hereditary TTP and drug-induced TMA (also called drug-induced TTP) is presented separately.

In the primary TMAs, an inherited or acquired defect promotes formation of platelet microthrombi in the microvasculature. TMA is characterized by small vessel changes including swelling of endothelial cells and the subendothelial space, along with vessel wall thickening and platelet microthrombi, typically in small arterioles and capillaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-acquired-ttp-and-other-primary-thrombotic-microangiopathies-tmas/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. These changes can obliterate the vessel lumen, especially in smaller vessels, and lead to hyaline occlusion. In some cases, endothelial cell proliferation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vessel wall dilatation (eg, microaneurysms) have been seen in the affected arterioles.</p><p>Unlike the pathophysiology of DIC, in the primary TMAs the thrombi are composed primarily of platelets and von Willebrand factor rather than red blood cells (RBCs) and fibrin. Large vessel thrombosis is not typical of TTP or other primary TMAs.</p><p>Similar histologic findings of TMA may also be seen in other disorders such as malignant hypertension, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, antiphospholipid syndrome, and kidney transplant rejection.</p><p>Examples of the typical sites of organ involvement include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Kidney</strong> &ndash; Kidney involvement by TMA is typical of all primary TMA syndromes. Severe acute kidney injury is a prominent feature of all primary TMA syndromes except TTP, in which it is rare. Pathologic changes in the kidney include thrombi in the arterioles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F54840\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54840 \">picture 1</a>) and glomeruli (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63511\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63511 \">picture 2</a>). Urinary findings are nonspecific and may include hematuria, hemoglobinuria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteinuria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These pathologic changes are similar for all of the TMAs; however, they may be helpful in distinguishing between a TMA and other causes of renal failure with a nondiagnostic urine sediment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-acquired-ttp-and-other-primary-thrombotic-microangiopathies-tmas/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Clinical features of neurologic involvement may be most common in patients with TTP. Neurologic manifestations may be mild, with headache and transient confusion, or severe, with tonic-clonic seizures, stroke, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> coma. Focal abnormalities are common in TTP, including episodes of numbness or weakness localized to an arm or hand or side of the face, or transient aphasia or vision impairment.</p><p/><p>Similar TMA lesions of the microvasculature in the heart, skin, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gastrointestinal tract are inferred from clinical findings such as acute coronary syndrome, purpuric skin lesions, and gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea). An exception is pulmonary involvement, which is rarely clinically evident despite microvascular thrombi in the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-acquired-ttp-and-other-primary-thrombotic-microangiopathies-tmas/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Autopsy of patients who have died with an acute episode of TTP demonstrates microvascular thrombi characteristic of TTP in almost all organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-acquired-ttp-and-other-primary-thrombotic-microangiopathies-tmas/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2626376\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematologic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematologic findings are the same in TTP and other primary TMA syndromes. The characteristic and constant feature is microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). Some degree of thrombocytopenia also occurs in all primary TMAs.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>MAHA</strong> &ndash; MAHA is caused by mechanical RBC fragmentation that occurs as RBCs traverse platelet-rich thrombi in the microcirculation. The result of RBC fragmentation is schistocytes, which typically are prominent on the peripheral blood smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81610\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81610 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thrombocytopenia</strong> &ndash; Thrombocytopenia is due to platelet consumption in microthrombi throughout the microcirculation. Thrombocytopenia may be only mild or moderate in many of the primary TMA syndromes, but in patients with TTP it is typically severe (platelet count often <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;10,000/microL)</span>.</p><p/><p>Bone marrow evaluation <span class=\"nowrap\">(aspiration/biopsy)</span> typically is not performed in TTP or other primary TMAs. If it is performed, it shows normal trilineage maturation with increased thrombopoiesis and erythropoiesis to compensate for consumption of platelets and RBCs in the peripheral circulation. A bone marrow evaluation is appropriate when the clinical features of a primary TMA are not clear and an alternative diagnosis such as a systemic malignancy is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-acquired-ttp-and-other-primary-thrombotic-microangiopathies-tmas/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The white blood cell (WBC) count is normal in primary TMAs; leukocytosis or leukocytopenia suggests that another disorder such as myelodysplasia, systemic malignancy, or megaloblastic anemia is responsible for abnormalities of RBC morphology and thrombocytopenia.</p><p>Abnormalities of coagulation are uncommon in TTP and other primary TMAs. This is a major clinical feature that distinguishes primary TMAs from other causes of MAHA and thrombocytopenia such as systemic infection or malignancy, which are often associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC is characterized by prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), increased D-dimer, and reduced fibrinogen. In occasional patients with TTP, organ ischemia may be severe enough to cause DIC, but this is rare.

ADAMTS13 is a plasma protease that was initially defined by its function as a von Willebrand factor (VWF)-cleaving protease. It cleaves the ultralarge, string-like molecules of VWF that are synthesized by endothelial cells and secreted into the plasma but remain attached to the endothelial surface. This normal cleavage to smaller sized multimers prevents ultralarge multimers from accumulating, especially in areas of high shear stress (eg, small arterioles and capillaries). Shear stress leads to a conformational change in the large VWF multimers that exposes the ADAMTS13 cleavage site. When protease activity is reduced, ultralarge VWF multimers accumulate on the endothelial surface, where platelets attach and accumulate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-acquired-ttp-and-other-primary-thrombotic-microangiopathies-tmas/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

In contrast, modest reductions may occur in a variety of medical conditions such as sepsis or liver disease and are not thought to cause clinical disease. Use of ADAMTS13 activity testing in the diagnosis of TTP is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Reduced ADAMTS13 activity'</a>.)</p><p>However, a severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity alone is not sufficient to cause TTP. Patients with severe, hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency may have no signs or symptoms of TTP until they are adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-acquired-ttp-and-other-primary-thrombotic-microangiopathies-tmas/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Further, some individuals with severe acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency due to an autoantibody continue to have severe deficiency in remission without clinical findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-acquired-ttp-and-other-primary-thrombotic-microangiopathies-tmas/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. These observations suggest that additional factors such as an acute inflammatory or prothrombotic stimulus may be responsible for triggering clinical manifestations.</p><p>Alternatively, the fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin may substitute for ADAMTS13 in cleaving ultralarge VWF multimers from forming and in preventing the pathologic process of platelet thrombosis in patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. This is suggested by the observation that plasmin can degrade vascular obstructing platelet complexes associated with strings of ultralarge VWF multimers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-acquired-ttp-and-other-primary-thrombotic-microangiopathies-tmas/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The potential therapeutic use of plasmin was suggested in a preclinical (mouse) model of <em>ADAMTS13</em> gene deletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-acquired-ttp-and-other-primary-thrombotic-microangiopathies-tmas/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].
