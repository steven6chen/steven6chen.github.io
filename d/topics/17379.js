These are areas of soft tissue in the back of the throat. An adenoidectomy is surgery to remove the adenoids. Adenoids are also areas of soft tissue in the throat. They are located higher up than the tonsils.</p><p>Doctors can do just a tonsillectomy, just an adenoidectomy, or both. The type of surgery depends on the symptoms and other factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258895497\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might a child need a tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a few reasons. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing &ndash; Swollen tonsils or adenoids can keep a child from breathing normally through the mouth or nose. If someone stops breathing for short periods during sleep, doctors call it &quot;sleep apnea.&quot; It can be dangerous.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble swallowing normally</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many throat or ear infections &ndash; If other treatments do not help, a child might need surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A growth on the tonsils</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258895512\"><span class=\"h1\">What do tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy involve?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before surgery, your child's doctor will give you instructions about what to do. Children should not eat or drink for a certain number of hours before surgery.</p><p>Most children can go home a few hours after surgery. The doctor will tell you if your child needs to stay overnight for any reason.</p><p>Just before the surgery starts, the doctor will give your child medicine to make him or her fall asleep. Then the doctor will take out the tonsils, adenoids, or both.</p><p>Your child might have an upset stomach and throw up for 1 or 2 days. He or she will also have a very sore throat for a few days. A child who has just an adenoidectomy usually has less pain and feels better faster after surgery.</p><p>Children need to stay home from school for a few days after surgery. The doctor will tell you when your child can go back to school.</p><p>Your child should avoid sports and very active play for at least 2 weeks. He or she should stay away from people with colds, coughs, and the flu for 2 weeks after surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258895527\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to help my child feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help your child feel better after surgery, you can give him or her:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plenty of liquids</strong> &ndash; Such as water, grape juice, broth, or an &quot;oral rehydration solution&quot; (sample brand name: Pedialyte) that you buy in a store or pharmacy. Your child might not feel like drinking, but it's important that he or she gets enough liquids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medicines</strong> &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) can help with throat pain. The correct dose depends on your child's weight, so ask your child's doctor how much to give.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Do not give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> or medicines that contain aspirin to children younger than 18 years. In children, aspirin can cause a serious problem called Reye syndrome. Aspirin also increases the risk of bleeding after surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Foods that are easy to swallow</strong> &ndash; Such as soft bread, Jell-O, mashed potatoes, pudding, and applesauce.</p><p/><p><strong>Do not give</strong> your child citrus juices, such as orange or grapefruit juice, and do not give your child foods that are hard, scratchy, spicy, or acidic. These juices and foods can irritate your child's throat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258895542\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my child's doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After surgery, call your child's doctor or nurse if your child:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has bright red blood coming from the nose or throat &ndash; A little blood in saliva or vomit is normal after surgery. If you see a lot of bright red blood, take your child to the hospital right away.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannot drink liquids</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has vomiting that does not get better</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gets a fever</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a severe sore throat or ear pain that doesn't get better after a week or two or gets worse</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258895557\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anesthesia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-tubes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ear tubes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=eustachian-tube-problems-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Eustachian tube problems (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=strep-throat-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Strep throat in children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-infections-otitis-media-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ear infections (otitis media) in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sore-throat-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sore throat in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
