Over the past few decades, professional allergy societies in the United States have made attempts to reduce variations in practice and identify best approaches. Practice parameters for SCIT have been published, and the approach described in this topic review is consistent with the American guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10981157\"><span class=\"h2\">Terminology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An allergen immunotherapy extract is a solution of one or more allergens that is used for immunotherapy. This topic review will use the term &quot;allergen immunotherapy extract&quot; or &quot;allergen extract,&quot; although other terms in use include &quot;allergy serum,&quot; &quot;allergen vaccine,&quot; &quot;allergen solution,&quot; and &quot;allergen product&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The preparation of allergen extracts for use in SCIT, including effective doses, types of extracts, mixing of different allergens, training of compounding personnel, storage and stability, and recording of vaccine &quot;recipes&quot; will be discussed in this topic review. Administration techniques, schedules, and choice of allergens, as well as an overview of the manufacture of allergen extracts are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-aeroallergen-immunotherapy-accelerated-schedules-cluster-and-rush\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous aeroallergen immunotherapy: Accelerated schedules (cluster and rush)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergen-extracts-composition-manufacture-and-labeling\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergen extracts: Composition, manufacture, and labeling&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24981640\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF ALLERGEN EXTRACTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several types of allergen stock solutions are available from commercial sources in the United States. The allergen may be in an aqueous solution, a solution containing 50 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycerin</a>, in an alum-precipitated form, or lyophilized. The manufacture of allergen extracts is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergen-extracts-composition-manufacture-and-labeling\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergen extracts: Composition, manufacture, and labeling&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H440780\" class=\"local\">'Dilutions and diluents'</a> below.)</p><p>A specific allergen may only be available in a limited number of forms. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most pollens are available in either aqueous solutions or 50 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycerin</a> solutions. Glycerin is a stabilizing and bacteriostatic agent, but it can cause pain at the injection site in a dose-dependent manner. The standardized extracts of house dust mites, cat dander, and grasses are only available in 50 percent glycerin. Some pollens are also available in an alum-precipitated formulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fungal (mold), fire ant, and cockroach extracts are often available in aqueous or 50 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycerin</a> solutions, but only the 50 percent glycerin should be used because solutions containing less glycerin are prone to autodigestion due to the relative abundance of degradative enzymes that naturally occur in these substances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is only one line of alum-precipitated extracts approved in the United States and only pollen extracts are available in this line. Alum-precipitated extracts are less prone to cause systemic reactions due to retarded systemic absorption from the injection site. The disadvantage of the available alum-precipitated extracts is that they contain less allergen than concentrated aqueous or glycerinated pollen extracts, thus limiting the number of extracts that can be combined in an allergen immunotherapy extract and still deliver an optimal dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dog extracts exist in aqueous and glycerinated forms, although only the acetone-precipitated (AP dog) product has been shown to be sufficiently potent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The only lyophilized products are the Hymenoptera venoms.</p><p/><p>Aside from the exceptions mentioned above (AP dog and alum-precipitated pollen extracts), there is no compelling scientific reason to favor one company over another as a source of allergen extracts.</p><p>Glycerinated, aqueous, and alum-precipitated extracts can be mixed, provided there are no compatibility issues. (See <a href=\"#H24981603\" class=\"local\">'Compatibility of allergen extracts'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2162192\"><span class=\"h2\">Standardized</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standardized extracts are preferred over nonstandardized extracts, although standardized extracts are not available for all allergens. Standardization refers to the way in which an allergen extract is produced and takes into account multiple factors, such as selection and collection of raw materials, extract preparation, storage, validation of assays, and reagents for batch-to-batch control. Standardization is intended to minimize variations in the composition and quality of allergen in the final product. The processes involved in standardization are reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergen-extracts-composition-manufacture-and-labeling#H1361734777\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergen extracts: Composition, manufacture, and labeling&quot;, section on 'Standardization of allergen extracts'</a>.)</p><p>Standardized extracts offer the advantage of consistent potency, although a certain degree of variability is allowed. However, although they are consistent in content of major allergen or overall allergenicity (depending on which was the basis for standardization), there is no attempt to ensure consistency in the relative contents of minor allergens. Despite these limitations, standardized extracts are preferred over nonstandardized extracts.</p><p>At the time of this review, the available standardized extracts are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cat hair or pelt</strong> (expressed as bioequivalent allergy units <span class=\"nowrap\">[BAU]/mL),</span> which is standardized by the content of the major allergen, Fel d 1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><em>Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus</em></strong><strong> and </strong><strong><em>D. farinae</em></strong> (expressed as allergy units <span class=\"nowrap\">[AU]/mL),</span> which were initially standardized by quantitative skin testing in highly allergic subjects and subsequently standardized to the reference extract by in vitro methods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Short ragweed</strong> (expressed as weight of extracted material divided by amount of extracting fluid <span class=\"nowrap\">[w/v],</span> but with the major allergen content listed on the label), which is standardized by the content of the major allergen, Amb a 1. The concentrated short ragweed is also considered to be 100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">AU/mL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bermuda grass and related northern pasture grasses</strong> (Timothy, Kentucky Blue, Perennial Rye, Orchard, Meadow Fescue, Redtop, and Sweet Vernal) expressed as <span class=\"nowrap\">BAU/mL,</span> which were initially standardized by quantitative skin testing in highly allergic subjects and subsequently standardized to the reference extract by in vitro methods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hymenoptera venoms</strong> (yellow jacket, honey bee, wasp, yellow hornet, and white-faced hornet) are expressed as micrograms of venom <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/mL</span> and standardized on the basis of a venom protein content of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> for individual species and 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> for the mixed vespids.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H624134685\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonstandardized</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The remaining pollens (ie, all tree pollens, weed pollens except short ragweed), animal dander (all except cat), insect (eg, cockroach and imported fire ant), and fungal extracts are not standardized. The potency of nonstandardized extracts is expressed as weight of extracted material divided by amount of extracting fluid <span class=\"nowrap\">(w/v)</span> or in terms of protein nitrogen units (PNU). These units have been shown to have little or no relationship to allergenic potency. Hence, nonstandardized extracts labeled as the same strength cannot be assumed to be of similar potency, either between companies or on a lot-to-lot basis within a company. This lot-to-lot variation in potency is important when preparing a replacement allergen immunotherapy extract. A more potent extract can lead to a systemic reaction unless the dose is appropriately reduced. When changing from an older to a newer vial of immunotherapy extract, it is customary to reduce the patient's dose by one-half (eg, from 0.5 mL of maintenance to 0.25 mL), even though the same extracts from the same provider are used to compound the new extract. The dose can then be built back up to the dose the patient was previously receiving. This is done because the fresh vials may be more potent due to gradual degradation of proteins in the old vials or variations in allergen content among different lots of extract. The various units used in labeling allergen extracts are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergen-extracts-composition-manufacture-and-labeling#H1361734073\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergen extracts: Composition, manufacture, and labeling&quot;, section on 'Units of measure'</a>.)</p><p>Since nonstandardized and standardized pollen extracts are of similar potency, they can be presumed to be clinically effective, even when randomized, controlled studies have not been performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2162127\"><span class=\"h1\">DOSING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effectiveness of SCIT is dose-dependent. The optimal dose or dose range is specific to each type of allergen and varies significantly among allergens. Optimal doses have been determined for many of the major inhalant allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Information about effective doses is presented separately for standardized and nonstandardized allergens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F54949\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54949 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F69763\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69763 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15449532\"><span class=\"h2\">Standardized allergens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doses of individual standardized allergens that produce clinically effective results in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are known for the standardized allergens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F54949\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54949 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The following points should be noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some cases, lower doses that are <strong>ineffective</strong> are known from trial data.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For many of these extracts, no studies have been conducted with the standardized extracts available in the United States. Some standardized extracts in the United States do list amounts of major allergen in micrograms in the package insert, but others do not (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F54949\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54949 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These values are based in most cases on analysis of dozens of extracts from all manufacturers in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. If information about the amount of major allergen in micrograms in a particular lot of extract is not available, then this information about average content can be used instead.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The potency of the pollen extracts (which are manufactured from relatively pure samples of pollen), as reflected in their allergy units (AU) or bioequivalent allergy units (BAU) values, is approximately 10 times greater in major allergen content compared with extracts of perennial allergens, such as house dust mites and cat.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15449539\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonstandardized allergens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data on effective doses and examples of major allergens are given in the table for a number of nonstandardized extracts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F69763\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69763 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It should be noted that the nonstandardized pollens are generally in the same range of potency as the standardized pollens.</p><p>Because of the relatively low content of major allergen in nonstandardized extracts of cockroach, fungi, and aqueous preparations of dog dander, it is uncertain whether clinically effective doses can be attained with these extracts. However, there are unblinded <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> uncontrolled studies reporting patient outcomes with cockroach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and horse dander [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] immunotherapy using available extracts. In contrast, in comparison with conventional extract, acetone-precipitated (AP) dog extract is sufficiently potent to achieve effective dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15449627\"><span class=\"h1\">CREATING A MAINTENANCE EXTRACT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Available studies about optimal dosing form the basis of recommendations in immunotherapy practice parameters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78503\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78503 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The doses recommended in the practice parameters are based upon challenge studies (when available), literature review, and expert panel clinical experience.</p><p>An allergen immunotherapy extract should be prepared so that the maintenance concentration delivers a dose of each allergen that has been demonstrated to be clinically effective (called the maintenance goal). This is typically delivered in a volume of 0.2 to 0.7 mL, although the lower end of this volume range is preferred if the maintenance solution contains significant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycerin</a>. Specifically, extract manufacturers advise administering no more than 0.2 mL of a 50 percent glycerin solution to avoid pain at the injection site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Allergen immunotherapy dosing is not adjusted for patient size or age. Children have customarily been given the same dose as adults. Some patients may not tolerate this dose due to repeated large local or systemic reactions. In this situation, the patient's highest tolerated dose becomes <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> maintenance dose.</p><p>To prepare a 10 mL vial of Timothy grass maintenance extract, one would proceed as follows: If a 0.5 mL maintenance volume were desired, then a 10 mL vial would contain 20 doses. Based on the recommended effective dose for Timothy grass, which is 3000 BAU (bioequivalent allergy units), the vial should contain 20 x 3000 or 60,000 BAU. Since the Timothy extract comes as 100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">BAU/mL,</span> 0.6 mL of the full-strength Timothy extract would be placed in the 10 mL vial. The remaining 9.4 mL would be diluent if the patient were only receiving Timothy, or the diluent could be partially replaced by other compatible allergen extracts in appropriate amounts, if the patient required treatment with multiple allergens. This would be the full-strength maintenance solution. Serial dilutions to be used during the build-up phase would then be prepared from this maintenance concentration. (See <a href=\"#H15449436\" class=\"local\">'Multiple allergen immunotherapy extracts'</a> below.)</p><p>For clinicians who do not wish to mix patient allergen extracts, &quot;treatment sets&quot; can be prepared and purchased through extract manufacturers. The clinician must write a prescription for the specific allergens and amounts that are to be included for that patient's therapy.</p><p>Dosing of Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy and fire ant immunotherapy is somewhat different from that of the aeroallergens and is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Technical issues, protocols, adverse effects, and monitoring&quot;, section on 'Dosing'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stings of imported fire ants: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Venom immunotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>Recommendations have been made for creating maintenance concentrations from nonstandardized extracts, although these are based upon limited data:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For nonstandardized pollens, a target dose of 0.5 mL of a 1:100 or 1:200 <span class=\"nowrap\">weight/volume</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(w/v)</span> solution is reasonable, which is achieved by adding 1 mL of the full-strength (1:10 or 1:20 <span class=\"nowrap\">w/v)</span> extract to a 10 mL vial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For nonstandardized fungal (mold) and cockroach allergens, only glycerinated extracts can be recommended and amounts added should be greater than for pollens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is uncertain if sufficient amounts of these weak extracts can be administered to be clinically effective. Many clinicians will add the maximum amount possible. These extracts should not be combined with pollen, house dust mite, or dog or cat dander extracts, nor should fugal and cockroach allergen extracts be combined in the same vial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only acetone-precipitated dog extract (AP dog) can be recommended for immunotherapy. AP dog comes as a 1:100 <span class=\"nowrap\">w/v</span> stock solution, and the recommended maintenance dose is 0.04 to 0.19 mL, so if an intermediate dose of 0.1 mL is selected, 2 mL of the stock solution would be added to the 10 mL vial.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15449436\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiple allergen immunotherapy extracts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients placed on immunotherapy are sensitized to multiple allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. In the United States, the use of immunotherapy solutions containing multiple allergens is the rule, while in many other countries, patients are treated with the single allergen to which the patient shows greatest sensitivity. Both methods have been shown to be effective in randomized, controlled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. However, direct, head-to-head studies comparing the two approaches are lacking. In a large, randomized trial of patients receiving grass SCIT, both monosensitized and polysensitized patients benefited to a similar degree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

At lower concentrations, glycerin is less effective as a bacteriostatic agent, and phenol should be added. At 10 percent, glycerin may provide some protection against loss of extract potency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15449480\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other important issues to consider when prescribing or producing maintenance extracts include cross-allergenicity among allergens, compatibility of different allergens, and individual vials versus shared extracts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24981596\"><span class=\"h2\">Cross-allergenicity among allergens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are clusters of related allergens that are sufficiently similar that just one of the group is required to generate immunologic changes to the entire group. These clinically relevant cross-reacting allergens are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F56544\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56544 \">table 5</a>). In this situation, one of two approaches is appropriate:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most locally important allergen may be used alone as a representative of the group</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">OR</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mixture of the cross-reacting allergens can be substituted for a single allergen extract</p><p/><p>The local prevalence of allergenic plants can be determined from field observation or contacting local extension services or allergen extract manufacturers. In addition, (in the United States) the <a href=\"http://www.aaaai.org/global/nab-pollen-counts.aspx&amp;token=Ot8eMgkF7sWfreqfa3+cy0aO4IBlVlYmIMNCEtC+G7Fvy9A25LKyTwWkLiueKtU8mA1RTJGZW2xAMu3IoHyFLA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=13527\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Allergy Board (NAB)</a> can provide local pollen counts if there is a counting station in the vicinity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24981603\"><span class=\"h2\">Compatibility of allergen extracts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fungal (mold) and cockroach extracts contain proteases that can degrade other types of allergens. Therefore, they should not be mixed with each other or with other allergens in the same treatment vials. It is unclear if degraded allergens are less effective for immunotherapy, but there is also a safety issue. Degradation can reduce the ability of allergens to react with allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), so there is a potential risk that a patient who was receiving degraded allergens and is then exposed to a new vial of freshly mixed allergens could suffer a systemic allergic reaction.</p><p>The following applies to mixing of extracts within treatment vials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fungal and cockroach extracts should <strong>not</strong> be mixed with pollen, house dust mite, or animal danders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>] or with each other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus, fungal and cockroach extracts should not contain any other types of allergens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>House dust mite, animal danders, and pollens can be mixed with each other.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24981610\"><span class=\"h2\">Individual versus shared allergen immunotherapy extracts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immunotherapy practice parameters recommend individually prepared and labeled vials in preference to shared vials used for multiple patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Potential advantages of patient-specific vials include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower risk of administering the wrong solution because the vial can be labeled with specific patient identifiers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The need for less frequent mixing and turnover of vials, since only one patient is using a given set of vials.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The extracts can be more precisely tailored to an individual patient's sensitivity. Shared vials commonly use mixes of allergens (eg, mixed trees, mixed weeds) that may have components to which the patient is not sensitized, thus diluting the amount of allergen relevant to that patient.</p><p/><p>However, the clinical efficacy and safety of shared versus individual vials has not been formally studied.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H440727\"><span class=\"h2\">Mixing extracts in a syringe before administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The practice of mixing allergen extracts in a syringe just before administration to a patient is not recommended, because it increases the risk of cross-contamination of the vials from which the extracts are withdrawn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H440760\"><span class=\"h1\">STORAGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once an allergen immunotherapy extract has been formulated, it should be stored at all times when not in use at 4&deg;C (39&deg;F). Storage should be in a dedicated refrigerator and not one used for food or specimens.</p><p>There are few studies that have evaluated the maintenance of potency of dilutions over time, although the results of one study are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F69332\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69332 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The results suggest six-month expiration dates for these dilutions and even shorter periods for greater dilutions. Extracts in 50 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycerin</a> retain potency much longer than aqueous solutions, and this is reflected in the expiration date. The expiration date of the maintenance concentrate is that of the earliest expiration date for any of the component allergen extracts. Dilutions of the allergen immunotherapy extract degrade more readily, and the greater the dilution, the more rapid the loss of potency. This loss is reduced by the use of 0.03 percent human serum albumin (HSA) or at least 10 percent glycerin in the diluent. (See <a href=\"#H706228110\" class=\"local\">'Diluent options'</a> above.)</p><p>The recommendations for expiration of dilutions of Hymenoptera venom (from time of reconstitution) are: 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL:</span> 12 months, 1 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL:</span> one month, 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL:</span> two weeks, and &lt;0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL:</span> prepare fresh daily.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2224655\"><span class=\"h2\">Transport of extracts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergen extracts that have been made for a specific patient can be transported by the patient with relative ease.

In the United States, most allergens are commercially available as aqueous or glycerinated solutions. Exceptions include a line of alum-precipitated pollens, acetone-precipitated dog (AP dog), and lyophilized Hymenoptera venoms. (See <a href=\"#H24981640\" class=\"local\">'Types of allergen extracts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standardized allergens are more consistent in their potency and are thus preferred over nonstandardized allergens when available. In the United States, only cat pelt and hair, house dust mite, short ragweed, grasses, and Hymenoptera venoms are available in standardized forms. (See <a href=\"#H15449532\" class=\"local\">'Standardized allergens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effectiveness of SCIT is dose-dependent. The optimal dose or dose range is specific to each type of allergen and varies significantly among allergens. Optimal doses have been determined for many of the major inhalant allergens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F54949\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54949 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F69763\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69763 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doses are not adjusted for the age or size of the patient. (See <a href=\"#H2162127\" class=\"local\">'Dosing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunotherapy practice parameters provide recommended doses for maintenance immunotherapy with various standardized and nonstandardized allergens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78503\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78503 \">table 3</a>). In the United States, it is common to administer SCIT with a mixture of several allergens, although this is not the practice in much of the rest of the world, and the two approaches have not been compared directly. (See <a href=\"#H15449436\" class=\"local\">'Multiple allergen immunotherapy extracts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When mixing an allergen extract for use in SCIT, it is important to understand cross-allergenicity among similar allergens and compatibility among different allergens. (See <a href=\"#H15449480\" class=\"local\">'Other considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergen extracts should be stored at 4&deg;C (39&deg;F). The length of time that an extract can be stored is mainly determined by its concentration, since more dilute extracts are the least stable. (See <a href=\"#H440760\" class=\"local\">'Storage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personnel involved in mixing allergen extracts should undergo training and fulfill various requirements to document satisfactory techniques.
