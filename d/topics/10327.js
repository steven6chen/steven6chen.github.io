Serum concentrations of acetaminophen in this setting do not correlate with toxicity and the treatment nomogram for acetaminophen poisoning should <strong>not</strong> be used. Establishing the diagnosis of chronic acetaminophen poisoning frequently involves exclusion of other causes of clinical hepatitis.

(See <a href=\"#H12865251\" class=\"local\">'Additional resources'</a> below.)</p><p>The approach to overdose with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> is based upon case reports and expert opinion and is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Some medical toxicologists recommend treatment of all children who receive an intravenous dose &gt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Furthermore, critics of the conservative position note that intravenous acetaminophen administration avoids the first pass effect and is likely to result in less production of the toxic metabolite, n-amino-p-benzoquinoneimine in the liver, despite a higher peak concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Management focuses on decontamination with activated charcoal (AC) and administration of the acetaminophen antidote, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as modified by specific types of exposure.

However, endotracheal intubation should not be performed solely for the purpose of giving AC. Asymptomatic patients who present more than four hours after reported <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> ingestions are unlikely to benefit from AC, and we do <strong>not</strong> recommend routine treatment in these patients. However, AC may be useful beyond four hours in the presence of certain coingestants that may delay absorption of acetaminophen (eg, sustained-release preparations or agents that slows gut motility such as anticholinergic agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diphenhydramine</a>, or opioids).</p><p>A number of studies using simulated overdose models in adults have shown that AC reduces <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> exposure and peak acetaminophen levels maximally when given within one hour of ingestion, and that this reduction in acetaminophen absorption is not significant when AC is given four hours after ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Several observational studies primarily performed in adult and adolescent patients with acute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> overdose support these findings but also suggest a benefit for AC administration beyond one hour:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 981 consecutive patients with an acute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> overdose, patients who received AC within two hours of ingestion were less likely to require N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another prospective observational study of 145 patients who presented over four hours after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> ingestion and had serum levels in the probable toxicity range on the treatment nomogram for acetaminophen poisoning, administration of AC with NAC was significantly associated with fewer patients attaining peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations &gt;1000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> when compared to treatment with NAC alone (2 versus 36 percent, respectively). These effects were independent of the time of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetylcysteine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetylcysteine</a> administration.

Although there is insufficient experience with this treatment in younger patients to evaluate the impact on survival, liver transplantation should also be offered to children. Clinical and laboratory criteria have been developed for adults that identify patients with fulminant hepatic failure who are unlikely to survive and should therefore be considered for liver transplantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77717\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77717 \">table 5</a>).
