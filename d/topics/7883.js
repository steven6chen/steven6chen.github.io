The greatest increase (six- to eightfold) was in adolescents and in adults between the ages of 30 and 50. Between 1999 and 2013, another study noted that <em>emm</em>1, <em>emm</em>3, and <em>emm</em>28 were the most common strains causing invasive GAS infections including bacteremia; an increase in the incidence of group C and group G infections was also observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcal-streptococcus-pyogenes-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Finland between 2008 and 2013, the incidence of invasive bloodborne infections remained stable at 3.6 cases per 100,000 population, but there was a dramatic change in the M type&ndash;specific strains causing infection. The median age of infection was 52 years, and the case-fatality rate was 5.1 percent. There were 72 different <em>emm</em> types (M protein) identified; of these, <em>emm</em>28, <em>emm</em>89, and <em>emm</em>1, were the most common.

Overall, the case-fatality rate for bacteremia was 10.6 percent. Over 100 different <em>emm</em> types were recovered from sterile body sites; the most common <em>emm</em> types were <em>emm</em>1, <em>emm</em>28, and <em>emm</em>89.</p><p/><p>The factors responsible for these observations are not fully understood. It has been suggested that alterations in the distribution of GAS strain M types, together with an increasing prevalence of toxin-producing strains, may be responsible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcal-streptococcus-pyogenes-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/2,3,7,8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,7,8,13</a>]. About half of invasive infections are caused by a limited number of GAS M types (1, 3, 4, 6, and 28); the remaining half are caused by a variety of strains, including nontypeable strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcal-streptococcus-pyogenes-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/1-3,5,7,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,5,7,13,14</a>]. Between 2012 and 2013 in Ireland, there was an increase in prevalence of GAS bacteremia; 48 percent of cases were caused by M-1 strains of GAS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcal-streptococcus-pyogenes-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

All M-1 strains (the most common isolate from patients with bacteremia since 1985) produce NADase, whereas strains of M-1 isolated prior to 1985 (when invasive GAS infections were less prevalent) did not produce the NADase toxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcal-streptococcus-pyogenes-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In the United States between 2005 and 2010, an average of 1168 cases of invasive GAS infection was reported to the Active Bacterial Core Surveillance at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcal-streptococcus-pyogenes-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>]. The incidence is probably much higher, since passive reporting underestimates the disease. The CDC estimates that approximately 12,500 cases of invasive GAS disease and 1250 deaths occurred nationally during 2010. Among individuals &lt;65 years of age, the age-specific incidence of invasive GAS disease is greatest in those &le;1 year (5.2 to 5.8 cases per 100,000 in 2010).</p><p>In France between 2006 and 2007, 664 cases of invasive GAS infection were identified; bacteremia was observed in 70 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcal-streptococcus-pyogenes-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The median age was 55 years and the incidence was 3.1 per 100,000; rates were highest in children &lt;5 years (5.7 per 100,000) and adults &ge;70 (8.4 per 100,000). Skin and soft tissue infections accounted for 30 percent of cases; toxic shock was observed in 20 percent of cases. In-hospital mortality was 43 percent among patients presenting with toxic shock (14 percent overall). Factors independently associated with mortality on multivariate analysis included age &ge;50, preexisting hepatic disease, toxic shock syndrome, bacteremia without an identified focus, and infection caused by an M-1 strain.</p><p>Clusters of severe GAS infection have been observed in long-term care facilities. In 2008, a cluster of 11 severe GAS infections was reported in a long-term acute care hospital in New Mexico [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcal-streptococcus-pyogenes-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Streptococcal bacteremia is most common in the very young and in older adults, although infection may occur in patients of any age, and most patients are not immunosuppressed. Risk factors in adults under 40 include postpartum infection, intravenous drug use, and HIV infection. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common source of GAS bacteremia in adults is skin and soft tissue infection, including cellulitis, erysipelas, pyoderma, injection drug use, burns, varicella virus infection, necrotizing fasciitis, and spontaneous gangrenous myositis. Deep soft tissue infections may also be associated with shock and organ failure. (See <a href=\"#H6615417\" class=\"local\">'Skin and soft tissue infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of GAS bacteremia requires a multidisciplinary approach including antibiotic management, surgical debridement (if warranted), and management of septic physiology (if present). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G</a> (4 million units intravenously every four hours in patients with normal renal function) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> (900 mg intravenously every eight hours) for treatment of GAS bacteremia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>).
