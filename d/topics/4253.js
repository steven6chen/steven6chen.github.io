Implants are composed of four basic parts: a microphone (that detects sound), a speech processor (that selects and arranges sounds), a transmitter (that receives signals from the processor and converts them into electrical impulses), and surgically implanted electrodes (that conduct electrical impulses to the brain) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70810\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70810 \">figure 1</a>). Transmission between the external and internal components takes place via radiofrequency via a magnetic link across the skin.</p><p>Infection is an important complication of cochlear implants, and the type varies with age. Surgical wound infections are more common in adults, whereas meningitis and the complications of acute otitis media in patients with implants (such as mastoiditis and meningitis) are more common in children.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical presentation, microbiology, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of cochlear implant infections will be reviewed here. General information about cochlear implants is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hearing-loss-in-children-treatment#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hearing loss in children: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Cochlear implants'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hearing-amplification-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hearing amplification in adults&quot;, section on 'Cochlear implants'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of prosthetic implant infections involves a complex interaction between the host, the device, and microbes causing the infection. In animal models, the presence of a subcutaneous foreign body reduces the minimal inoculum of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> required to cause infection by a factor of more than 100,000 to as little as 100 colony-forming units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. At least two factors contribute to this increase in risk: foreign bodies do not have a microcirculation, which is crucial for both host defense and the delivery of antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and the interaction between neutrophils and the foreign body can induce a neutrophil defect that may enhance susceptibility to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>If bacteria gain access to a cochlear implant, they become adherent to the device and then multiply and elaborate exopolysaccharides, also known as glycocalyx. Eventually, microcolonies of bacteria encased in glycocalyx coalesce to form a structure known as a biofilm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>The species of bacteria causing implant infections often reflect the endogenous flora of the anatomic site of implantation. The majority of cochlear implant wound infections are caused by skin flora such as <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, which have a propensity to form biofilms. Biofilms containing microcolonies of bacteria encased in a glycocalyx are actually complex bacterial communities with intraspecies communication and adaptation through a process called quorum-sensing, which regulates both virulence and biofilm formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Bacteria near the surface of the biofilm are usually metabolically active with access to nutrients that diffuse through the upper surface of the biofilm. In comparison, organisms deep within the biofilm are metabolically inactive or in various stages of dormancy and are protected from host defenses such as phagocytes and antimicrobial penetration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prosthetic joint infection: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Biofilm'</a>.)</p><p>Cochlear implants are also prone to infections with upper respiratory tract pathogens such as <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and, less often, <em>Haemophilus influenzae </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. These pathogens are typically implicated in otitis media and meningitis in cochlear implant recipients. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> below.)</p><p>Otitis media is of particular concern since it can lead to bacterial meningitis via spread of bacteria from the middle ear to the inner ear along the pathway of the cochlear implant electrode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported incidence of infectious complications following placement of cochlear implants is 1.7 to 4.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. The most common complications of implant surgery in the early postoperative period include surgical wound problems, such as skin flap necrosis, abscess formation, wound dehiscence, and device extrusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. A history of chronic ear infection has been associated with a higher rate of postoperative infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>There is a high rate of implant infections in patients who develop postauricular incisional wound problems. Surgical wound complications are reportedly more common in adult implant recipients, whereas other infectious complications (eg, meningitis and those resulting from acute otitis media) are more common in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The rate of wound complications has declined as surgeons have gained more experience with cochlear implants and as smaller and better skin flaps have been designed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3509327\"><span class=\"h2\">Otitis media</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, acute otitis media can lead to bacterial meningitis in patients with cochlear implants. This is of particular concern in young children, in whom otitis media is most common; children younger than three years of age are receiving cochlear implants with increased frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In a prospective study that evaluated 60 otitis media-prone children who received cochlear implants, ventilation tube placement with or without adenoidectomy preoperatively was performed prior to placement of a cochlear implant. All were required to have normal tympanic membranes and no drainage from the ventilation tube for at least two weeks before cochlear surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Despite these interventions, 44 percent of otitis media-prone children had at least one episode of acute otitis media following their cochlear implant compared with 8 percent of non-otitis media-prone children during the mean follow-up period of 20 months. Five of 14 (36 percent) cases of otitis media occurred within the first month following implantation.</p><p>Cases of mastoiditis have also been reported as a complication of otitis media in cochlear implant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of meningitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intracranial extension of infection can occur with cochlear implants, resulting in an increased risk of bacterial meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/6,7,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,16-18</a>]. The time of onset has varied from less than 24 hours to several years after implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The time between implantation and bacterial meningitis is variable, but the risk is highest during the first two months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. In a review of 24 definite and 5 probable episodes of bacterial meningitis among 26 children with cochlear implants performed in the United States, 9 cases of meningitis were perioperative, occurring within 30 days after surgery, and 20 occurred between 1.5 months and 2 years after surgery (with one exception that occurred at 3 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Among these 20 episodes, 8 (40 percent) occurred in patients with evidence of acute otitis media at presentation. Meningitis occurring as late as 40 months after implantation has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>A number of risk factors for the development of meningitis have been identified in cochlear implant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General risk factors include age less than five years, impaired immune status, presence of other neurologic prostheses such as ventricular shunts, a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, and a past history of meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Otologic risk factors include otitis media postimplantation and a preexisting cochlear malformation (with or without a CSF fistula) such as a Mondini defect or malformed cochlea, which predisposes to meningitis even in the absence of an implant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery-related risk factors include latent bacterial colonization as a result of local surgical trauma, inadequate packing of the cochleostomy (allowing bacteria to spread from the middle ear into the cochlea in the case of otitis media), and use of a positioner.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of positioner</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2002, several cases of bacterial meningitis were reported in cochlear implant recipients in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These infections were thought to be related to a positioner inserted next to the implanted electrode in order to provide contact between the electrode and the wall of the cochlea to facilitate transmission of the electrical signal.</p><p>The same association between the use of positioners and the subsequent risk of bacterial meningitis was also observed in the United States and Canada and reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>In the larger United States experience, there were 24 definite and 5 probable episodes of bacterial meningitis in 26 children at 24 months after surgery among a cohort of 4264 children who had received cochlear implants before age 6 years (2.4 cases per 1000 person-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The estimated adjusted odds ratio for infection was 4.5 (95% CI 1.3-17.9) when a positioner was inserted along with a cochlear implant compared with implant models without a positioner. However, the incidence of pneumococcal meningitis in patients with implants without a positioner was still 16 times higher than the rate in the general population for this age group. A second independent risk factor for bacterial meningitis was the combination of a radiographic malformation of the inner ear and cerebrospinal fluid leak.</p><p>A later report from the United States group identified 12 cases of meningitis among patients with cochlear implants, six of which occurred between 25 and 40 months after implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The incidence of meningitis beyond 24 months after implantation among children with positioners was 4.5 per 1000 person-years, compared with no cases in children without positioners.</p><p>These findings led to the voluntary recall of implant devices that included a positioner in July 2002. Possible explanations for the risk associated with a positioner include the larger cochleostomy required for the insertion, the introduction of an additional foreign body in the inner ear, inner ear trauma related to wedging of the positioner into place, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> incomplete connective tissue seal at the cochleostomy site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with infected cochlear implants usually present with one or more of the following features, depending on the type of infection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peri-implant swelling and redness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wound dehiscence with device exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mastoiditis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meningitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute otitis media, sometimes complicated by tympanic membrane rupture <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subperiosteal abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Diagnosis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>Early recognition of bacterial meningitis permits early intervention, which is vital for both successful treatment of bacterial meningitis and for minimizing permanent neurologic injury.

In a report from the United States, 15 of 24 episodes with a known cause were due to <em>S. pneumoniae</em> (11 associated with bacteremia and 1 with pneumonia), and 5 to <em>H. influenzae</em> (two type b) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It should be noted that this study began prior to the availability of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; in the current era, the risk of invasive pneumococcal infection would be expected to be lower. <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> has not been reported so far as a cause of meningitis in cochlear implant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Among nine cases of bacterial meningitis that developed within 30 days of cochlear implant placement, four were caused by <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, two were caused by <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em>, and one case each was caused by <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae </em>type b, and <em>Enterococcus </em>spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p><em>S. aureus</em> is the most common organism isolated from patients with localized wound infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

Samples obtained during debridement or drainage of the implant site, middle ear cavity, and mastoid are crucial for establishing a microbiologic diagnosis. In comparison, samples obtained from the external auditory canal may be misleading due to contamination by normal flora in the external ear canal.</p><p>In selected patients, computed tomography may be required to determine the position of the cochlear electrodes post-implantation and to detect fluid collections associated with the hardware, bony involvement (ie, osteomyelitis), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of a subperiosteal abscess. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not performed in the majority of cases due to metallic artifact and the presence of a magnet within most cochlear implants, which is a contraindication for MRI.

(See <a href=\"#H2891499\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>A head computed tomography (CT) scan may be performed to rule out intracranial infection. Approximately 60 percent of patients require surgical drainage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> debridement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Treatment without implant removal is the preferred option in major infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Removal of the implant results in significant disability due to deafness, and reimplantation after treatment of the infection is often difficult due to scarring resulting from the infection. Indications for surgery include severe mastoiditis or a poor response to antibiotics. Slowly progressive and late-onset infections are more likely to be resistant to medical therapy, possibly due to concurrent osteomyelitis or biofilm formation around the cochlear implant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/22,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,31,32</a>]. Wound infections that result in exposure of the device are unlikely to respond to conservative therapy and usually require removal of the cochlear implant to attain cure. In one study, for example, eight of nine such patients required device explantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>At surgery, all inflammatory granulation tissue should be removed from the mastoid and middle ear, and the area of the cochleostomy tube should be debrided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. This can often be accomplished without changing the position of the implanted array. If purulent secretions exit the scala tympani upon removal of the tissue sealing the cochleostomy, the surgeon must decide whether or not the device needs to be removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. If a decision is made to remove the receiver stimulator due to infection and infection is not found in the middle ear, it is recommended that the electrode be severed at the facial recess, leaving the intracochlear leads in place to guide future electrode placement if the same ear is reimplanted.</p><p>Depending upon the severity of infection and the extent of debridement, patients are usually treated with intravenous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oral antibiotics for one to three months. The results of cultures obtained during debridement should guide the selection of antibiotic therapy.</p><p>A systematic review of published literature addressing the question of whether acute mastoiditis in a child with a cochlear implant requires explantation included 12 studies and 43 children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Acute mastoiditis was defined as otalgia in the presence of postauricular swelling, erythema, and tenderness. Subperiosteal abscess was present in 14.3 percent of all cases. Surgery was performed in one-half of cases and included insertion of pressure equalizing tubes (PETs), mastoidectomy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> incision and drainage of an abscess. Only one patient underwent cochlear implant explantation due to the failure of initial medical and surgical therapies; the patient developed signs suggestive of device malfunction (pain on stimulation). Another study reported benefit of early surgical intervention with PETs with or without incision and drainage for mastoiditis, allowing preservation of the cochlear implant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>When explantation is required, reimplantation can be successfully performed in some patients, although it may be more difficult due to scarring from the infection. In one report, two patients with late-onset chronic pseudomonal cochlear implant infections that were unresponsive to local debridement and antibiotics underwent partial explantation with the electrodes left in place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. After two to three months of antibiotic therapy, reimplantation was carried out successfully with no recurrence of infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Otitis media</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of middle ear infection (otitis media) in cochlear implant recipients are crucial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cochlear-implant-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Infection is an important complication of cochlear implants, and the type varies with age. Surgical wound complications are more common in adult implant recipients, whereas other infectious complications (eg, acute otitis media, mastoiditis, meningitis) are more common in children. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The species of bacteria causing implant infections often reflect the endogenous flora of the anatomic site of implantation. The majority of cochlear implant wound infections are caused by skin flora such as <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. Cochlear implants are also prone to infections with upper respiratory tract pathogens such as <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and, less often, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>. These pathogens are typically implicated in otitis media and meningitis in cochlear implant recipients. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measures to prevent cochlear implant infections include vaccination, preoperative evaluation for anatomic abnormalities, perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, and evaluation for and aggressive management of otitis media. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Principles of prevention'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1379129\" class=\"local\">'Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single intravenous dose of a prophylactic antibiotic that targets gram-positive skin flora (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>) should be administered prior to the surgical incision for cochlear implant placement. The choice of regimen depends upon patient-related factors, including the risk of methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) colonization and cephalosporin allergy, and is discussed in detail above. Prophylactic cefazolin or clindamycin should be administered 60 minutes prior to the surgical incision, whereas vancomycin administration should be started 120 minutes prior to the incision. (See <a href=\"#H1379129\" class=\"local\">'Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minor infections are manifested by erythema and swelling around the implant site without fluctuance, drainage, or intracranial or auditory complications. Patients with minor wound infections should be treated empirically with an oral antibacterial agent with activity against MRSA. Appropriate agents include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>.

Treatment of these infections requires hospitalization, intravenous antibiotics, and possible revision surgery, with or without explantation of the device. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Major infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cochlear implant candidates should ideally receive necessary vaccines at least two weeks prior to surgery.
