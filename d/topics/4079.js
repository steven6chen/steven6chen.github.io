We prefer approaches that incorporate clinical assessment of the pretest probability (PTP) (see <a href=\"#H949823679\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of clinical pretest probability'</a> below) and D-dimer testing in select patients (see <a href=\"#H2328086790\" class=\"local\">'D-dimer'</a> below). This approach allows for the strategic use of ultrasonography for diagnosis (see <a href=\"#H1036971809\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic ultrasonography suspected first DVT'</a> below). Although alternative imaging modalities are available (eg, computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] venography), they are rarely, if ever, needed and are therefore not generally included in the strategies described in this topic. (See <a href=\"#H1036977316\" class=\"local\">'Alternative imaging'</a> below.)</p><p>The goal of diagnostic testing is to &quot;rule-in&quot; (&gt;85 percent post-test probability of DVT) or &quot;rule out&quot; DVT (&lt;2 percent post-test probability of venous thromboembolism [VTE] in the next three months) with an acceptable level of certainty, thereby justifying instituting or withholding therapy, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-deep-vein-thrombosis-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H949823679\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of clinical pretest probability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with suspected first DVT, we suggest estimation of the clinical PTP.

Choosing how to assess PTP is often dependent upon clinician preference as neither gestalt estimates nor prediction rules have been conclusively proven to be superior to the other.

Alternatively, proximal ultrasonography may be done in most and whole leg ultrasonography in select subgroups (eg, those with prominent calf symptoms and negative proximal ultrasonography). Although all approaches are acceptable, in practice the choice between proximal or whole leg ultrasonography is often institution-specific. Thus, it is important that clinicians know which test is performed at their institution and be familiar with its advantages and disadvantages.

Whole leg ultrasonography will also detect isolated distal DVT; isolated distal DVT sometimes resolves or does not extend proximally without treatment and is associated with less severe complications (see <a href=\"#H25495370\" class=\"local\">'Whole leg'</a> below). Thus, routine use of whole leg ultrasonography has the potential to lead to the diagnosis of DVT that does not necessarily need to be treated.

The identification of proximal DVT is clinically significant since it is more likely to progress and embolize compared with isolated distal DVT. Proximal vein CUS has a high sensitivity for the diagnosis of proximal vein DVT (&gt;95 percent) and a high negative predictive value for ruling out proximal DVT in all patients, and for ruling out all DVT (including isolated distal DVT) in those with a low clinical pretest probability (PTP) for DVT (see <a href=\"#H949823679\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of clinical pretest probability'</a> above).

In bacterial cellulitis, the warmth and redness often skip areas and may be associated with constitutional symptoms including fever. Some patients with venous insufficiency develop a low-grade, nonbacterial cellulitis, which resembles infectious cellulitis, but without constitutional symptoms. Although fever increases the suspicion for cellulitis, it can also be present in DVT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellulitis-and-skin-abscess-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellulitis and skin abscess: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Superficial thrombophlebitis</strong> &ndash; Superficial vein thrombophlebitis classically presents with palpable, tender superficial veins. However, since superficial thrombophlebitis is a risk factor for DVT, many of these individuals also undergo ultrasound to rule out DVT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Phlebitis and thrombosis of the superficial lower extremity veins&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Venous valvular insufficiency</strong> &ndash; Venous insufficiency is a common cause of chronic unilateral leg edema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56758\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56758 \">picture 1</a>) and may be associated with varicose veins.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of peripheral lymphedema&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Popliteal (Baker's) cyst</strong> &ndash; The majority of popliteal cysts are due to either distention of a bursa by fluid originating from a knee joint or posterior herniation of the joint capsule due to increased intra-articular pressure. A popliteal cyst that causes calf symptoms is usually leaking or has ruptured. It is often distinguished from DVT by posterior knee pain, knee stiffness, swelling or a mass behind the knee (especially with the knee in extension), and by bruising around the ankle. However, calf symptoms are common; in addition, compression of the popliteal vein may cause leg swelling or secondary DVT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=popliteal-bakers-cyst\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Popliteal (Baker's) cyst&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inflammatory pathology of the knee </strong>&ndash; Pain, inflammation, and swelling can accompany any knee joint pathology, which can be confused with a popliteal cyst or DVT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unspecified knee pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Drug-induced edema or heart failure</strong> &ndash; Leg swelling is a side effect of some drugs, such as calcium channel blockers, and is commonly found in patients with congestive heart failure. The edema is usually bilateral, but can be asymmetric if there is underlying venous pathology; signs of inflammation are not generally present.

Having a high degree of certainty that DVT is &quot;ruled-in&quot; (&gt;85 percent post-test probability of DVT) or &quot;ruled out&quot; (&lt;2 percent post-test probability of progressive VTE in the next three months) is critical so that administering or withholding therapy can be justified. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DVT of the lower extremity should be suspected in patients who have clinical manifestations with or without risk factors for thrombus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F59759\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59759 \">table 1</a>). In general, clinical and laboratory findings have poor sensitivity and specificity diagnostically but may be important when considering alternative diagnoses, or determine how a confirmed DVT will be treated. (See <a href=\"#H10762932\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom a first DVT is suspected, we suggest a diagnostic approach that incorporates clinical assessment with estimation of pretest probability (PTP) by gestalt <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the Wells score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-dvt-probability-in-adults-wells-score-system\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-modified-wells-score-for-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75871\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75871 \">table 2</a>), D-dimer measurement and, when necessary, compression ultrasonography (CUS) with Doppler of the lower extremities. (see <a href=\"#H2379347431\" class=\"local\">'Suspected first DVT (risk stratification)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H949823679\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of clinical pretest probability'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2328086790\" class=\"local\">'D-dimer'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with a <strong>low</strong> PTP for DVT, we suggest that a high or moderate sensitivity D-dimer level be performed. Patients in whom the D-dimer level is normal (eg, &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> do <strong>not</strong> need further testing, while those in whom the D-dimer is positive (eg, &ge;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> should have ultrasonography of the lower extremities. Patients can proceed directly to ultrasonography if the D-dimer is expected to be positive due to another condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60881\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60881 \">table 3</a>). DVT is diagnosed if ultrasonography is positive; no further testing is required if ultrasonography is negative. (See <a href=\"#H1036971744\" class=\"local\">'Low-probability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with <strong>moderate</strong> PTP for DVT, we suggest that a high-sensitivity D-dimer level be performed. Patients in whom the D-dimer level is normal do <strong>not</strong> need further testing, while those in whom the D-dimer is positive should have ultrasonography of the lower extremities. Patients can proceed directly to ultrasonography if the D-dimer is expected to be positive due to another condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60881\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60881 \">table 3</a>). DVT is diagnosed if ultrasonography is positive. When neither proximal nor distal DVT is identified on whole leg ultrasonography, no further testing is required; in contrast, in those in whom proximal ultrasonography is negative, repeat proximal ultrasonography should be performed at one week to detect extension of distal DVT into the proximal veins. (See <a href=\"#H1036971758\" class=\"local\">'Moderate-probability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a <strong>high </strong>PTP for DVT, we suggest that ultrasonography be performed. DVT is diagnosed if ultrasonography is positive. If DVT is not identified, options include high sensitivity D-dimer level measurement (if not expected to be positive due to another condition), repeat proximal CUS at one week (off anticoagulation), whole leg ultrasonography (if not already performed), or iliac vein ultrasonography (when iliac vein DVT is suspected). Choosing among these options should be individualized. In general, if one or more of these tests are negative in a patient without proximal DVT on ultrasound, then no further testing is required. (See <a href=\"#H1036971765\" class=\"local\">'High-probability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most patients with suspected DVT, CUS with Doppler is the imaging test of choice. The presence of DVT is diagnosed by demonstrating non-compressibility of the imaged vein. Both proximal and whole leg ultrasonography have a high sensitivity for the detection of thrombus in the proximal veins (ie, common femoral, femoral and popliteal veins). Whole leg ultrasonography additionally examines the veins in the calf (peroneal, posterior and anterior tibial, and muscular veins) and can therefore detect isolated distal DVT. Choosing proximal or whole leg ultrasonography varies among experts and is often institution-specific. Thus, it is important that clinicians know which test is performed at their institution and be familiar with the advantages and disadvantages of each test. (See <a href=\"#H1036971809\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic ultrasonography suspected first DVT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with suspected <strong>ipsilateral</strong> DVT recurrence, proceeding directly to ultrasonography (proximal or whole leg ultrasonography) OR using an approach similar to that described for first suspected DVT is appropriate. When an ultrasonographic abnormality is identified in patients with suspected recurrence, it may be difficult for the clinician to determine whether it is due to old or new thrombus. Availability of a previous ultrasound or ultrasound report that documents the extent of residual thrombosis greatly improves the accuracy of ultrasound for recurrent DVT. (See <a href=\"#H2147537635\" class=\"local\">'Suspected recurrent DVT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with suspected DVT, contrast-enhanced computed tomographic venography (CTV) and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) are rarely used diagnostically, unless there is uncertainty about iliac vein or inferior vena cava thrombosis after ultrasonography. While widely used in the past, ascending contrast venography, which was the gold standard for DVT diagnosis, and impedance plethysmography are now rarely used or available. (See <a href=\"#H1036977316\" class=\"local\">'Alternative imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis in patients with suspected DVT includes muscle <span class=\"nowrap\">strain/tear</span> lymphedema, venous insufficiency, popliteal (Baker's) cyst, and cellulitis. There are no pathognomic clinical features that reliably distinguish DVT from competing diagnoses since redness, swelling, tenderness and pain are common to many of these disorders.
