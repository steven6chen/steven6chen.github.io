Historically, GBS was considered a single disorder, but it is now known to be a heterogeneous syndrome with several variant forms. Most often, GBS presents as an acute monophasic paralyzing illness provoked by a preceding infection. In addition to the demyelinating form, which is the most common type, axonal forms of GBS are well-recognized.</p><p>This topic will review the epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of GBS in children. Other aspects of GBS are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome: Pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One proposed mechanism for GBS is that an antecedent infection evokes an immune response, which in turn cross-reacts with peripheral nerve components because of the sharing of cross-reactive epitopes (molecular mimicry). The end result is an acute polyneuropathy. This immune response can be directed towards the myelin or the axon of peripheral nerve. The main lesions of GBS are acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy and, particularly in patients with Campylobacter-associated disease, acute axonal degeneration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome: Pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Molecular mimicry'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis#H603782914\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome: Pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Pathology'</a>.)</p><p>Antecedent infections are common with GBS, and are thought to trigger the immune response that leads to acute polyneuropathy. Approximately two-thirds of patients give a history of an antecedent respiratory tract or gastrointestinal infection. Campylobacter infection is the most commonly identified precipitant of GBS and can be demonstrated in as many as 30 percent of cases. Other precipitants include cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and influenza-like illnesses. GBS can also occur in association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, predominantly in those who are not profoundly immunocompromised. A small percentage of patients develop GBS after another triggering event such as immunization, surgery, trauma, or bone-marrow transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome: Pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Antecedent events'</a>.)</p><p>While GBS has followed vaccinations, the small risk of GBS associated with influenza vaccination, of approximately one to two excess cases of GBS per million people vaccinated, is substantially less than the overall health risk posed by naturally occurring influenza. Furthermore, the risk of GBS following influenza infection is several times greater than the risk following influenza vaccination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome: Pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Vaccination'</a>.)</p><p>The available evidence suggests that there is no increased risk of GBS associated with the H1N1 influenza vaccine in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the post-polio era, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (GBS) is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis in healthy infants and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

While all age groups are affected, the incidence is lower in children than in adults. The incidence increases by approximately 20 percent with every 10-year increase in age beyond the first decade of life. GBS occurs rarely in children younger than two years of age, but can occur even in infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

In patients with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy (AIDP), the most common form of GBS, two-thirds develop the neurologic symptoms two to four weeks after what initially appears to be a benign febrile respiratory or gastrointestinal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>The classic presentation of GBS begins with paresthesia in the toes and fingertips followed by lower extremity symmetric or modestly asymmetric weakness that may ascend over hours to days to involve the arms and, in severe cases, the muscles of respiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy (AIDP) is the most common type. Axonal forms of GBS are also well-recognized. Each type of GBS has distinguishing clinical, pathophysiologic and pathologic features. The classic presentation of ascending paralysis is most common, but a number of atypical variants present with local or regional involvement of particular muscle groups or nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,28,29</a>].

This disorder is distinguished from AIDP by its involvement of predominantly motor nerves and an electrophysiologic pattern suggesting axonal damage. AMAN occurs mainly in northern China, but is also a common form of GBS in other locations, including Japan, Mexico, and South America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-36</a>]. It is more common in developing nations, has a seasonal incidence, and is associated with a preceding Campylobacter jejuni infection. In a series of 31 Japanese children with GBS classified by electrophysiologic criteria, AIDP, AMAN, and unclassified GBS were seen in 11, 15, and 5 children (35, 48, and 16 percent), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The presenting clinical features and recovery are similar to those of AIDP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

In some cases, this results in unrecordable motor responses. It may not be possible, on neurophysiologic criteria, to distinguish this situation from extensive axonal degeneration. The prognostic implications of severely reduced CMAP amplitudes must therefore be interpreted with caution. When peripheral responses are unrecordable, a search for more proximal responses (such as those from stimulation of the phrenic or axillary nerves) may enable identification of a primarily demyelinating process. Electromyographic evidence of acute denervation is always suggestive of severe axonal injury and a worse prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3392820\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal MRI with administration of gadolinium frequently shows enhancement of the spinal nerve roots and cauda equina during the first weeks after the onset of GBS in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>].

The end result is an acute polyneuropathy. This immune response can be directed towards the myelin or the axon of peripheral nerve. Campylobacter infection is the most commonly identified precipitant of GBS.

The most common symptoms at presentation in children are pain and gait difficulty. Lower extremity symmetric or modestly asymmetric weakness may ascend over hours to days to involve the arms and the muscles of respiration in severe cases. The facial nerve is occasionally affected, resulting in bifacial weakness. Autonomic dysfunction occurs in approximately one-half of children. Physical examination typically reveals lower-extremity predominant, essentially symmetric weakness with diminished or absent reflexes. Most patients reach their clinical nadir within two to four weeks, with subsequent return of function over the course of weeks to months.
