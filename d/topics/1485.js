In one study of 32,561 young athletes who underwent ECG screening, only six patients had an atrial tachyarrhythmia, four with ectopic atrial tachycardia and two with AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-with-arrhythmias-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Supraventricular arrhythmias are not thought to be more common in the athlete or caused by sports activity, with the possible exception of AF. Some epidemiologic data demonstrate a higher than expected prevalence of AF in athletes at the extreme of <span class=\"nowrap\">training/exercise</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-with-arrhythmias-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>Ventricular arrhythmia (ie, &gt;1 ventricular premature beat [VPB] in the standard ECG) is uncommon in athletes, and not different from the general population, being present in &lt;1 percent of athletes screened with ECGs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-with-arrhythmias-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. If more frequent VPBs are recorded on a standard (10-second) ECG, it is likely that the athlete has a high 24-hour VPB burden. While multiple VPBs are most likely benign in a highly trained athlete, their presence may be the hallmark of underlying heart disease and require careful evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-with-arrhythmias-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1878743431\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When present, symptoms should be evaluated to determine whether any action needs to be taken. Arrhythmic symptoms may be related to the arrhythmia itself (eg, palpitations) or due to the hemodynamic consequences of the arrhythmias (eg, dyspnea, dizziness). Patients with an arrhythmia can present with a variety of symptoms, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpitations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syncope or presyncope</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lightheadedness or dizziness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained, transient impairment in physical performance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)</p><p/><p>Patients with a <strong>tachyarrhythmia</strong> most commonly present with palpitations, the sensation of a rapid or irregular heart beat felt in the anterior chest or neck. Usually the symptoms are abrupt in onset, although this may vary depending on the specific arrhythmia. Palpitations may be associated with diaphoresis, lightheadedness, or dizziness. Patients with a tachyarrhythmia may also report shortness of breath or chest discomfort, with syncope and SCA as less common presentations.</p><p>Patients with a <strong>bradyarrhythmia</strong> most commonly present with fatigue <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exertional dyspnea, although patients may present with lightheadedness, dizziness, or syncope if the heart rate is significantly slower or if there is a prolonged pause or period of asystole. Patients with a bradyarrhythmia may also report palpitations (ie, the feeling of irregular heart beating), though less commonly than in patients with a tachyarrhythmia. Chest pain is rare in patients with a bradyarrhythmia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2625575292\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Athletes frequently have asymptomatic benign sinus bradycardia, due to high vagal tone. Although unusual, athletes may remain asymptomatic with a tachyarrhythmia typically when the resulting ventricular rate is in the normal range and is adequate to maintain the required cardiac output. In such cases, the arrhythmia is identified incidentally when the athlete is seeking medical attention for another reason or when the athlete undergoes preparticipation screening. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-to-prevent-sudden-cardiac-death-in-athletes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening to prevent sudden cardiac death in athletes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351460089\"><span class=\"h2\">Palpitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Palpitations are a sensory symptom defined as an unpleasant awareness of the forceful, rapid, or irregular beating of the heart. Patients may at times describe the sensation as a rapid fluttering in the chest, flip-flopping in the chest, or a pounding sensation in the chest or neck, and these descriptions may help elucidate the cause of the palpitations. When associated with an arrhythmia, palpitations are more commonly seen with a tachyarrhythmia rather than a bradyarrhythmia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-palpitations-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of palpitations in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H166374169\"><span class=\"h2\">Syncope and presyncope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Syncope (and presyncope, with lightheadedness or dizziness) in an athlete is an important symptom that requires a thorough evaluation. Syncope that occurs during exertion suggests a potentially life-threatening arrhythmic etiology (eg, aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ventricular arrhythmia, etc) and should be evaluated very seriously and urgently. On the other hand, syncope in the recovery phase after exertion (eg, during cooling off period) is generally not arrhythmic and is more likely due to a vagal reflex.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A common cause of syncope and presyncope in young athletes is neurally-mediated (vasovagal) syncope, which is generally unassociated with cardiac disease and conveys a benign clinical outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-with-arrhythmias-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. This type of syncope is due to neurally-mediated mechanisms; however, hypovolemia from unreplaced fluid losses may contribute in athletes. Athletes (especially those engaged in endurance disciplines) may be more susceptible to neurally-mediated syncope by nature of their increased vagal tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-with-arrhythmias-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiologies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and etiologies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Underlying structural heart disease and other causes should be eliminated before confirming reflex (neurally-mediated) syncope as the etiology. Among the pathologic cardiac causes of exertional syncope are ventricular tachycardia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> obstruction resulting from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or aortic stenosis, and hypotension due to vagally-mediated vasodepression in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Exercise-associated syncope may also be related to hyponatremia or hyperthermia as a result of intense or prolonged exercise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H274573\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Syncope'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The prevalence and nature of syncope in athletes was evaluated in a report on 7568 young athletes (mean age 16 years), 474 of whom (6.2 percent) reported a syncopal spell in the preceding five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-with-arrhythmias-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Syncope was unrelated to exercise in 411 (87 percent), postexertional in 57 (12 percent), and exertional in six (1 percent). All episodes of nonexertional or postexertional syncope were diagnosed as vasovagal (neurally-mediated syncope), situational, or postexertional postural hypotension based upon the clinical history. In the six patients with exertional syncope, further testing identified one case of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, one case of right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia, and four cases of neurocardiogenic syncope. At six years of follow-up, the rate of syncope recurrence was 2 per 100 patient-years. There were no other adverse cardiovascular events in follow-up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1108159757\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest discomfort and/or shortness of breath</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chest discomfort <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shortness of breath are not infrequent symptoms in patients with either a tachyarrhythmia or a bradyarrhythmia. Chest discomfort (not all patients will describe &quot;pain&quot; but instead a sensation that is different than normal) is more commonly seen in patients with a tachyarrhythmia, often in association with palpitations. Shortness of breath may result from either a tachyarrhythmia, likely resulting in increased pulmonary vascular pressures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> congestion, or from a bradyarrhythmia, usually due to inadequate cardiac output to meet the body&rsquo;s oxygen demands during exercise.

Malignant arrhythmias, usually ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF), are responsible for SCA in athletes. Frequently, such arrhythmias occur in the setting of underlying structural cardiac disease (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, etc), although previously undiagnosed primary electrical disease (eg, Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome, etc) may also be the cause of <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span>. Preparticipation screening of athletes is largely directed at identifying underlying cardiac conditions, which would increase the risk of SCA for athletes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-to-prevent-sudden-cardiac-death-in-athletes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening to prevent sudden cardiac death in athletes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3998593790\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation of the athlete with an arrhythmia consists of a complete history (aimed at defining the type of symptoms, the timing of the arrhythmia, and potential underlying diseases), physical examination (with an emphasis on assessing hemodynamic stability if the patient is actively experiencing an arrhythmia), and 12-lead ECG. If possible, the ECG is obtained both during sinus rhythm and with symptoms. For patients in whom the initial ECG is normal or unrevealing, additional ambulatory ECG, particularly prolonged (two to four weeks) monitoring, is useful to confirm the diagnosis. The diagnosis is usually not made until there is an ECG obtained during the arrhythmia, as the correlation can be made between the type of arrhythmia and a particular symptom(s) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-with-arrhythmias-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Following the initial evaluation (and stabilization of the patient, if necessary), additional cardiac testing is warranted to assess for underlying structural heart disease which may influence subsequent diagnostic and therapeutic decision making. (See <a href=\"#H2251221153\" class=\"local\">'Additional testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2978473017\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing the patient for hemodynamic stability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important clinical determination when an arrhythmia is noted is whether the patient is experiencing signs and symptoms related to the arrhythmia. The appropriate evaluation and treatment will depend upon whether the patient is actively experiencing a tachyarrhythmia or bradyarrhythmia. The approach to assessing hemodynamic stability of both tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias is discussed in detail separately.

However, a definitive diagnosis is not always possible, particularly when an ECG during symptoms is not available for review. Whenever possible, a previous ECG when the patient was in normal sinus rhythm may be helpful for comparison and for identifying potential underlying pathology (eg, preexisting conduction delays, accessory pathways with a delta wave, Q waves suggesting a prior myocardial infarction, etc).

The primary focus of any additional testing is to document the presence (or absence) of underlying structural heart disease. In some cases, additional testing may be performed with the intent of identifying the arrhythmia with prolonged ambulatory monitoring or with testing to provoke the arrhythmia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1115488269\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiac imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All athletes with a known arrhythmia, or those with a high suspicion for an arrhythmia, should have a transthoracic echocardiogram performed. Echocardiography is readily available and, in most patients, provides adequate visualization of the heart. However, if echocardiographic imaging is deemed to be nondiagnostic, additional imaging with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) should be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2944337968\"><span class=\"h3\">Stress testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For athletes with symptoms suggestive of an arrhythmia during exertion, exercise stress testing is warranted. Exercise testing in patients with symptoms of arrhythmic origin is intended to assess the athlete's hemodynamic behavior during exercise (ie, the heart rate and blood pressure response to exercise) and the reproducibility of symptoms, as well as the potential recording of the arrhythmia. Cardiac monitoring during the test will allow the determination of whether the symptoms, if reproduced, are due to an arrhythmia. Moreover, the exercise test may be part of the diagnostic evaluation for underlying cardiac disease (ie, coronary heart disease, hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy, channelopathies, etc).</p><p>Ideally, the stress test optimally should mimic the exertion, which brings on the symptoms. While a standard Bruce protocol may be acceptable for some athletes, this protocol (and other standard protocols used in the diagnosis of obstructive coronary heart disease) is often not optimal for competitive athletes with symptoms. For example, if the athlete has symptoms only with sprints, then sprints should be performed during the treadmill test. Alternatively, both symptomatic endurance athletes and lab personnel should be forewarned that a long duration test might be necessary to reproduce the type of endurance exercise in which symptoms have occurred. Arrhythmias may not always be reproducible in the exercise lab, and the ECG monitoring is relevant to the identification of the nature of arrhythmic event.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3477852580\"><span class=\"h3\">Ambulatory ECG monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For athletes in whom an arrhythmia is highly suspected based upon the presenting signs and symptoms, but whose initial ECG is unrevealing, we perform ambulatory ECG monitoring. Ambulatory ECG, especially the long-term (two to four weeks) recording, significantly increases the likelihood of capturing abnormal heart rhythms and confirming the diagnosis. Ambulatory ECG monitoring is generally performed during normal routine activity as well as during exercise. The choice of a particular monitoring device and duration of monitoring depends primarily on the frequency and duration of symptoms. The approach to choosing an ambulatory ECG monitor is discussed in detail separately. For athletes with daily symptoms, a 24-hour monitor may be sufficient. However, most will need longer monitors. Continuous monitoring is possible with devices that attach to the skin with electrodes. Some of these store the entire ECG while others only store abnormally slow or fast arrhythmias or when the patient triggers a recording. Some will instantly alert the health care provider with abnormal results while others do not have this wireless capability. The ability to obtain a single-lead, real-time ECG by portable devices is rapidly expanding. These devices typically collect a lead I (right arm to left arm) ECG, which can be of very high quality. Some of these devices are linked to a cell phone while others stand alone. They are very valuable for individuals whose symptoms persist long enough to activate the device (typically around 30 seconds), while they are not valuable for those with very short episodes or to evaluate syncope and presyncope. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-ecg-monitoring#H605778078\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory ECG monitoring&quot;, section on 'Our approach to choosing an ambulatory ECG monitoring strategy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3707885714\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrophysiology studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Invasive electrophysiologic studies (EPS) are not generally indicated in the work up of the athlete&rsquo;s arrhythmias, which is mostly based on either ECG or ambulatory monitoring. If a tachyarrhythmia has been diagnosed by an ECG, then an EPS and ablation may be indicated, with an aim to cure the arrhythmia. EPS is rarely indicated in the absence of an ECG diagnosis of tachyarrhythmia with the exception being those individuals with concerning <span class=\"nowrap\">syncope/presyncope</span> or palpitations and a surface ECG documenting pre-excitation (Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW] syndrome). In these individuals, an EPS is useful to stratify the risk of sudden cardiac death and potentially cure the patient.

Rarely are arrhythmias fatal; however, sudden cardiac death resulting from a malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmia is a devastating event in young and apparently healthy persons. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an arrhythmia can present with a variety of symptoms, including palpitations, <span class=\"nowrap\">syncope/presyncope,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">lightheadedness/dizziness,</span> chest pain, shortness of breath, and rarely sudden cardiac arrest. Arrhythmic symptoms may be related to the arrhythmia itself (eg, palpitations) or due to the hemodynamic consequences of the arrhythmias (eg, dyspnea, dizziness). Patients with a <strong>tachyarrhythmia</strong> most commonly present with palpitations. Patients with a <strong>bradyarrhythmia</strong> most commonly present with fatigue <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exertional dyspnea, although patients may present with lightheadedness, dizziness, or syncope. (See <a href=\"#H1878743431\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation of the athlete with an arrhythmia consists of a complete history, physical examination, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). If possible, the ECG is obtained both during sinus rhythm and the symptoms, and a previous ECG when the patient was in normal sinus rhythm may be helpful for comparison and for identifying potential underlying pathology. (See <a href=\"#H3122556545\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of the ECG'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For athletes with a confirmed arrhythmia diagnosis (based on ECG results), as well as for those in whom an arrhythmia is highly suspected based upon the presenting signs and symptoms but without ECG documentation, additional cardiac testing is typically performed, including cardiac imaging in all patients, stress testing and ambulatory ECG monitoring, and selected additional testing on a case-by-case basis. (See <a href=\"#H2251221153\" class=\"local\">'Additional testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The arrhythmic diagnosis is often confirmed using the ECG obtained during the arrhythmia, as the correlation can be made between the type of arrhythmia and particular symptom(s), but may require additional ECG monitoring if the initial ECG is unrevealing.
