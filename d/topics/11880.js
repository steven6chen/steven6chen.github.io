More than 17 million Americans use various NSAIDs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70067\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70067 \">table 1</a>) on a daily basis, making this class of drugs one of the most commonly used in the world.</p><p>The side effects that can occur following the use of nonselective NSAIDs (nsNSAIDs) that block both cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 will be reviewed here.

All of the available nonselective (ns)NSAIDs generally inhibit both isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX), COX-1 and COX-2, with the exception of the nonacetylated salicylates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Pharmacology and mechanism of action&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-mechanism-of-action-major-toxicities-and-use-in-rheumatic-diseases#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin: Mechanism of action, major toxicities, and use in rheumatic diseases&quot;, section on 'Other proposed mechanisms of action'</a>.)</p><p>A number of factors can increase the risk of adverse effects due to NSAIDs. These include drug dose, drug-drug interactions, and comorbidities. The latter two factors are more common in older adults, and approximately 14 million Americans 45 and over use various non-aspirin NSAIDs regularly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States predicts that, with the aging of the population, there will be a significant increase in the prevalence of painful degenerative and inflammatory rheumatic conditions. This will probably lead to a parallel increase in the use of NSAIDs. An increased use of NSAIDs in an aging population will increase the number of adverse events related to NSAID use. It has been estimated that 5 to 7 percent of hospital admissions are related to adverse effects of drugs, and, of these hospitalizations, those that result from gastrointestinal, nervous system, renal, or allergic effects of non-aspirin NSAIDs are responsible for approximately 11 to 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Given their common mechanisms of action and the effects of the other factors that increase risk of adverse effects, it is difficult to name a &quot;safest&quot; nsNSAID. As an example, many clinicians believe that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> is quite safe, which is true when the drug is used at the lowest possible dose. However, increasing the dose of any NSAID is associated with an increased risk of most related toxicities.</p><p>Drug interactions may also be the source of adverse effects. For example, a potentially clinically relevant interaction between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> referred to as &quot;aspirin resistance&quot; has been observed in ex vivo platelet assays when ibuprofen is administered to healthy controls before aspirin. Similar effects, which also depend upon timing of drug administration, have been demonstrated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> and may occur with other NSAIDs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects#H6069749\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;, section on 'Patients taking aspirin for prevention'</a>.)</p><p>Minimizing toxicity of NSAIDs also depends upon a thorough patient evaluation for those characteristics or comorbidities that enhance their risk of developing NSAID-induced toxicity. As an example, risk factors have been identified for the development of gastroduodenal toxicity, acute renal failure, and adverse cardiovascular effects, such as a history of a gastrointestinal event, reduced renal function, or a history of cardiovascular disease, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal effects'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18852068\" class=\"local\">'Renal effects'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular effects'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE NSAID OVERDOSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accidental or intentional ingestion of a single larger-than-recommended dose of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) is typically well tolerated and usually does not cause serious adverse effects. However, such ingestions may be accompanied by the taking of other analgesics, which may have more serious consequences. Among these drugs, salicylates and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> are important ones to consider. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salicylate-aspirin-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salicylate (aspirin) poisoning in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-adults-pathophysiology-presentation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acetaminophen (paracetamol) poisoning in adults: Pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-adults-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acetaminophen (paracetamol) poisoning in adults: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms of acute overdose of NSAIDs are nonspecific, and patients are most often asymptomatic; when symptoms do occur, the most common include nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, blurred vision, and dizziness.</p><p>The clinical and laboratory features, evaluation, and management of an acute NSAID overdose are presented in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drug-nsaid-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">GASTROINTESTINAL EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsNSAIDs) have potentially important gastrointestinal adverse effects, which include dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, and bleeding.

Chronic, as opposed to short-term, use; untreated <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> infection; and use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) may also increase the risk of bleeding or perforation.

Chronic as well as short-term use have been shown to have a deleterious effect upon cardiovascular risk, and these agents can modestly exacerbate heart failure. Some nsNSAIDs may interfere with the beneficial antiplatelet activity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>. These issues and the factors that increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular effects are discussed in detail separately.

The overall risk of clinically evident liver injury has been estimated at only 1 to 8 per 100,000 patient-years of drug use and is due to hepatocellular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with most NSAIDs, usually occurring in the first 6 to 12 weeks of treatment and resolving within 4 to 8 weeks of discontinuation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2647688710\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical spectrum and frequency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute liver injury is uncommon and not predicted by mild increased aminotransferase levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The net hepatic risk was illustrated in a retrospective study of 625,000 patients who received more than two million prescriptions for NSAIDs and who were evaluated for newly diagnosed acute liver injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The following results were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were 23 cases of acute liver injury over the four-year study period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of acute liver injury was 3.7 per 100,000 NSAID users or 1.1 per 100,000 NSAID prescriptions; none of the cases had a fatal outcome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulindac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sulindac</a> was the only NSAID with a substantially greater risk than that of the overall NSAID group; the incidence of hepatic injury with this drug was 27 per 100,000 prescriptions. However, the liver injury associated with sulindac and the other NSAIDs was generally mild and reversible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Users of NSAIDs who had rheumatoid arthritis (RA) had a 10-fold increased risk of acute liver injury compared with NSAID-treated patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Concomitant exposure to other hepatotoxic medications probably increased the risk of hepatic injury in patients with RA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient minor increases in liver enzymes were not a useful predictor of diagnosed NSAID-associated acute liver injury.</p><p/><p>The hepatotoxicity associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulindac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulindac</a> was further studied in an analysis of reports submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This report found that sulindac injury involved women more than men and was more prevalent in patients over the age of 50. The majority of events were idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reactions.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Diclofenac</a> has been reported to cause clinical hepatitis, including antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity and histologic evidence of chronic active hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Introduction of another class of NSAID in many of these patients appeared to be safe. Severe liver injury has been reported but remains very rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Possible disease-specific risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been suggested that liver function abnormalities due to NSAIDs may be disease-specific. The possible role of the underlying disease was illustrated in a meta-analysis of over 1600 patients. This analysis studied elevations in the serum concentration of aspartate aminotransferase (AST, formerly termed serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) in patients with RA and OA taking placebo, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The principal determinants of AST concentrations were found to be the baseline AST value, the use of aspirin in patients with RA, and the use of diclofenac in patients with OA. Other significant factors included duration of therapy and, possibly, daily dose. The AST elevations were minimal and were not related to the occurrence of clinical hepatitis.</p><p>In other studies, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> caused elevated serum aminotransferase concentrations in 40 percent of patients with active juvenile inflammatory arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects/abstract/4-6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6,10</a>]. Some of these events had serious consequences.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatotoxicity is rare, and the cost-effectiveness of monitoring serum transaminase levels is uncertain. However, if the aminotransferases are noted to rise to greater than three times the upper limit of normal, if there is a fall in serum albumin (suggestive of a synthetic defect induced by the drug), or if the international normalized ratio (INR) is prolonged, NSAID toxicity should be suspected, and the potentially offending agent should be discontinued.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ANAPHYLAXIS AND ALLERGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaphylaxis to nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsNSAIDs) has been reported and is assumed to be an immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated immunologic reaction. The symptoms of anaphylaxis include (but are not limited to) urticaria, angioedema, generalized pruritus, tachycardia or bradycardia, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea and vomiting, headache, and lightheadedness. Anaphylaxis and other allergic and pseudoallergic reactions in response to NSAIDs are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Allergic and pseudoallergic reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PULMONARY EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) rarely induce pulmonary problems, although the actual incidence of adverse events is unknown. The principal pulmonary reactions that can occur include bronchospasm (which can be severe) and pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchospasm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment with cyclooxygenase (COX)-1-inhibiting (nonselective [ns]) NSAIDs may precipitate acute exacerbations of airway inflammation in patients with the condition &quot;aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease&quot; (AERD). This may present as bronchospasm in those with underlying asthma or as acute attacks of flushing, conjunctival injection, nasal congestion, and bronchospasm in those with inflammation affecting the entire respiratory tract. The latter can be difficult to distinguish from anaphylaxis. Patients with AERD may have concomitant chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to nsNSAIDs, selective COX-2 inhibitors are much less likely to trigger AERD in patients with this syndrome. Thus, the adverse effects of nsNSAIDs in AERD appear related to COX-1 inhibition. The adverse respiratory effects of NSAIDs are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Allergic and pseudoallergic reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The syndrome of pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia may occur in patients receiving NSAIDs, but this is very rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. It is not known whether this syndrome is associated with particular NSAIDs or is due to the general class. In one review, the typical presentation consisted of fever, cough, dyspnea, infiltrates on chest radiograph, and an absolute peripheral eosinophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Pathologic examination revealed poorly defined granulomas with infiltrating eosinophils. Glucocorticoids were required, along with discontinuance of the drug, in order to reverse the process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-pulmonary-eosinophilia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of pulmonary eosinophilia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMATOLOGIC EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several types of hematologic adverse effects may occur with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These include idiosyncratic and rare, but potentially serious, reactions such as neutropenia and, even less often, aplastic anemia. In addition, NSAIDs can increase bleeding risk by several mechanisms: All nonspecific NSAIDs exert direct effects upon platelets to inhibit platelet function by reducing platelet adhesion and aggregation, which can be especially problematic in patients on other antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants, and certain drug interactions by NSAIDs with other agents can also increase bleeding risk. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Neutropenia and aplastic anemia'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Antiplatelet effects'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Interaction with antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Neutropenia and aplastic anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neutropenia is an infrequent complication of NSAID therapy, probably occurring in less than 1 percent of users. Neutropenia can be induced by any of the NSAIDs. A case-control study found that the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for the occurrence of neutropenia in patients treated with NSAIDs was 4.2 compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The OR fell slightly to 3.5 when patients treated with phenylbutazone or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> were excluded. There were no specific risk factors for an event and no risks associated with particular NSAIDs; however, the number of patients treated with a single NSAID was probably too small to demonstrate a difference between drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-neutropenia-and-agranulocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced neutropenia and agranulocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some of the early NSAIDs (eg, phenylbutazone and, to a lesser degree, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>) have been associated with an increased risk for bone marrow failure (ie, aplastic anemia).

However, a causal relationship has not been proven, and the effect of these drugs on fracture healing in humans is uncertain. In studies in rodents, both nonselective and COX-2-selective NSAIDs can interfere with normal fracture healing, an effect that appears to be mediated by the inhibition of COX-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].

In the largest study included in the meta-analysis, including a cohort of nearly 10,000 patients with humeral shaft fractures, the timing of drug use was analyzed with respect to the risk of nonunion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Exposure to either nsNSAIDs or opioids in the period 61 to 90 days after the fracture was associated with nonunion; however, exposure to either drug class during earlier time periods did not correlate significantly with this complication.

Whether differences in NSAID effects between long bones and the spine are due to study design or biologic differences in the healing processes is also unclear.

Many of the toxic effects of the NSAIDs are related to their main mode of action, the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Minimizing toxicity of NSAIDs depends upon a thorough patient evaluation for characteristics that enhance the risk of developing NSAID-induced toxicity, such as specific factors that increase risk for acute renal failure or gastrointestinal toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accidental or intentional ingestion of a larger-than-recommended dose of an NSAID is typically well tolerated and does not cause serious adverse effects. However, such ingestions may be accompanied by the taking of other analgesics that may have more serious consequences, such as salicylates or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Acute NSAID overdose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonselective (ns)NSAIDs have potentially important gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular effects. Adverse gastrointestinal effects include dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, and bleeding. Renal adverse effects include acute renal failure due to renal vasoconstriction, worsening of underlying hypertension, and electrolyte and fluid abnormalities. Additionally, the risk of renal cell cancer may be increased. Cardiovascular effects include interference by some agents with the antiplatelet activity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, an effect on coronary risk, and worsening of heart failure. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal effects'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18852068\" class=\"local\">'Renal effects'</a> above and <a href=\"#H88409291\" class=\"local\">'Malignancy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevations of serum aminotransferases (transaminases) are commonly associated with NSAID use. However, these elevations are generally mild and reversible, and liver failure is quite rare. Reactions may be more common with some NSAIDs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulindac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulindac</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>) and in patients on other hepatotoxic medications or with certain disorders, including juvenile inflammatory arthritis. The potentially offending agent should be discontinued if the aminotransferases rise to greater than three times the upper limit of normal, if there is a fall in serum albumin, or if the prothrombin time is prolonged. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Hepatic injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary reactions are uncommon; they include bronchospasm and pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia. Bronchospasm can result from the condition &quot;aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease&quot; (AERD), which appears related to cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 inhibition. Patients with AERD may have concomitant chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis; inflammation affecting the entire respiratory tract may be difficult to distinguish from anaphylaxis in some patients. Anaphylaxis to NSAIDs has also been reported and is assumed to be an immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated immunologic reaction. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary effects'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Anaphylaxis and allergy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>nsNSAIDs have several important hematologic effects. The antiplatelet effects of NSAIDs, which are due to inhibition of COX-1, lead to diminished production of thromboxane A2, resulting in decreased platelet aggregation. NSAIDs should thus be avoided in patients with preexisting platelet defects and should be withheld preoperatively for at least four to five times the drug half-life. Chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> therapy slightly increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Use of nonselective nonsalicylate NSAIDs together with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> may increase the international normalized ratio (INR) and may increase bleeding risk due to the additional antiplatelet effect. Aplastic anemia has been most strongly associated with some of the early NSAIDs (eg, phenylbutazone and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>); neutropenia is seen in less than 1 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Hematologic effects'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Antiplatelet effects'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Interaction with antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Neutropenia and aplastic anemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central nervous system (CNS) side effects of NSAIDs include aseptic meningitis, psychosis, and cognitive dysfunction. Tinnitus and hearing loss are common problems, particularly with high doses of salicylates, but can occur with any NSAID. Tinnitus is typically reversible upon cessation of drug therapy and is a good warning sign to identify some of those patients who are developing high blood levels of the drug. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various skin reactions may develop in association with the use of NSAIDs. Severe, potentially life-threatening reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) are uncommon. Morbilliform rashes and urticaria are also seen. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Skin reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small increased risk of nonunion in patients with bone fractures has been reported with the use of nsNSAIDs or COX-2-selective agents. However, a causal relationship has not been proven, and the effect of these drugs on fracture healing in humans is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Possible effect on fracture healing'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Davis JS, Lee HY, Kim J, et al.
