It comprises only 2.7 percent of all digestive system malignancies in the United States; only 8600 new cases are diagnosed annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The incidence of anal cancer in the general population has increased over the last 30 years, both in the United States and elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. An increased incidence has been associated with female gender, infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), lifetime number of sexual partners, genital warts, cigarette smoking, receptive anal intercourse, and infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thus, from an etiologic standpoint, anal cancer is more similar to genital malignancies than it is to gastrointestinal tract cancers.</p><p>Substantial progress has been made in the pathophysiology and treatment of anal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In the 1960s, this malignancy was thought to be due to chronic perianal inflammation and was treated routinely by abdominoperineal resection, necessitating a permanent colostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As a result of carefully conducted epidemiologic and clinical studies, it is now known that anal cancer is associated with HPV infection and that cure of anal cancer is possible in the majority of patients with preservation of the anal sphincter.</p><p>The pathology and epidemiology of anal cancer will be reviewed here. The clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-staging-and-treatment-of-anal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, staging, and treatment of anal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND HISTOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anal canal is 2.5 to 3.5 cm long. It begins where the rectum enters the puborectalis sling at the apex of the anal sphincter complex (palpable as the anorectal ring on digital rectal examination and approximately 1 to 2 cm proximal to the dentate line) and ends where the squamous mucosa blends with the perianal skin, which roughly coincides with the palpable intersphincteric groove or the outermost boundary of the internal sphincter muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62539 \">figure 1</a>). Externally, the anal canal is surrounded by the internal and external anal sphincter muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62539 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The anal canal is divided by the dentate (pectinate) line, a macroscopically visible landmark that overlies the transition from glandular to squamous mucosa; immediately proximal to the dentate line, a narrow zone of transitional mucosa that is similar to urothelium is variably present.</p><p>The proximal region of the anus encompasses mucosa of three different histologic types: glandular, transitional, and nonkeratinizing squamous (proximal to distal, respectively). Distally, the squamous mucosa (which is devoid of epidermal appendages, such as hair follicles, apocrine glands, and sweat glands) merges with the perianal skin (true epidermis). This mucocutaneous junction has been referred to as the anal &quot;verge&quot; or margin. This boundary is indistinct on macroscopic examination, and anatomically, its location may vary with the patient's body habitus.</p><p>As a result, four distinct categories of tumors arise in the anal region:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumors that develop from any of the three types of mucosa, which cannot be visualized in their entirety while gentle traction is placed on the buttocks, are termed anal cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tumors arising in the transitional or squamous mucosa are squamous cell cancers (SCCs) and appear to behave similarly, despite their sometimes variable morphologic appearance. By convention, most series that report outcomes of &quot;anal cancer&quot; refer exclusively to these tumors. The term &quot;anal cancer,&quot; by common definition, refers to SCCs arising within the mucosa of the anus, and the two terms will be used interchangeably throughout this review.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Basaloid (also termed junctional or cloacogenic) carcinoma is a variant of SCC that arises from the epithelial transitional zone. However, these terms have largely been abandoned because these tumors are now recognized as nonkeratinizing types of SCC. Tumors arising within the anal canal above the dentate line are often nonkeratinizing SCCs, while those arising within the anal canal distal to the pectinate (dentate) line are often keratinizing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adenocarcinomas arising from glandular elements within the anal canal are rare, but they appear to share a similar natural history to rectal adenocarcinomas and are treated similarly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-staging-and-treatment-of-anal-cancer#H32\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, staging, and treatment of anal cancer&quot;, section on 'Treatment of localized adenocarcinoma of the anal canal'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumors arising within the hair-bearing skin at or distal to the squamous mucocutaneous junction have been referred to as anal margin cancers. However, the most recent (eighth) edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) cancer staging manual defines tumors that arise within the skin at or distal to the squamous mucocutaneous junction that can be seen in their entirety with gentle traction placed on the buttocks and are within 5 cm of the anus as perianal skin cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In practice, perianal skin cancers are rare.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary rectal SCCs, which are very rare, can be difficult to distinguish from anal cancers, and they should be treated according to the same approach as anal cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-staging-and-treatment-of-anal-cancer#H523512861\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, staging, and treatment of anal cancer&quot;, section on 'Rectal squamous cell cancers'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several histologic types of malignancy arise within the anus, including SCC, which is most common, adenocarcinoma, melanoma, and rarely, sarcoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76078\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76078 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Due to the variation in anatomy (particularly the transition zone), the anal canal can be quite short in length in some individuals, and the anatomical location as determined by a surgeon or endoscopist should not determine the classification of a tumor. Rather, the histology and location of tumors in the anal region guide the appropriate diagnosis and treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Anal canal tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no easily identifiable landmark between the rectum and the anus; in addition, the transition zone has a widely variable histologic appearance. As a result, the pathologic classification of tumors arising in this area may be difficult.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Squamous cell cancer &ndash; Tumors arising in the transitional or squamous mucosa are SCCs and appear to behave similarly, despite their sometimes variable morphologic appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. By convention, most series that report outcomes of &quot;anal cancer&quot; refer exclusively to these tumors. The term &quot;anal cancer,&quot; by common definition, refers to SCCs arising within the mucosa of the anus, and the two terms will be used interchangeably throughout this review.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Basaloid features are identified in approximately 25 percent of SCCs of the anal canal and must be distinguished from basal cell carcinomas of the perianal skin, which as noted below, are classified as skin cancers. Basaloid (also termed junctional or cloacogenic) carcinoma is a variant of SCC that arises from epithelial transitional zone. However, these terms have largely been abandoned because these tumors are now recognized as nonkeratinizing types of SCC. Tumors arising within the anal canal above the dentate line are termed nonkeratinizing SCCs, while those arising within the anal canal distal to the dentate line are termed keratinizing SCCs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adenocarcinomas &ndash; Adenocarcinomas arising from glandular elements within the anal canal are rare, but they appear to share a similar natural history to rectal adenocarcinomas and are treated similarly.</p><p/><p>Determination of the anatomic site of origin of carcinomas that overlap the anorectal junction can be problematic, particularly since the rectal mucosa may extend to within 1 to 2 cm of the anal verge.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Perianal skin cancers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical distinction between tumors of the anal canal and those that involve the anal &quot;margin&quot; or perianal skin can also be difficult. As noted above, SCCs that arise on any mucosal surface of the anus are treated as anal canal cancers, even if they are located distally at the perianal margin. In contrast, tumors arising within the hair-bearing skin at or distal to the squamous mucocutaneous junction have been termed anal margin cancers. However, the preferred term is perianal skin cancer, since with the exception of melanomas, tumors arising within the perianal skin behave biologically like skin cancers. Although there are essentially no prospective data validating this practice, these tumors had been classified and staged as skin cancers, rather than anal canal cancers, until more recently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The most recent (eighth) edition of the AJCC cancer staging manual departs from this practice and stages perianal skin cancers the same as anal cancers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110681\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110681 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Most clinicians treat SCC lesions of the perianal skin similarly to anal canal cancers, using radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy. Local treatment (surgery, or local RT [electrons]) is appropriate when the lesion is very separate from the anal verge and is a discrete skin lesion. However, it can be very difficult to distinguish between tumors arising on the hair-bearing skin or within the <span class=\"nowrap\">anus/anal</span> cancer. In practice, the distinction between perianal skin cancers and anal <span class=\"nowrap\">canal/margin</span> cancers can be difficult, and the default management by most clinicians is to assume that these are anal <span class=\"nowrap\">margin/canal</span> cancers if there is any doubt, and to treat with initial chemoradiotherapy rather than local therapy alone. </p><p>Tumors of the perianal skin are most often SCCs, but other types of cutaneous malignancies (eg, basal cell carcinoma, melanoma, Bowen disease, extramammary Paget disease) can arise within this region.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bowen disease (SCC in situ) can occur within the perianal skin as it can in other areas of non-sun-exposed skin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma-scc\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Melanomas that arise in either the anal canal or perianal skin should be treated according to the same principles commonly applied to this tumor at other sites. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial surgical management of melanoma of the skin and unusual sites&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paget disease of the anus, an intraepithelial adenocarcinoma, can be one of two types: a primary cutaneous malignancy in which the tumor cells show sweat gland differentiation, and a lesion in which there is involvement of adjacent squamous epithelium by lateral <span class=\"nowrap\">intramucosal/intraepithelial</span> spread from an underlying adenocarcinoma of the rectum or perianal glands.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphatic drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphatic drainage of anal canal and perianal skin cancers is dependent upon the anatomic site of origin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62539 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Tumors originating above the dentate line, similar to rectal cancers, drain to the mesorectal and internal iliac nodes. In contrast, tumors arising below the dentate line may also spread to the superficial inguinal and external iliac (deep inguinal) nodes. In contrast to earlier editions, in the eighth edition of the <span class=\"nowrap\">AJCC/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC) staging system, metastases in the inguinal, mesorectal, internal, or external iliac are all considered N1 nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110681\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110681 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although it remains an uncommon cancer, the incidence of anal cancer is increasing in the United States and other countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/2,18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18-21</a>]. In data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute, between 1973 to 1996 and 1997 to 2009, United States incidence rates for anal squamous cell cancer (SCC) increased threefold in men (from 1 to 3 per 100,000 person-years) and 1.7-fold in women (from 1.4 to 2.4 per 100,000 person-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>In certain populations, such as men who have sex with other men (MSM) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, there is an especially high incidence of anal cancer. The rate of anal cancer was estimated to be as high as 37 per 100,000 among MSM prior to the HIV epidemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], rendering its incidence in this population similar to that of cervical cancer in women prior to the introduction of cervical Papanicolaou (Pap) smear screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The incidence of anal cancer among HIV positive MSM has been estimated to be approximately twice that of HIV negative MSM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>In contrast to other common malignancies affecting HIV positive individuals (eg, Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma), the incidence of anal cancer has not declined in the era of potent antiretroviral therapy (formerly referred to as highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. This was demonstrated in a study in San Francisco County, in which the age-adjusted incidence of anal cancer in men 40 to 64 years of age (regardless of sexual orientation) more than quadrupled from the pre-HIV period (1973 to 1978) to the present era (1996 to 1999) following the widespread availability of potent antiretroviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Case reports of anal cancer developing in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) led to the conclusion that this tumor resulted from chronic inflammation in a manner similar to the development of colorectal neoplasia in patients with underlying IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].

Furthermore, in a large Danish series, none of the 1160 patients with IBD developed anal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Sexual activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial reports suggesting an increased incidence of the disease in homosexual men provided a link between sexual activity and the development of anal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/23,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,36</a>]. This relationship has been confirmed in subsequent reports, as illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a population-based case-control study of anal cancer, women with anal cancer were more likely than controls to have a history of genital warts (relative risk [RR] 32.5), herpes simplex 2 (RR 4.1), or chlamydia trachomatis (RR 2.3), while men with anal cancer were more likely than controls to have never been married (RR 8.6), to have engaged in homosexual sexual activity (RR 50), to have practiced receptive anal intercourse (RR 33), and to have a history of genital warts (RR 27) or gonorrhea (RR 17) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

In multivariate analysis, the strongest risk factors for anal cancer in women were 10 or more lifetime sexual partners (RR 4.5) and a history of anal warts (RR 11.7), genital warts (RR 4.6), gonorrhea (RR 3.3), cervical dysplasia (RR 2.3), or sexual partners with a history of a sexually transmitted disease (RR 2.4). A history of engaging in receptive anal intercourse before the age of 30 and at least two anal intercourse partners were also significant risk factors in women. Among heterosexual men, multivariate analysis revealed significantly elevated risks of anal cancer with 10 or more lifetime sexual partners (RR 2.5), a history of anal warts (RR 4.9), or a history of syphilis or hepatitis (RR 4.0).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anal cancer and cervical cancer in women &ndash; Further support for the role of sexual activity in the development of anal cancers derives from reports demonstrating a strong relationship between cervical cancer and anal cancer in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>]. In data from the Danish Cancer Registry, the odds ratio for developing anal cancer following a diagnosis of cervical cancer was significantly higher than the risk of developing either stomach or colon cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In addition, women with anal cancer had a greater likelihood of prior vulvar, vaginal, or cervical cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the SEER database, in the United States, the RR of developing anal or vaginal cancer following a diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer were 4.6 and 5.6, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Human papillomavirus infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most commonly diagnosed sexually transmitted disease in the United States and provides as least part of the link between sexual activity and anal cancer.

The spectrum of HPV types in the anal canal is similar to that described in the cervix and is associated with the same &quot;risk&quot; phenotypes.

In New York City, for example, there was a 10-fold increase in the incidence of anal cancer among men aged 20 to 49 from 1979 to 1985, concurrent with the onset of the AIDS epidemic and a marked rise in Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. In contrast, case-control studies of single men living in San Francisco did not find a significant rise in the incidence of anal cancer from before the appearance of AIDS in about 1980 to the late 1980s, a period in which there was an increased incidence of both Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/39,71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,71,72</a>].

It is possible that HIV infection interacts with HPV to predispose to anal cancer. In a cohort of 346 HIV infected and 262 HIV negative homosexual men, infection with multiple anal HPV types was more common in the HIV infected patients (73 versus 23 percent) and was associated with significant immunosuppression (CD4 count below <span class=\"nowrap\">200/microL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].
