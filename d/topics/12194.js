The rheumatoid factor (RF), as initially described by Waaler and Rose in 1940 and as commonly measured in clinical practice, is an IgM RF, although other immunoglobulin types, including IgG and IgA, have been described.</p><p>Testing for RF is primarily used for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, RF may also be present in other rheumatic diseases and chronic infections.</p><p>The origin of rheumatoid factors and the clinical utility of their measurement are reviewed here. Discussions of clinically useful biologic markers in RA, including rheumatoid factor, and of the diagnosis of RA are presented separately.

An abnormal immune response appears to select, via antigenic stimulation, high-affinity RF from the host's natural antibody repertoire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This may occur in rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and in a number of inflammatory diseases characterized by chronic antigen exposure, such as subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE). The development of RF after such infections has suggested that they represent an antibody response to antibodies that have reacted with microbes. This possibility is supported by experimental evidence showing that mice immunized with IgM-coated vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) develop rheumatoid factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Normal human lymphoid tissue commonly possesses B lymphocytes with RF expression on the cell surface. However, RF is not routinely detectable in the circulation in the absence of an antigenic stimulus. Modified immunoglobulin G (IgG) could be a stimulus to RF production and could be an important component of RA pathogenesis; this concept is supported by studies that observed an association of RF and more severe RA with autoantibodies to advanced glycated end-product (AGE)-damaged IgG or agalactosyl IgG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Costimulation of B cells, perhaps mediated by toll-like receptors (TLRs), may allow B cells with low-affinity receptors for IgG to become activated. TLRs are components of the innate immune system, and they provide signals after engaging various bacterial and viral products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

Furthermore, RF found in the peripheral blood probably originates within the bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Synovial fluid RF may be produced by synovium-derived CD20-negative, CD38-positive plasma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circulating B cells require interleukin (IL)-10 for RF production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In RF-negative patients with RA, B cells capable of RF production are fewer in number and are less responsive to T-cell help than in RF-positive patients with RA.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'When is it useful to measure RF?'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>RFs possess significant heterogeneity related to mutations within heavy and light chain genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, IgM RFs from patients with RA react with a variety of antigenic sites on autologous IgG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. They may also react against a variety of cellular and tissue antigens but may have different biologic activity in different hosts and anatomic locations. As an example, one report of RF derived from synovial tissue lymphocytes in a patient with RA found specificity for gastric glands, nuclei, and smooth muscle; in contrast, RF derived from a control patient's peripheral blood did not show this pattern of reactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Possible functions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The function of RF is poorly understood.

A high correlation for RF has been noted among identical twins with RA, suggesting that genetic factors influence both RF function and disease development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, some studies have shown that patients with RF-negative RA have HLA susceptibility alleles similar to those in RF-positive patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. There may, therefore, be a similar immunogenetic predisposition to RA in these patients that is independent of RF.</p><p>One model of RA pathogenesis places RF in a key etiopathogenic role as an antibody to immune complexes that activates the complement cascade and promotes production of inflammatory mediators, thereby facilitating a state of ongoing inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. There is in vitro evidence that RF may promote inflammatory cytokine production through interactions with anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) immune complexes in patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL DISORDERS ASSOCIATED WITH RF POSITIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A positive rheumatoid factor (RF) test can be found in rheumatic disorders, in nonrheumatic disorders, and in healthy subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Rheumatic disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may have detectable serum RF in a variety of rheumatic disorders, many of which share similar features, such as symmetric polyarthritis and constitutional symptoms.

Although ACPA and RF have similar sensitivity for the diagnosis of RA, ACPA is a more specific marker for RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Retrospective study of stored blood samples collected as part of routine blood donation has demonstrated that nearly 30 percent of those who later develop RA have serum RF present for a year or more prior to diagnosis (median 4.5 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Likewise, among military recruits who are diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgM RF in banked serum often precedes the development of arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The presence of both RF and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) in apparently healthy people substantially increases the probability of developing RA, with the presence of the two autoantibodies associated with a relative risk of approximately 70 in a population study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. However, most asymptomatic persons with a positive RF do not progress to RA or SLE; as a result, measurement of RF is a poor screening test for future rheumatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Predictive and diagnostic value</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of RF vary depending upon the populations being examined, which will also affect the calculated predictive value. As noted, the sensitivity of RF in RA (ie, the proportion of patients with RA who are RF-positive) has ranged from 26 to 90 percent. A meta-analysis reported the overall sensitivity to be 69 percent (95% CI 65-73 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical disorders associated with RF positivity'</a> above.)</p><p>The specificity (ie, the proportion of a control population without RF) depends substantially upon the choice of the control group. The overall specificity of RF reported in heterogeneous publications analyzed as part of a meta-analysis was 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. As described above, the prevalence of RF in a young healthy population is about 4 percent; therefore, the specificity with respect to a young, healthy population is about 96 percent. The specificity with respect to disease control populations is substantially lower, especially if the disease control populations include patients with rheumatic and other diseases associated with RF.</p><p>As with any diagnostic test, however, the predictive value is also affected by the estimated likelihood of disease prior to ordering the test (ie, the pre-test probability) and, with RF, by the proportion of patients with a nonrheumatic disorder associated with RF production (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74945 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>In a study of consecutive tests ordered by healthcare providers in a large academic medical center in the US, the prevalence of RA was approximately 13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The positive predictive value of RF (the likelihood of having disease if the RF is positive) was only 24 percent for RA and 34 percent for any rheumatic disease. Thus, RF has a low positive predictive value if the test is ordered among patients with a low prevalence of RF-associated rheumatic disease or with few clinical features of systemic rheumatic disease.</p><p>In contrast, RF testing, while imperfect, is often useful in evaluating patients presenting with inflammatory arthritis and with a high pre-test probability of RA. RF testing in a rheumatology clinic practice with a prevalence of RA of 16.4 percent demonstrated a specificity of 97 to 98 percent in patients with noninflammatory disorders and of 95 to 97 percent in all patients, yielding a positive predictive value of about 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In patients with &quot;undifferentiated&quot; inflammatory arthritis, the presence of RF was helpful in predicting the ultimate diagnosis of RA, with a positive odds ratio of approximately 30 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. While an earlier study found no predictive value for RF testing in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>], most studies of patients in early arthritis clinics demonstrate that RF, as well as ACPA, contributes to the ability to predict persistent synovitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>Thus, the positive predictive value of RF testing is poor in a population with a low pre-test probability of RA, including those without inflammatory arthritis. Testing patients with nonspecific arthralgia, fibromyalgia, or osteoarthritis is not recommended because a positive test result is likely to represent a false-positive result. By contrast, RF testing for patients with inflammatory arthritis (which is much less common than the noninflammatory conditions) has high positive predictive value and clinical utility.</p><p>The calculated negative predictive value of the RF (the likelihood of not having disease if the RF is negative) tends to be high in a population with a low pre-test probability of RA. However, a negative RF in this setting may not be particularly useful clinically. In our study, the negative predictive values for RA and for any rheumatic disease were 89 and 85 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. It is important to appreciate, however, that the value of a negative test depends upon the clinical setting. Suppose, for example, that a patient has an estimated 10 percent chance of RA; a negative RF test (assuming a sensitivity of 70 percent and specificity of 85 percent) will decrease the likelihood of RA from 10 percent to 4 percent. This small benefit may not justify performing the RF test.</p><p>The negative predictive value of RF in patients with a high pre-test likelihood of RA is limited by the relatively high frequency of seronegative RA. For example, if the pre-test probability is 50 percent and if the sensitivity is 70 percent, the post-test probability is 27 percent (ie, not low enough to feel confident that RA is not the diagnosis).</p><p>The presence or absence of RF may have some value in predicting response to treatment. As an example, the anti-CD20 B cell depleting monoclonal antibody, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, may be less effective for patients with seronegative RA than for those with seropositive RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Conversely, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy may be less effective in RF-positive RA than in seronegative disease. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. In addition, the presence of RF among patients with RA may be associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">RF titer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The titer of RF should be considered when analyzing its utility. The higher the titer, the greater is the likelihood that the patient has a rheumatic disease. There are, however, frequent exceptions to this rule, particularly among patients with one of the chronic inflammatory disorders noted above. Furthermore, the use of a higher titer for diagnosis decreases the sensitivity of the test as it simultaneously increases the specificity (by decreasing the incidence of false-positive results). In our study, for example, an RF titer of 1:40 or greater was 28 percent sensitive and 87 percent specific for RA; in comparison, a titer of 1:640 or greater increased the specificity to 99 percent (ie, almost no false-positive results) but reduced the sensitivity to 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognostic value</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RF-positive patients with RA may experience more aggressive and erosive joint disease and extraarticular manifestations than those who are RF-negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/73-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-75</a>]. Similar findings have been observed in juvenile idiopathic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. These general observations, however, are of limited utility in an individual patient because of wide interpatient variability. In addition, the effect of RF status on radiographic progression may be decreasing in the era of earlier and more effective therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Accurate prediction of the disease course is not possible from the RF alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HLA and other susceptibility genes in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some have suggested that erosive disease may be accurately predicted by analyzing the combination of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 and RF status among patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. However, these tests are of limited value in an individual patient as almost one-half of &quot;high risk&quot; patients had no erosions at one year. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=investigational-biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Investigational biologic markers in the diagnosis and assessment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Genetic factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H236242671\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biologic markers in the diagnosis and assessment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Genetic factors'</a>.)</p><p>RF status may be useful in combination with other indicators, including C-reactive protein, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and severity of synovitis on physical exam, to predict progression of radiographic changes in RA patients and to guide treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>].

However, there is no clear benefit to serial testing in a patient with established RA. In Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, the disappearance of a previously positive RF may herald the onset of lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>], so some clinicians check RF repeatedly in their patients with Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome. The clinical utility of this practice, however, has not been critically assessed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease#H52196773\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome: Extraglandular disease&quot;, section on 'Prevalence and risk'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease#H53038499\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome: Extraglandular disease&quot;, section on 'Autoantibodies'</a>.)</p><p>RF titer may fall with effective treatment of RA in patients who are originally RF-positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Nevertheless, the fluctuation in level of RF does not correlate closely with disease activity. RF should not be used routinely to monitor RA disease activity in clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2374481\"><span class=\"h2\">Analytical considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of RF can be detected by a variety of techniques. These include agglutination of IgG-sensitized sheep red cells or of bentonite or latex particles coated with human IgG; radioimmunoassay; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); and nephelometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/83-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-88</a>]. Measurement of RF is not standardized in many laboratories, leading to problems with inconsistent results. Although no one technique has clear advantage over others, automated methods, such as nephelometry and ELISA, tend to be more reproducible than manual methods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Cost</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of the RF titer is generally inexpensive. However, the cost per true-positive result may be high if the test is ordered in patients with a low prevalence of disease. In a retrospective analysis of 563 patients studied over a six-month period, for example, the cost per true-positive RF result was $563 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rheumatoid factors are antibodies directed against the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG). Normal human lymphoid tissue commonly possesses B lymphocytes with rheumatoid factor (RF) expression on the cell surface. However, RF is not routinely detectable in the circulation in the absence of an antigenic stimulus. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How chronic infections and rheumatic diseases lead to increased RF in serum is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether RF has a physiologic function is uncertain, though some potentially pathogenic and other potentially beneficial activities have been suggested. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Possible functions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rheumatoid factor is detected in the setting of various rheumatic diseases, in infections, in other inflammatory diseases, and in some healthy people. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical disorders associated with RF positivity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no clear consensus regarding the indications for ordering the RF. The overall utility of this test may be historically overestimated, and the pre-test probability of RF-associated disease as well as confounding inflammatory disorders should be considered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of RF has little value as a screening test to diagnose or exclude rheumatic disease in either healthy populations or in those with arthralgias. We recommend not screening healthy individuals by testing for RF (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'When is it useful to measure RF?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest not using the RF as a diagnostic test in patients who have arthralgias but who have no other symptoms or signs of a rheumatic disease (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'When is it useful to measure RF?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The RF has a higher positive predictive value if ordered more selectively in patients with a modest or higher chance of having an RF-associated rheumatic disease such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, or the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome. Included in this group are patients with prominent morning stiffness, sicca symptoms, or arthralgia or arthritis in a rheumatoid distribution (ie, symmetric polyarthritis involving small joints). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Predictive and diagnostic value'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The negative predictive value of RF is limited by the significant prevalence of RF-negative RA and by the low clinical utility of RF testing in patients with nonspecific arthralgia (since RF-associated rheumatic disease is relatively uncommon in that population). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Predictive and diagnostic value'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher titers of RF have a higher positive predictive value for RA. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'RF titer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although, in aggregate, seropositive disease and higher titers of RF are associated with more severe RA, measurement of RF has limited prognostic value in the individual patient with RA. When RF is combined with other clinical data (such as C-reactive protein and joint count), prediction can be improved but is still limited.
