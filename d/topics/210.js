It causes scaly, rough, or bumpy spots on the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82193\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82193 \">picture 1</a>). If an area of skin has more than one spot, the spots are called &quot;actinic keratoses.&quot;</p><p>AK is most common in people who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spend a lot of time outside, or did when they were young &ndash; People who work outside, such as farmers and lifeguards, have a higher risk of AK.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have fair (light) skin and hair</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have freckles</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sunburn easily</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannot get a tan easily</p><p/><p>AK is more common in older people. This is because sun damage builds up over time. Both men and women get AK, but it is more common in men. AK is not common in people with olive-colored or dark skin.</p><p>Having one or more painful sunburns in your life raises your risk of getting AK.</p><p>Common places for AK include the:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scalp, in people who are bald or losing their hair</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Face</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Side of the neck</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Backs of the hands and forearms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Legs or feet, especially in women</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13282799\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of actinic keratosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AK looks like an abnormal area of skin. The area of skin can be:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Red and swollen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thick, crusty, or scaly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smooth and red</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sticking up, pointed, and hard like a finger nail</p><p/><p>One kind of AK can happen on the lip. It can cause a rough, dry, or scaly spot. The lip might also crack or get a sore on it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13282814\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Show your doctor or nurse any changes in your skin. AK can turn into a form of skin cancer called &quot;squamous cell carcinoma.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13282829\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for actinic keratosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No, there is no one test. The doctor or nurse will do an exam and check your skin. He or she can usually tell if you have AK by looking at any skin changes and touching them.</p><p>If the doctor is not sure whether AK is causing the skin changes, you will have a test called a biopsy. You might also have a biopsy if a spot is hard, bleeding, growing quickly, or larger than a certain size.</p><p>During a biopsy, a doctor takes a small sample from the abnormal area of skin. Or he or she takes out the whole area. Then another doctor looks at the skin under a microscope to check for skin cancer.</p><p>The doctor can also do a different test. In this test, he or she looks at the skin with a small microscope that has a light on it. The doctor holds this over the area with skin changes. The microscope and light help the doctor see under the skin. It can help show if a spot is an AK or something else.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13282844\"><span class=\"h1\">How is actinic keratosis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A few people have AK that goes away on its own. This usually only happens in younger people. Most AK needs treatment. The spots can grow, spread, and turn into skin cancer.</p><p>The right treatment depends on the size of the AK, where it is on the body, and whether there are one or more spots.</p><p>Doctors can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Freeze the AK off with a special cold liquid (called liquid nitrogen)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do surgery to remove the AK</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give a strong cream or gel to put on the AK &ndash; The medicine in the cream or gel can get rid of the AK. If you have an area of skin with several AKs, the doctor might tell you to put cream or gel on that whole area.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the AK with a strong chemical</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do therapy with lights &ndash; In this treatment, a doctor puts cream on the skin. This makes it sensitive to a special kind of light. Then, he or she shines the special light on the skin. This reacts with the cream to get rid of AKs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13282859\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, you need to be checked to see if the AK comes back or you get more AKs. The doctor will do an exam and check your skin for changes. You should also keep checking your skin for any new changes. Show any changes you find to your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13282876\"><span class=\"h1\">Can actinic keratosis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can help prevent AK by protecting your skin from the sun. To lower the chance of getting AK, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stay out of the sun in the middle of the day (from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear sunscreen &ndash; An SPF of at least 30 is best. The SPF number is on the sunscreen bottle or tube.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear a wide-brimmed hat, long-sleeved shirt, long pants, or long skirt outside.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Not</strong> use tanning beds</p><p/><p>Even if you already had treatment for AK, protecting your skin can help keep you from getting more.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13282908\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-cancer-non-melanoma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Skin cancer (non-melanoma) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunburn-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sunburn (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunburn-prevention-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sunburn prevention (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunburn-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sunburn (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
