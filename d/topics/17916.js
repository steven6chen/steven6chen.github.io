While rare in most parts of the world, nasopharyngeal carcinoma is endemic in southern China, southeast Asia, north Africa, and the arctic, where undifferentiated, nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma is the predominant histology.</p><p>The treatment of residual, recurrent, and metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer is presented here.

The location of the nasopharynx, its proximity to vital organs, the high radiation doses given for primary therapy, and chemotherapy and radiation resistance induced by previous therapy make retreatment challenging.</p><p>The stage at the time of recurrence (rTNM) and the interval between the initial treatment and recurrence are important prognostic factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110658\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110658 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-and-metastatic-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].

Surgery in this setting is technically challenging. The goal is to achieve an adequate margin while preserving the neurovascular bundle and restoring critical mucosal barriers. While anterior approaches are most commonly used, endoscopic nasopharyngectomy in selected patients may achieve comparable results with reduced complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-and-metastatic-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p>Robotic surgery may have an application for nasopharyngectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-and-metastatic-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a limited cohort of patients reported from Sun Yat-sen Cancer Center, endoscopic resection, when compared with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), may be more effective in maximizing survival with increased quality of life and decreased treatment-related complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-and-metastatic-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Serious surgical complications include meningitis (the most common cause of perioperative mortality), osteoradionecrosis, necrosis of the free flap, and aspiration pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-and-metastatic-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>]. Other commonly seen complications include middle ear effusion, hypernasality, nasal regurgitation, cerebrospinal rhinorrhea, ectropion, temporary and permanent infra-orbital numbness, trismus, epiphora (watering eyes), impaired swallowing, and oropalatal fistula.</p><p>Three-year survival rates as high as 60 percent after salvage surgery have been reported for carefully selected patients, but a survival benefit may be restricted to those with T1 or T2 recurrent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-and-metastatic-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>].

The benefit from treatment was limited to undifferentiated and nonkeratinizing NPC (typically Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] associated) as opposed to well-differentiated disease (non-EBV associated).

These treatments are associated with significant serious toxicities but may result in long-term survival.
