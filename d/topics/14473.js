The successful prevention of infection in the solid organ transplant recipient requires an understanding of these factors in order to develop a preventive strategy adapted for each individual. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-for-infection-before-solid-organ-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation for infection before solid organ transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection in the solid organ transplant recipient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Epidemiologic exposures may have occurred many years before transplantation or at any point following the transplant procedure. The range of pathogens to which patients are exposed has increased as transplantation has become available to a broader range of individuals with more varied epidemiologic exposures and as transplant recipients survive longer, remaining on lifelong immunosuppression. Thus, clinicians must obtain a detailed history of encounters with potential pathogens, even if the exposure was relatively remote [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The use of antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis varies by the disease being targeted for prevention and the nature of the recipient's risks. Strategies include universal prophylaxis and preemptive therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Universal prophylaxis</strong> involves giving an antimicrobial agent to all patients considered to be at increased risk for infection during a defined period. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX) is given universally to all transplant recipients who do not have sulfa allergies. TMP-SMX is effective for the prevention of <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia (PCP), which occurs in many United States transplantation centers at an overall rate of 10 to 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It provides effective prophylaxis against other pathogens, including <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> and <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Pneumocystis pneumonia'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A <strong>preemptive approach</strong> involves using sensitive assays (eg, antigen detection or molecular assays) to monitor patients at predefined intervals to detect pathogen replication (eg, viremia) before infection progresses to invasive disease. A positive assay triggers the initiation of antimicrobial therapy, a reduction in the intensity of immunosuppression, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intensified monitoring.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With intensification of immunosuppressive therapies for transplantation, notably T cell&ndash;depleting antibody induction therapies, more recipients now receive some period of antiviral prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus (CMV) following induction therapy, most often for the seronegative organ recipient who receives an organ from a seropositive donor <span class=\"nowrap\">(D+/R-)</span> or the seropositive recipient (R+).

Some tests are recommended for all patients, while others are useful in selected patients with suggestive epidemiologic risk factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59792\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59792 \">table 1</a>). Assessment of microbial colonization patterns may guide peritransplant prophylaxis for bacteria (methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> [MRSA], vancomycin-resistant enterococcus [VRE], carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae [CRE]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Some data may be available from prior microbiologic evaluations (eg, microbiology from bronchoscopic evaluations) or prior infections (eg, <em>Clostridium difficile</em> colitis). Individuals with chronic infections should have all organisms identified and susceptibility testing performed prior to transplantation as a guide to peritransplant prophylaxis. Serologic testing is used as an indicator of significant past exposures, and, in some cases (eg, cytomegalovirus serostatus), the results are used to guide prophylactic strategies after transplantation. In other cases, the results are used to guide pretransplant immunizations. These issues are discussed in detail separately.

However, many immunocompromised patients are unable to mount protective immune responses to vaccines. Furthermore, immunization with live-virus vaccines may result in unchecked proliferation of attenuated vaccine strains and is therefore generally avoided in solid organ transplant recipients. For these reasons, it is optimal to immunize patients prior to transplantation.</p><p>Vaccine recommendations for solid organ transplant candidates and recipients are summarized in the following Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91883\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91883 \">table 2</a>) and are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in solid organ transplant candidates and recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening for latent TB</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In one compilation of published cases, the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in transplant recipients worldwide ranged from 0.35 to 15 percent, which reflected an 8- to 100-fold increased incidence over the general population in the represented countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Reactivation of latent disease following immunosuppression is thought to be the dominant factor in the pathogenesis of infection in these hosts, although transmission with the allograft, nosocomial transmission, and community-acquired tuberculosis have been documented in solid organ transplant recipients.</p><p>Given the high morbidity associated with TB in the posttransplant setting, all patients listed for organ transplantation should undergo tuberculin skin testing (TST) or TB interferon-gamma release assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition to TST, baseline chest radiographs should be obtained for anyone with epidemiologic history suggestive of exposure to tuberculosis. For patients with uremia, liver failure, and for those who have received corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive therapies, TST must be interpreted according to the more sensitive standards developed for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.</p><p>T cell&ndash;based interferon-gamma release assays, such as the QuantiFERON Gold TB (QFT-G) assay, are a useful alternative to TST with a high degree of concordance between TSTs and the QFT-G assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Although some studies have suggested that QFT-G correlates better with the risk of TB in immunocompromised patients than the TST, data remain limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and false-negative results have been reported for both tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a study of liver transplant candidates, indeterminate QFT-G results were more likely in those with more advanced liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Patients may receive one of a variety of regimens for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The routine use of anti-TB prophylaxis after transplantation remains controversial but is generally provided to anyone with high risk of active infection.</p><p>Treatment after transplantation is frequently compromised by drug toxicities and interactions with immunosuppressive therapies. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Isoniazid</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrazinamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyrazinamide</a> hepatotoxicity, for example, may be intolerable after liver transplantation. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rifampin</a> will significantly reduce the serum level of calcineurin inhibitors, an effect that persists for a number of weeks after cessation of therapy.

Accordingly, antimicrobial prophylaxis is often started on call to the operating room, although the specific type of prophylaxis is typically tailored according to the organ transplanted and may need to be further individualized based on the recipient's unique risks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibacterial prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard surgical antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for all organ transplant procedures. However, the choice of drug(s) can vary with the type of transplant. The unique technical features of transplantation (vascular, ureteric, tracheal, biliary anastomoses) predispose to leaks (hematoma, bile leak, lymphocele). Such fluid collections are common sites of infection. As an example, the risk of peritoneal soilage is great in individuals undergoing liver transplantation with Roux-en-Y biliary drainage. Other risk factors for bacterial infections after liver transplantation include large-volume blood transfusions, treatment of graft rejection with glucocorticoids, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. If the patient is colonized with methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus </em>(MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant <em>Enterococcus </em>(VRE), perioperative prophylaxis should be expanded to cover the resistant organisms. Active infections must be eradicated or controlled prior to transplantation.</p><p>Colonization with resistant gram-negative organisms poses a special hazard to patients undergoing organ transplantation. In endemic areas, a 3 to 10 percent incidence of carbapenem-resistant <em>Klebsiella pneumonia </em>(CRKP) infection is reported in liver, kidney, lung, or heart recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) carry a mortality rate of up to 40 percent once established in organ recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Many bacterial infections in lung transplant recipients involve the lower respiratory tract (bronchitis and pneumonia) and occur in the first two weeks posttransplant. Patients with chronic bronchiectasis and those with cystic fibrosis, who are colonized with resistant gram-negative bacteria including <em>Pseudomonas</em> and <em>Burkholderia </em>species, present a dilemma with regard to increased risk of lung transplantation. Some centers consider colonization with <em>Burkholderia cenocepacia</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] or pan-resistant <em>Pseudomonas </em>species a contraindication to transplantation.</p><p>No consensus exists for the management of patients colonized with these gram-negative organisms during the peritransplant period. Each transplant center typically develops antibiotic prophylaxis protocols based upon the susceptibility patterns of the organisms most frequently recovered at that center. Prophylactic regimens are then individualized on the basis of both recipient organisms and those isolated from the donor lungs. Serial microbiology data posttransplantation are used to refine therapy.</p><p>Infections of ventricular assist devices and chest tubes are often due to gram-positive organisms (staphylococci, enterococci) or yeasts, which should be identified, and susceptibility testing used to guide therapy prior to and through transplantation. Drains and vascular access catheters must be removed as quickly as is feasible posttransplantation. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial prophylaxis (including antifungal agents) is generally reserved for the perioperative management of intestinal transplants since their use increases the risk of <em>C. difficile</em> colitis and superinfection with resistant fungal organisms.</p><p>In addition, if the organ donor is known to be colonized or infected with potential pathogens including multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) such as CRE, prophylaxis should be extended in the recipient to avoid postoperative infections. Often, donor data become available only after implantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Antifungal prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of invasive fungal infections following solid organ transplantation ranges from 3 to 42 percent and varies with the organ being transplanted and the epidemiology at individual centers. <em>Candida</em> and <em>Aspergillus</em> species are the leading causative agents, with the median time to onset following transplantation depending on the type of transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. These infections are associated with high overall mortality rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/19-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-25</a>]. As an example, in a multicenter retrospective study of 1963 cardiac, heart-lung, and lung transplant recipients in Italy reported fungal infections in 51 patients (2.6 percent) occurring at a median of 58 days posttransplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. <em>Aspergillus</em> and <em>Candida</em> spp accounted for 64 and 23 percent of the cases, respectively, with mortality rates of 29 and 33 percent, respectively.</p><p>The epidemiologic history of the individual patient and known colonization patterns are used to guide posttransplantation prophylaxis. In endemic regions, long-term prophylaxis may be employed to prevent the reactivation of pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease due to <em>Coccidioides immitis</em>, <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>, and <em>Cryptococcus neoformans</em>. Prospective, randomized clinical trials are lacking to support the routine use of antifungal prophylaxis outside of lung transplantation and in regions or institutions with high intrinsic rates of fungal infection. We recommend a targeted approach to antifungal prophylaxis for high-risk patients, including those transplant recipients known to be colonized and in hospitals with high rates of invasive fungal infections.</p><p>In programs with a high incidence of infection due to <em>Aspergillus</em>, <em>Histoplasma</em>, or <em>Candida</em> species, both epidemiologic protection (eg, high-efficiency particulate air [HEPA] filtered air supply within the hospital) and antifungal prophylaxis (as appropriate to the common isolates) may be utilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>].

Drug interactions (especially between the azole antifungal agents and calcineurin inhibitors and rapamycin) and toxicities must be considered for each antimicrobial selection, both at initiation and cessation of therapy.</p><p>Strategies should be developed for each institution based upon the incidence and nature of fungal infections observed. Current data support the use of prophylaxis for <em>Aspergillus</em> in liver and lung transplant recipients and for <em>Candida</em> species in liver, bowel, and pancreas transplant recipients. Given the potential for toxicities of antifungal agents and the risk for emergence of resistance, strategies for antifungal prophylaxis should not be universal but instead should be targeted toward high-risk patients and adapted to the common pathogens at each center.</p><p>The overall efficacy of antifungal prophylaxis in solid organ transplant recipients was evaluated in a meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials with 1497 participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Patients with prolonged hospitalizations or who require mechanical ventilation are at particularly high risk. The infections commonly encountered in the first month after transplantation are caused by the nosocomial pathogens that infect other complex postoperative patients. Ninety-five percent of these infections are due to bacterial and fungal agents.

Prevention of infections other than PCP and toxoplasmosis is likely to require daily administration. In addition, TMP-SMX will suppress <em>Isospora belli</em> (based upon experience in HIV-infected patients) and most <em>L. monocytogenes</em> and <em>Nocardia asteroides</em> (based upon susceptibility data). However, infections due to <em>Nocardia</em> species (including <em>N. nova</em>) have been observed in both hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplant recipients receiving TMP-SMX.

Prior to the use of TMP-SMX prophylaxis, the incidence of infection was 10 to 15 percent in most programs and was reported to be as high as 70 to 88 percent in the lung transplant population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/21,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,50</a>]. The effectiveness of prophylaxis against PCP has virtually eliminated the organism as a cause of significant morbidity in solid organ transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

The distinct advantages of TMP-SMX prophylaxis include low cost, low toxicity in most individuals, and efficacy in the prevention of many common urinary, respiratory, and gastrointestinal infections as well as most, but not all, infections due to <em>Toxoplasma</em> and <em>Listeria</em> species. TMP-SMX may also provide some degree of protection against infection with <em>Nocardia</em> spp, although breakthrough infections have been reported.

Given that cysts of <em>T. gondii</em> are commonly found in muscle tissues (as well as brain and phagocytic cells), the greatest risk for toxoplasmosis occurs after cardiac transplantation. The highest risk group for symptomatic reactivation disease occurs in seronegative recipients of heart transplants from seropositive donors; the risk in this group in the absence of prophylaxis is approximately 50 to 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. <em>Toxoplasma</em> infection presents most often as myocarditis or cardiomyopathy but also as brain abscess, pneumonitis, empyema, or disseminated infection.

Although uncommon, toxoplasmosis has also been transmitted by liver, kidney, and lung transplantation. Organ-transmitted disease is generally more severe than that due to reactivation of latent infection in the recipient. The risk of disease reactivation appears to be increased by use of lymphocyte-depleting induction therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Prevention of toxoplasmosis has not been well studied.

One retrospective study suggests that TMP-SMX at a dose of one double-strength tablet three times per week is sufficient for both <em>Pneumocystis</em> and <em>Toxoplasma</em> prevention in cardiac transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Lower dose regimens provide less effective protection, notably in seronegative cardiac transplant recipients from seropositive donors from endemic regions (eg, France, the Caribbean islands) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The risk of disease in seropositive recipients of heart transplants from seropositive donors is uncertain, but lifetime prophylaxis with at least one single-strength tablet of TMP-SMX daily may be beneficial.</p><p>Most alternative regimens (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfadiazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfadiazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atovaquone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atovaquone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrimethamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyrimethamine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primaquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">primaquine</a>) have not been well studied in high-risk transplant populations. The clindamycin-pyrimethamine regimen has been used successfully in some programs as an alternative for those who are intolerant of TMP-SMX. Dapsone may also be considered in such individuals, although breakthrough infections have been observed at daily doses of 50 mg when pyrimethamine or TMP-SMX has not been included in the regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunocompromised individuals have a high incidence of infection due to <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> with diminished susceptibility to penicillin; many of these isolates are also resistant to TMP-SMX.

This has occurred in HBsAg-positive donors and in livers from donors with documented anti&ndash;hepatitis B core antibody. A review from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Liver Transplantation Database identified 23 liver transplants from isolated anti&ndash;hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc)-positive donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].

Transmission of HBV is uncommon in this setting and these donor organs are frequently transplanted to expand the pool of available kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Recipients should be immunized against HBV prior to their use.</p><p>Given the availability of vaccination and effective therapies for HBV, transplantation of organs from HBV-infected donors may be considered on an individual basis. These donors are generally not viremic but are anti-HB core antibody positive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Hepatitis C virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the approval of interferon-free, direct-acting antiviral drug regimens for treatment of HCV, transplant physicians have greater ability to treat hepatitis C&ndash;infected patients under consideration for solid organ transplantation. However, whether HCV treatment should be administered before or after transplant should be individualized, as a response to pretransplant treatment may prolong the recipient's waiting time for transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>]. HCV-infected renal transplant recipients generally receive antiviral therapy before transplantation. HCV-infected liver transplant candidates may lower their Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score while waiting for transplantation, including those with cirrhosis and fibrosis; those with lower MELD scores are lower on the transplant waiting list than those with higher scores, resulting in a longer waiting period for an organ. Thus, most liver transplant candidates are likely to prefer waiting until after transplantation for HCV therapy. The availability of direct-acting antiviral regimens has increased the use of potentially infected organ donors and of hepatitis C&ndash;infected donor organs in hepatitis C&ndash;uninfected recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>], with posttransplant <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;prophylaxis/eradication&quot;</span> therapy administered to the recipient.

Increasingly, HIV-infected individuals may also be considered as donors for HIV-infected recipients. The care of HIV-infected and co-infected recipients (eg, HIV and HCV infected) requires expertise in the management of drug interactions among the drugs required for maintenance of immunosuppression and antiviral therapy in the post-transplant period. In general, stable antiretroviral regimens with omission of protease inhibitors is preferred to limit interactions with the calcineurin inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].

Strategies include universal and targeted prophylaxis:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX) is given universally to all transplant recipients who do not have sulfa allergies. TMP-SMX is effective for the prevention of <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia (PCP), which occurs in many United States transplantation centers at an overall rate of 10 to 14 percent. It is also effective prophylaxis against <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> and <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Pneumocystis pneumonia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A preemptive approach involves using sensitive assays (eg, antigen detection or molecular assays) to monitor patients at predefined intervals to detect pathogen replication (eg, viremia) before infection progresses to invasive disease. A positive assay triggers the initiation of antimicrobial therapy, a reduction in the intensity of immunosuppression, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intensified monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before transplantation, it is important to establish the patient's immunization history and prior infectious exposures, including travel, to design an appropriate preventative regimen. Laboratory testing for evidence of past infectious exposures is performed to detect asymptomatic infection in the transplant candidate. Some tests are recommended for all patients, while others are useful in selected patients with suggestive epidemiologic risk factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59792\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59792 \">table 1</a>). Serologic testing is used as an indicator of significant past exposures and, in some cases (eg, cytomegalovirus [CMV] serostatus), the results are used to guide prophylactic strategies after transplantation. In other cases, the results are used to guide pretransplant immunizations. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pretransplant prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following transplantation, recipients are vulnerable to nosocomial infections, especially in the early posttransplant period. Patients with prolonged hospitalizations or who require mechanical ventilation are at particularly high risk. The infections commonly encountered in the first month after transplantation are caused by the same nosocomial pathogens that infect other complex postoperative patients. Ninety-five percent of these infections are due to bacterial and fungal agents. However, the difficulty in eradication of such infections is increased in the immunocompromised host. The unique technical features of transplantation (vascular, ureteric, tracheal, biliary anastomoses) predispose to leaks (hematoma, bile, lymphocele). Such fluid collections are a common site of infection. Individuals with chronic infections should have all organisms identified and susceptibility testing performed prior to transplantation. Active infections must be eradicated or controlled prior to transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Peritransplantation prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After discharge from the hospital, the recipient is likely to have contacts with a variety of potential pathogens within the community. Most patients receive TMP-SMX (one single-strength tablet per day [80 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">TMP/160</span> mg SMX] or one double-strength tablet three to seven times a week) to prevent PCP and certain other infections (eg, <em>L. monocytogenes</em>, <em>T. gondii</em>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Peritransplantation prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaccination remains the primary method of preventing and controlling influenza and continual changes in viral antigens necessitates annual revision and administration of the influenza vaccine. The intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-virus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inactivated influenza vaccine</a> should be given to solid organ transplant recipients. The intranasal live-attenuated influenza vaccine should <strong>not</strong> be given to solid organ transplant recipients since live viral vaccines are contraindicated in immunocompromised hosts. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Influenza'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytomegalovirus is the most common opportunistic pathogen following solid organ transplantation and is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Patients at highest risk for CMV disease are those who are seronegative for CMV (immunologically naive) and receive an allograft from a seropositive donor <span class=\"nowrap\">(D+/R-)</span> and those with latent CMV infection who require treatment with antilymphocyte antibodies as a part of induction therapy or for graft rejection.
