These adenomas are difficult to identify because their secretory products usually do not cause a recognizable clinical syndrome and because they often secrete so inefficiently that serum concentrations of intact gonadotropins and their subunits are often only minimally abnormal or not abnormal at all. Consequently, they are typically not detected until they become sufficiently large to cause neurologic symptoms, most often impaired vision due to pressure on the optic chiasm. Clinically nonfunctioning or &quot;silent&quot; somatotroph and corticotroph adenomas are also being identified with increasing frequency.</p><p>The treatment of gonadotroph and other clinically nonfunctioning adenomas will be reviewed here. Their clinical manifestations and diagnosis are discussed separately.

For example, an adenoma that is markedly elevating the optic chiasm is very likely to begin to cause visual abnormalities in the next few years, yet some patients will choose to wait until that occurs. Gonadotroph adenomas that are asymptomatic and not an immediate threat to vision may not require immediate surgery. (See <a href=\"#H7585601\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic adenomas'</a> below.)</p><p>Standard first-line therapy is transsphenoidal surgery. If there is no or little discernible residual adenoma tissue by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following surgery, the patient should be monitored by MRI and hormonally, initially at six-month intervals. If there is considerable residual adenomatous tissue, radiation should be administered. Long-term monitoring is necessary because the risk of tumor regrowth is significant, particularly after surgery alone. Lifelong management of pituitary hormone deficiencies is required in many patients.

Abnormalities that strongly suggest a gonadotroph adenoma are elevated basal serum concentrations of intact follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and of alpha subunit and a response of either to exogenous thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which is available only outside the United States. Approximately 20 percent of gonadotroph adenomas will exhibit one or more of these abnormalities.

The initial procedure employed a sublabial transeptal approach and an operating microscope. More recently, an endonasal endoscopic approach has been introduced and is being used increasingly. Its main advantages are better visualization of the operative site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gonadotroph-and-other-clinically-nonfunctioning-adenomas/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and less trauma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2559547\"><span class=\"h3\">Perioperative management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI on postoperative day 1 gives an initial view of how much of the adenoma has been removed, even though a more accurate view is provided when the artefacts of surgery have regressed three to six months later.

One report is a review of 35 studies that involved 1621 patients (452 with clinically nonfunctioning adenomas) treated with single-dose radiation from a linear accelerator, gamma source, or proton beam, in which the median period of observation was &lt;40 months in approximately half and &gt;40 months in approximately half [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gonadotroph-and-other-clinically-nonfunctioning-adenomas/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In the entire group of patients, adenoma size was controlled in approximately 90 percent; development of new hypopituitarism varied widely among individual reports; optic neuropathy occurred in approximately 1 percent; other cranial neuropathies occurred in approximately 1.3 percent; and parenchymal brain damage, especially in the hypothalamus and temporal lobe, occurred in approximately 0.8 percent.</p><p>In a subsequent report from a single center, 100 patients with clinically nonfunctioning adenomas were treated with single-dose radiation from a gamma source and followed for a median of 45 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gonadotroph-and-other-clinically-nonfunctioning-adenomas/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

However, data are limited, and this drug would not be considered to be an alternative for surgery. The cell membranes of some clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas have somatostatin receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gonadotroph-and-other-clinically-nonfunctioning-adenomas/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Two groups have administered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> (a somatostatin analogue) to such patients. One found improvement in visual fields in three of four patients, but no decrease in adenoma size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gonadotroph-and-other-clinically-nonfunctioning-adenomas/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The other found decreases in serum alpha subunit values in three of six patients and a reduction in tumor size and visual impairment in two each; there was, however, no correlation among the three measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gonadotroph-and-other-clinically-nonfunctioning-adenomas/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Administration of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist is the most effective approach tested thus far in suppressing FSH secretion by gonadotroph adenomas. In one report, for example, administration of Nal-Glu GnRH for one week to men with gonadotroph adenomas normalized their high serum FSH concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gonadotroph-and-other-clinically-nonfunctioning-adenomas/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In another study, serum FSH concentrations remained low for the entire six-month treatment period; however, adenoma size did not decrease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gonadotroph-and-other-clinically-nonfunctioning-adenomas/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. These results suggest that FSH secretion by gonadotroph adenomas, but not adenoma size, is dependent upon endogenous GnRH.</p><p>The rationale for the use of GnRH agonists in patients with gonadotroph adenomas is that chronic administration causes downregulation of GnRH receptors on and decreased secretion of gonadotropins from normal gonadotroph cells (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of gonadotropin-releasing hormone&quot;</a>). Unfortunately, administration of GnRH agonist analogs to patients with gonadotroph adenomas usually has either an agonist effect or no change in gonadotropin secretion and does not affect adenoma size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gonadotroph-and-other-clinically-nonfunctioning-adenomas/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1213383540\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term monitoring should include testing every 6 to 12 months initially to detect growth of residual adenoma tissue and the adequacy of hormonal replacement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1213383547\"><span class=\"h3\">Adenoma regrowth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation for tumor regrowth should include measurement of whatever serum marker was elevated before surgery and an MRI; if there is no regrowth after a year or two, the interval between scans can be lengthened. Early detection permits appropriate use of radiation therapy to minimize the need for repeat surgery. If MRI six months after transsphenoidal surgery shows little adenoma tissue or the residual tissue is not in a location of clinical significance, we recommend observation only by MRI, initially yearly.</p><p>The frequency of regrowth of residual adenoma tissue varies but is more likely when surgery is not combined with radiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gonadotroph-and-other-clinically-nonfunctioning-adenomas/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

The choice of surgical procedure, microscopic or endoscopic, depends upon the neurosurgeon's experience.

For example, an adenoma that is markedly elevating the optic chiasm is very likely to begin to cause visual abnormalities in the next few years, yet some patients will choose to wait until that occurs. These patients should be followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and visual field examinations every 6 to 12 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If little or no residual adenoma tissue remains 6 to 12 months after surgery or if a larger amount remains but does not threaten neurologic complications, we suggest monitoring the residual tissue with MRI (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If the residual tissue grows progressively, we suggest radiation therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Administration of radiation stereotactically should now be used exclusively. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For adenomas that are not causing visual symptoms, we suggest yearly monitoring of pituitary function and adenoma size (MRI).
