While the diagnosis of MVP is relatively simple (the clinical finding of a systolic click <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> murmur leads to confirmatory echocardiography), the medical literature is somewhat confusing. This is related to the overlap between denomination of MVP clinical syndromes, etiology and mechanisms, and to a change in echocardiographic diagnostic criteria for MVP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Major nonarrhythmic complications of MVP including MR, heart failure, infective endocarditis, and cerebrovascular accidents will be reviewed here. Other conditions associated with MVP are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitral-valve-prolapse-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mitral valve prolapse syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmic complications of mitral valve prolapse&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It has been estimated that the overall risk of serious complications in MVP is approximately <strong>1 percent per year</strong> in patients with clinically and echocardiographically diagnosed disease; this is a not a cumulative risk since some patients have multiple complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, patients with MVP can be divided into widely variable risk groups, with the high-risk group having a cardiovascular mortality of 3.4 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The most important risk factors for mortality are presence of moderate to severe MR and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The severity of MR also correlates with the requirement for valve replacement and the incidence of infective endocarditis, cerebral embolism, and death (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57338\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57338 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

The severity of leaflet dysfunction can progress as the abnormal leaflet tissue stretches, resulting in further prolapse and increasing regurgitation. The ventricular and atrial consequences of MR are initiated by volume overload with increased preload and left ventricular and left atrial enlargement. Impedance to ejection is reduced (due to regurgitation into the lower pressure left atrium), and therefore impaired systolic function may be masked by preservation of the left ventricular ejection fraction. Indeed, in patients with MVP and severe MR, borderline normal ejection fraction (50 to 60 percent) and increased end-systolic diameter imply overt left ventricular dysfunction. The left ventricular dysfunction is unmasked at time of surgery, with a postoperative average immediate ejection fraction drop of approximately 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natural history of chronic mitral regurgitation caused by mitral valve prolapse and flail mitral leaflet&quot;, section on 'Natural history of mitral valve prolapse'</a>.)</p><p>The majority of patients with MVP have only trace or mild MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]; hemodynamically significant MR is uncommon, occurring in only 2 to 7 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. However, the relatively high prevalence of MVP accounts for the observation that more than 25 percent of MVP surgeries are currently performed for severe MR secondary to myxomatous degeneration of the valve and subvalvular structures. Progression of MR may occur in patients with all degrees of MR at baseline but tends to be more intense in patients with pre-existent MR (as MR begets more MR). In patients with MR at baseline, the regurgitant volume increases by a mean of 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/beat</span> per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>The mechanisms of progression of MR are varied. In patients with chronic MR, with the progressive enlargement of cavities the left atrium compliance increases so that, with the same regurgitant orifice, the regurgitant volume increases as the V wave in the left atrium declines. Development of chronic progressive enlargement of the mitral annulus or new ruptured chords will tend to separate the mitral leaflets further during systole, leading to progressive increase in the regurgitant orifice. </p><p>Acute severe MR (such as occurring after chordal rupture with large unsupported segments) is poorly tolerated and usually requires rapid surgical intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21904137\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of quantification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Formal quantification of MR is endorsed by all major society guidelines (including the American College of Cardiology, European Society of Cardiology, and American Society of Echocardiography) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. Our observations that quantitative measures of MR (regurgitant volume and orifice) are essential predictors of outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] have been confirmed in two independent prospective studies totaling, with our own, more than 1000 patients followed long term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Echocardiography is the key diagnostic modality; formal quantification requires comprehensive integration of color-flow imaging and pulsed and continuous wave Doppler-echocardiography. </p><p>Quantitative assessment by continuity equation or proximal isovelocity surface area method allows measurement of effective regurgitant orifice area (ERO) and regurgitant volume (RVol); severe MR is present with ERO &gt;40 mm<sup>2</sup> and RVol &gt;60 mL. Quantitation of regurgitation severity must also take into account the highly dynamic nature of ERO with MVP. Indeed, some patients have virtually no regurgitation in the initial part of systole, with a sudden increase in ERO (sometimes to very large values) during late systole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. We have shown that patients with MVP and purely mid-late systolic MR have a more benign outcome than those with holosystolic MR. In mid-late systolic MR, regurgitant volume provides information more reflective of MR severity than ERO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Quantitative assessment of MR is evolving in parallel with development of new technologies. Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiographic techniques are increasingly used for MR quantitation (3D vena contracta area, 3D proximal isovelocity surface area [PISA], and 3D volumetric estimation of left ventricular and left atrial volumes), but their predictive value for patient outcomes remains to be established. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for quantitation of MR is now recommended when assessment by echocardiography is suboptimal or discordant with clinical findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, with the advent of percutaneous intervention on the mitral valve, numerous quantitative parameters have been proposed to assess feasibility and predict success of percutaneous mitral valve repair (mitral valve annulus and mitral valve opening areas, coaptation and leaflet length, flail gap and flail width, etc) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These are now possible with the progress in 3D echocardiography, but are time consuming, and should be reserved for patients considered for percutaneous intervention.</p><p>In addition to increasing the likelihood of valve <span class=\"nowrap\">replacement/repair,</span> presence of moderate to severe MR with MVP has been implicated as a marker for complications such as infective endocarditis, arrhythmias, and cardiovascular mortality, including sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Most of the increased risk of arrhythmias and sudden death is directly related to valvular insufficiency, although cases of sudden death have been reported in patients in whom minimal prolapse was the only abnormality found at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].

Although data are limited, small studies suggest that there is concurrent tricuspid valve prolapse in approximately 40 percent and aortic and pulmonic valve prolapse in up to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/13,14,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,26,27</a>].

One study, for example, compared patients with IE in the 1970s with those diagnosed in the 1980s: The incidence of MVP rose from 6 percent in the earlier group to 22 percent in the later group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In a systematic review of all patients undergoing surgery for native valve endocarditis at Mayo Clinic between 1984 and 2005, MVP was present in 43 percent of patients with mitral valve endocarditis and was an independent risk factor for development of endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The exact risk of developing IE in patients with MVP is difficult to determine, but estimates can be made based on the presumed incidence of IE in the general population of 1 per 20,000 per year.

This event rate was significantly increased compared with the expected rate of neurologic events in the community (relative risk 2.2, 95% CI 1.5-3.2). However, this high life-time risk of ischemic cerebral events was not uniformly distributed. The risk was non-detectable in MVP without leaflet thickening, mild for MVP with leaflet thickening under medical management, and high after either atrial fibrillation or cardiac surgery. The estimated 10-year risk of an embolic event (including events after mitral surgery) was significantly greater than the expected community event rates for patients over age 50, for those who developed atrial fibrillation, and for those with thickened mitral valve leaflets (adjusted relative risks 2.3, 5.9, and 3.5, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Other reports using current echocardiographic criteria for MVP have found no relationship between MVP and cerebral events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/9,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,41</a>].

The overall risk of serious complications of MVP is approximately 1 percent per year. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MVP is the most common etiology of primary isolated MR, accounting for over 50 percent of cases; it also accounts for over 60 percent of patients with ruptured chordae tendineae. The majority of patients have only trace or mild MR; hemodynamically significant MR is uncommon in MVP, occurring in only 2 to 7 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mitral regurgitation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to increasing the likelihood of the need for valve surgery, the presence of moderate to severe MR with MVP has been implicated as a marker for complications such as infective endocarditis, arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiovascular mortality, including sudden death. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mitral regurgitation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MR severity should be formally quantified by comprehensive echocardiography, as jet Color Doppler appearance may be misleading. Regurgitant orifice area and volume have prognostic implications. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of severe left atrial enlargement and pulmonary hypertension in patients with MR due to MVP is associated with increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infective endocarditis occurs at an increased frequency in patients with MVP when compared with those with a normal mitral valve, although the absolute risk of infection is low. Antibiotic prophylaxis is, however, no longer recommended for patients with MVP. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Infective endocarditis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The association between thromboembolic events and MVP is most likely related to the prevalence of other risk factors for embolism, including atrial fibrillation, which may be paroxysmal and asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Transient ischemic attacks and cerebral vascular accidents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> is recommended in patients with unexplained transient ischemic attacks in sinus rhythm with no atrial thrombi. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Recommendations for antithrombotic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticoagulation is recommended in patients with atrial fibrillation or systemic embolism and in those with recurrent transient ischemic attacks despite <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> therapy.
