Normal kidneys vasodilate in the presence of ischemia as part of the autoregulatory response to maintain renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Autoregulation is impaired in ATN, possibly because vascular endothelial injury reduces the release of vasodilating substances such as prostacyclin and nitric oxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-factors-that-may-influence-recovery-of-renal-function-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. As a result, recurrent ischemic tubular injury may be more likely to occur among patients treated with dialysis, thereby delaying the recovery of function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-factors-that-may-influence-recovery-of-renal-function-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>].</p><p>The modality of renal replacement therapy (RRT) may influence the likelihood of recovery because of the degree to which each modality causes hypotension. For example, fluid and solute removal is slower and hypotension is less common with peritoneal dialysis and other continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRTs) compared with intermittent hemodialysis. However, data do not conclusively support the superiority of any particular mode of RRT in adult patients with AKI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) in acute kidney injury in adults: Indications, timing, and dialysis dose&quot;, section on 'Optimal modality'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3730476840\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sepsis may further injure the kidneys and thus delay recovery. Patients who experience AKI are at high risk for infection. In one study of 618 critically ill patients, 40 percent of patients developed sepsis after developing AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-factors-that-may-influence-recovery-of-renal-function-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The reasons for increased infection risk are not known but may be related to immune dysfunction and fluid overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-factors-that-may-influence-recovery-of-renal-function-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>In addition, the provision of dialysis may be associated with an increased risk for sepsis. In the study cited above, compared with patients who had AKI but did not develop sepsis, septic patients were more likely to have been dialyzed (70 versus 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-factors-that-may-influence-recovery-of-renal-function-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The mechanism by which dialysis may increase the risk for sepsis is not known but is likely related in part to the hemodialysis catheter, which is a risk for bacteremia.

(See <a href=\"#H3048702934\" class=\"local\">'Characteristics of the dialysis membrane'</a> below.)</p><p>There may be an increase in infection-related morbidity and mortality related to subtherapeutic antibiotic serum and tissue concentrations among patients who are on dialysis and develop infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-factors-that-may-influence-recovery-of-renal-function-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-31</a>]. Subtherapeutic antibiotic concentration is due to dialytic clearance of the antibiotic or reductions in the administered dose. Ongoing changes in kidney function or volume of distribution render the appropriate dosing of antibiotics challenging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-factors-that-may-influence-recovery-of-renal-function-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3151152721\"><span class=\"h2\">Exposure to nephrotoxic medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with dialysis-requiring AKI (AKI-D) may be more susceptible to nephrotoxic injury. The increased risk is related to the administration of nephrotoxins (either drugs or contrast medium) in the setting of diminished clearance, an already injured parenchyma, and dialysis-induced volume depletion. The susceptibility to nephrotoxin injury may also be higher in older patients who are on multiple medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1899780748\"><span class=\"h2\">Method of anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several anticoagulation strategies are used during hemodialysis and CRRT, including standard and low-molecular-weight heparin, heparinoids, regional citrate anticoagulation, thrombin antagonists, and platelet inhibiting agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-anticoagulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodialysis anticoagulation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anticoagulation-for-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anticoagulation for continuous renal replacement therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The use of regional citrate anticoagulation may improve the chances of kidney recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-factors-that-may-influence-recovery-of-renal-function-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The mechanism is not known but may be via reduced inflammation.

It is possible, but has not been proven, that loss of nutrients impairs renal recovery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3048702934\"><span class=\"h2\">Characteristics of the dialysis membrane</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two variables of dialysis membranes have been suggested to affect kidney recovery. These include membrane biocompatibility and the degree to which membranes allow the back-transport from dialysate to blood of potentially harmful waterborne molecules (ie, high-flux versus low-flux membranes). These variables are discussed here.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Membrane biocompatibility </strong>&ndash; There are three types of dialyzer membranes, including cellulose, substituted cellulose, and synthetic noncellulose. Cellulose membranes (cuprophan or cuprophane) are considered bioincompatible, meaning that exposure to the membrane activates complement. Substituted cellulose and noncellulose membranes are more biocompatible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-consequences-of-hemodialysis-membrane-biocompatibility#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical consequences of hemodialysis membrane biocompatibility&quot;, section on 'Types of hemodialysis membranes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The use of biocompatible membranes may be associated with improved rates of recovery of renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-factors-that-may-influence-recovery-of-renal-function-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>], although not all studies have shown this [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-factors-that-may-influence-recovery-of-renal-function-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This is largely of historical concern since bioincompatible membranes are rarely used today (due to a reduction in cost of biocompatible membranes and due to concerns about biocompatibility). The use of biocompatible membranes has been widely adopted into contemporary practice and is recommended in the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines for AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-factors-that-may-influence-recovery-of-renal-function-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Membrane flux </strong>&ndash; Membranes can be low or high flux. High-flux membranes contain large pores that allow for enhanced permeability of larger molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-factors-that-may-influence-recovery-of-renal-function-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Although large pores can enhance removal of putative toxins, they can also allow the back-transport (from dialysate to blood) of potentially harmful waterborne substances (such as bacteria or endotoxin) or increased loss of potentially beneficial ones. The risk of contamination from water with bacteria or endotoxin is minimized, but may not be eradicated, by the use of highly purified dialysate water.

However, results have not been consistent, and other trials have not demonstrated a benefit of earlier initiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-factors-that-may-influence-recovery-of-renal-function-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>].

In a multicenter, randomized trial that compared high-intensity versus low-intensity renal replacement therapy (RRT) among critically ill patients, higher-intensity RRT was associated with higher risk of a decline in urine output (relative risk [RR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.10-1.51) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-factors-that-may-influence-recovery-of-renal-function-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. However, these differences did not associate with differences in dialysis dependence at day 28 or 60.</p><p>Both removal of excess volume and solutes retained in uremia may contribute to this response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-factors-that-may-influence-recovery-of-renal-function-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Urea may also be a surrogate marker of other substances that are removed by dialysis that stimulate urine output. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urine output and residual kidney function in kidney failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical significance of this is unclear. A patient with dialysis-requiring AKI (AKI-D) typically has few remaining functioning nephrons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-factors-that-may-influence-recovery-of-renal-function-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. The decline in urine output following dialysis likely reflects an increase in tubular reabsorption in these few nephrons. Even if the function of these nephrons became impaired (perhaps because slow flow promotes obstruction by tubular debris), an adverse impact of the fall in urine output on repair of other tubules and restoration of function in nonfunctioning nephrons has not been demonstrated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2233185958\"><span class=\"h1\">PROTECTING THE KIDNEY FROM FURTHER INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to prevent further injury to the kidney.</p><p>General measures to prevent ongoing renal injury among dialysis-requiring AKI (AKI-D) patients are the same as for critically ill patients who have nondialysis-requiring AKI.

For potentially nephrotoxic drugs that are deemed necessary, frequent therapeutic drug monitoring (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>, aminoglycosides) should be performed and the lowest effective dose utilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-factors-that-may-influence-recovery-of-renal-function-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Medication reviews should also include doses of new and pre-existing oral medications as many of these patients will continue to be treated as outpatients while awaiting recovery.</p><p>The necessity of nephrotoxic procedures (eg, iodinated contrast exposure) should be carefully evaluated. The timing of procedures should also be considered, if possible; delaying the exposure to contrast until recovery of renal function may be of benefit among patients who are considered likely to recover. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-contrast-nephropathy-associated-with-angiography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of contrast nephropathy associated with angiography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As noted above, biocompatible dialysis membranes should be used, if available.
