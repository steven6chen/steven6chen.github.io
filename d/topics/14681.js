The annual incidence of liver abscess has been estimated at 2.3 cases per 100,000 populations and is higher among men than women (3.3 versus 1.3 per 100,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]; substantially higher rates have been reported in Taiwan (17.6 cases per 100,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H795684481\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, underlying hepatobiliary or pancreatic disease, and liver transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/2,3,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,6,7</a>]. Geographic and host factors may also play a role; for example, a primary invasive liver abscess syndrome due to <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> has been described in East Asia. This is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-liver-abscess-syndrome-caused-by-klebsiella-pneumoniae\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive liver abscess syndrome caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a rare genetic disorder characterized by recurrent infections, are also at risk for liver abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic granulomatous disease: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Infections'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H795684536\"><span class=\"h2\">Association with colorectal neoplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>K. pneumoniae</em> is the primary cause of pyogenic liver abscesses in several parts of Asia, and several studies have suggested an association with underlying colorectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/9-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-14</a>]. It is unclear whether these findings can be applied to other parts of the world. </p><p>In a large retrospective analysis of claims data from the universal insurance program in Taiwan, the incidence of any subsequent gastrointestinal malignancy diagnosis among 14,690 patients who had been diagnosed with pyogenic liver abscess was fourfold higher than that among 58,760 controls matched for age, sex, and underlying diabetes mellitus (10.8 versus 2.5 cases per 1000 person years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Colorectal carcinoma was the most common malignancy in both cohorts but was more frequent among liver abscess patients (7.3 versus 1.6 cases per 1000 person years). In a separate retrospective study from Taiwan, in which 1257 patients with pyogenic liver abscess were observed to have a high risk of subsequent liver or colorectal carcinoma, the greatest excess risk of a cancer diagnosis was in the first three months after the abscess diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In most studies that evaluated causative pathogens, liver abscesses caused by <em>K. pneumoniae</em> appear to have a stronger association with colorectal cancer than those caused by other organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>], probably because most other organisms came from biliary tract diseases. The long-term follow-up prevalence of colorectal cancer among pyogenic liver abscess patients remained 2.3 to 3.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>]. Despite the limitations of these retrospective studies, the findings suggest that clinicians should consider the possibility of an occult colorectal neoplasia in patients diagnosed with pyogenic liver abscess, particularly due to <em>K. pneumoniae</em> and in the absence of apparent underlying hepatobiliary disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H795684644\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mortality rate in developed countries ranges from 2 to 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/3,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15</a>]. Independent risk factors for mortality include need for open surgical drainage, the presence of malignancy, and the presence of anaerobic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A considerable proportion of pyogenic liver abscesses follow one or more episodes of portal vein pyemia, usually related to bowel leakage and peritonitis. Another important route is direct spread from biliary infection. Underlying biliary tract disease such as gallstones or malignant obstruction is present in 40 to 60 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/2,15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15,18</a>]. Occasionally, abscesses arise from surgical or penetrating wounds, including injury from migration of an ingested foreign body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Liver abscesses may also result from hematogenous seeding from the systemic circulation. A monomicrobial liver abscess due to a streptococcal or staphylococcal species should prompt evaluation for an additional source of infection, in particular infectious endocarditis.</p><p>Liver abscesses most commonly involve the right lobe of the liver, probably because it is larger and has greater blood supply than the left and caudate lobes. Liver abscess may also be accompanied by pylephlebitis (infective suppurative thrombosis of the portal vein) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pylephlebitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pylephlebitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many pathogens have been described; this variability reflects the different causes, types of medical intervention (such as biliary tree stenting, or immunosuppression due to cancer chemotherapy) and geographic differences. Most pyogenic liver abscesses are polymicrobial; mixed enteric facultative and anaerobic species are the most common pathogens. Anaerobes are probably under-reported because they are difficult to culture and characterize in the laboratory. For example, in one series of 233 cases, mixed facultative and anaerobic species were implicated in one-third of patients, and bacteremia was documented in 56 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The highly variable microbiology justifies pursuing a microbiological diagnosis in virtually every case. Potential pathogens include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <em>Streptococcus milleri</em> group (including <em>Streptococcus anginosus</em>, <em>Streptococcus constellatus</em>, and <em>Streptococcus intermedius</em>) is an important cause of liver abscess. When implicated, it should prompt a search for simultaneous metastatic infections at other locations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infections-due-to-the-streptococcus-anginosus-streptococcus-milleri-group\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infections due to the Streptococcus anginosus (Streptococcus milleri) group&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>, and other gram-positive cocci are recognized pathogens in specific circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. For example, in a report of liver abscesses in patients who underwent transarterial embolization for hepatocellular carcinoma, they accounted for 60 percent of pathogens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsurgical-therapies-for-localized-hepatocellular-carcinoma-transarterial-embolization-radiotherapy-and-radioembolization#H1248650342\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonsurgical therapies for localized hepatocellular carcinoma: Transarterial embolization, radiotherapy, and radioembolization&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Candida species have also been implicated in pyogenic liver abscess and accounted for 22 percent of liver abscesses in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Hepatosplenic candidiasis can occur in patients who have received chemotherapy and presents during recovery of neutrophil counts following a neutropenic episode.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extraintestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extraintestinal Entamoeba histolytica amebiasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical clinical manifestations of pyogenic liver abscess are fever and abdominal pain. Other common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, and malaise.</p><p>Fever occurs in approximately 90 percent of patients, and abdominal symptoms occur in 50 to 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/2,3,15,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,15,25</a>]. Abdominal symptoms and signs are usually localized to the right upper quadrant and may include pain, guarding, rocking tenderness (pain caused by gently rocking the patient's abdomen), and even rebound tenderness. About one-half of patients with liver abscess have hepatomegaly, right upper quadrant tenderness, or jaundice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The absence of right upper quadrant findings does not exclude liver abscess.</p><p>Abscess rupture is a rare complication, occurring in 3.8 percent of 602 patients in one series from Korea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Abscess diameter &gt;6 cm and coexisting cirrhosis were the main risk factors for rupture, with most ruptures being perihepatic or into the pleural space.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of pyogenic liver abscess is made by history, clinical examination, and radiographic imaging followed by aspiration and culture of the abscess material.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound are the diagnostic modalities of choice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F61510\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61510 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. CT usually shows a fluid collection with surrounding edema. There may also be stranding and loculated subcollections. Pyogenic liver abscess cannot be reliably distinguished from amebic abscess by imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extraintestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extraintestinal Entamoeba histolytica amebiasis&quot;, section on 'Amebic liver abscess'</a>.)</p><p>Abscesses must be distinguished from tumors and cysts. Tumors have a solid radiographic appearance and may contain areas of calcification. Necrosis and bleeding within a tumor may lead to a fluid-filled appearance; in such circumstances radiographic differentiation from abscess can be challenging. Cysts appear as fluid collections without surrounding stranding or hyperemia.</p><p>An elevated right hemidiaphragm, right basilar infiltrate, or right-sided pleural effusion can be seen on chest radiograph in 25 to 35 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]; these findings should prompt further investigation of the right upper quadrant with CT or ultrasonography. Magnetic resonance imaging and tagged white blood cell scans are less useful for distinguishing abscess from other causes of liver mass.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Microbial cultures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Material obtained from CT or ultrasound-guided aspiration should be sent to the laboratory for Gram stain and culture (both aerobic and anaerobic). Anaerobic culture should be specifically requested on the laboratory requisition.</p><p>Blood cultures are essential; they are positive in up to 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Cultures obtained from existing drains are <strong>not</strong> sufficiently reliable for guiding antimicrobial therapy, since they are often contaminated with skin flora and other organisms. This was demonstrated in a study of 66 cases of liver abscess; cultures results obtained via radiographic guidance were compared with culture results obtained from a drain that had been in place for at least 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Cultures from percutaneous specimens correlated with cultures from drainage catheters in only one-half of cases.

The approach depends on the size and number of abscesses. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Single abscesses with a diameter &le;5 cm</strong> &mdash; Either percutaneous catheter drainage or needle aspiration is acceptable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. Drainage catheters should remain in place until drainage is minimal (usually up to seven days). Repeat needle aspiration may be required in up to half of cases if a catheter is not left in situ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Single abscesses with diameter &gt;5 cm</strong> &mdash; For percutaneous management, catheter drainage is preferred over needle aspiration. This approach is supported by the results of a trial of 60 patients with pyogenic liver abscess treated with antibiotics and percutaneous drainage via catheter or needle aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Successful outcomes were observed for all patients with abscess &le;5 cm, regardless of drainage modality. However, among patients with an abscess diameter &gt;5 cm, treatment was successful in 100 percent of patients treated with catheter drainage compared with 50 percent of patients with needle aspiration. Even very large abscesses (&gt;10 cm) can be successfully managed with catheter drainage, although the risk of treatment failure and other complications is substantial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/3,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,33</a>]. In a single-center study from Singapore that included 44 pyogenic liver abscesses &gt;10 cm in diameter, 39 were treated with percutaneous drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Of those, 25 percent experienced a complication, including death from sepsis, pleural effusion requiring drainage, and need for repeat percutaneous drainage. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, some studies have suggested that abscess size &gt;5 cm is associated with failure of percutaneous drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In one retrospective study of 80 patients with abscess &gt;5 cm, the rate of treatment failure was lower with surgical drainage (7 versus 28 percent), but there were no differences in mortality, morbidity, duration of fever, or complication rates with percutaneous versus surgical drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p/><p>Surgical drainage is usually preferred in the following circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple abscesses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loculated abscesses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abscesses with viscous contents obstructing the drainage catheter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Underlying disease requiring primary surgical management</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate response to percutaneous drainage within seven days</p><p/><p>In some specific cases, multiple or loculated abscesses may be successfully managed by percutaneous drainage, particularly when the abscesses are small and easily accessible percutaneously. This was illustrated in one retrospective study that described successful percutaneous drainage in the setting of multiple abscesses (22 of 24 patients) and multiloculated abscesses (51 of 54 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>However, it is difficult to make general recommendations about a surgical versus percutaneous approach in these circumstances. The decision will usually be made on an individual basis by a multidisciplinary team taking into account the number, size, and accessibility of the abscess; the experience of the surgeons and radiologists; and especially the underlying condition and co-morbidities of the patient.</p><p>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can be useful for drainage of liver abscesses in patients with previous biliary procedures whose infection communicates with the biliary tree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/18,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No randomized controlled trials have evaluated empiric antibiotic regimens for treatment of pyogenic liver abscess. Treatment recommendations are based upon the probable source of infection and should be guided by local bacterial resistance patterns, if known. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Empiric broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics should be administered pending abscess Gram stain and culture results. We suggest one of the regimens outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67894\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67894 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Regardless of the initial empiric regimen, the therapeutic regimen should be revisited once culture and susceptibility results are available. Recovery of more than one organism should suggest polymicrobial infection including anaerobes, even if no anaerobes are isolated in culture. In such circumstances, anaerobic coverage should be continued.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized controlled trials evaluating the optimal duration of therapy.

Patients with abscess(es) that are difficult to drain usually require longer courses of therapy.</p><p>Useful clinical indicators to follow are pain, temperature, white blood cell count, and serum C-reactive protein. Follow-up imaging should only be performed in the setting of persistent clinical symptoms or if drainage is not proceeding as expected; radiological abnormalities resolve much more slowly than clinical and biochemical markers. Among 102 pyogenic liver abscess patients in Nepal, the mean time to ultrasonographic resolution of abscesses &lt;10 cm was 16 weeks; mean time to resolution for abscesses &gt;10 cm was 22 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyogenic-liver-abscess/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Drainage catheters should remain in place until drainage is minimal (usually up to seven days).
