The illness was first described in northern Australia in 1928 and subsequently has been observed widely through Australia and many islands of the western South Pacific. It is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in Australia. The virus can be transmitted by many mosquito species and survives in mosquito eggs in arid environments. Therefore, it has the capacity to spread to other geographic areas.</p><p>Other viruses that cause arthritis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific viruses that cause arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ross River virus (RRV) infection has been described in mainland Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], Papua New Guinea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], the Solomon Islands, the islands of eastern Indonesia, the western South Pacific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>], Fiji [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and American Samoa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As many as 500,000 people were infected in Fiji when the disease first appeared in 1979 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Outbreaks have been described in American Samoa, New Caledonia, French Polynesia, the Cook Islands, and most states of Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Over 30 percent of blood donors in French Polynesia are seropositive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In Australia, six to seven thousand people are infected annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The highest rates of infection have been reported from the Northern Territory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Endemic foci also occur in more temperate eastern Australia. Infection has been observed in the outskirts of Sydney since 1997 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Between 2006 and 2009, increasing modifications were noted from the Perth metropolitan area in off-seasons (June to September) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Epidemics have increased in frequency, size, and range throughout European settlements of Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The geographic range is expanding in Queensland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and South Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In Queensland, areas adjacent to Townsville, on the eastern coast, and southeast Queensland, especially in summer and autumn, are particularly affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>RRV infection occurs most frequently in tropical coastal regions with salt marsh habitats suitable for the principal mosquito vector species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The infection is most common in spring, after summer rains, or following inundation of salt marshes by rain or tides. The virus persists in arid areas of inland Australia within desiccation-resistant mosquito eggs. Outbreaks occur after rain, when mosquitoes hatch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Climate influences disease activity. Models predicting disease activity differ among regions; the relationships between climate, social, and environmental factors are complex. In the River Murray Valley in Southern Australia, important factors include river height, rainfall, and mosquito abundance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Flooding is significantly associated with transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In a Tasmanian study, a combination of high spring tides and excessive summer rainfall produced a salt marsh habitat with a high density of mosquitoes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Isolation of RRV from these mosquitoes coincided with the onset of the first human cases of RRV infection. In Western Australia, climate data were moderately sensitive in predicting epidemics (64 percent); the addition of mosquito surveillance data improved sensitivity of an early warning model for epidemics (90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Dryland salinity, a substantial and expanding problem in the wheat belt of Southwestern Australia, is associated with an abundance of <em>Aedes camptorhynchus</em> and increased potential for zoonotic transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], although increased human seroprevalence has not yet been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Important factors for infection in the Darwin region of tropical Northern Australia include rainfall, minimum temperature, and abundance of three mosquito species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The relative importance of these environmental factors differs according to region, although rainfall is consistently associated with increased disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>Travelers to affected areas of Australia have presented with illness on returning home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Ross River virus is also transmissible by blood transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Vectors and hosts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mosquito species that serve as vectors for RRV vary by region. In coastal Australia, <em>Aedes vigilax</em> (salt marsh mosquito) and <em>Ae. camptorhynchus</em> are major vectors; both of these species feed during the day. In inland areas except Tasmania, <em>Culex annulirostris</em> predominates; this species feeds at night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Other species capable of transmitting RRV include <em>Aedes tremulus</em>, <em>Aedes polynesiensis</em>, <em>Aedes aegypti</em>, <em>Culex gelidus</em>, and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. <em>A. aegypti</em> has the potential to considerably extend the distribution of this infection.</p><p>Native macropods (eg, kangaroos and wallabies) are the principal vertebrate hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In southwest Western Australia, over 40 percent of western grey kangaroos have neutralizing antibodies to RRV and are believed to have a role in maintenance and transmission of RRV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Infection also occurs among other wild animals and livestock. Possums and horses are potential reservoirs in urban areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In addition, vertical transmission occurs in mosquitoes, and human-mosquito-human transmission is believed to occur. Studies of RRV in northwest Victoria suggest that the density of short-lived, highly fecund hosts, such as mice, may also influence rural disease transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Humans and possums appear to contribute most to epidemic transmission, followed by macropods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20298956\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ross River virus (RRV) is an enveloped RNA virus; distinct genetic types have been found in eastern and western Australia, with a mix in northern Australia. The membrane bilayer, which surrounds the nucleocapsid, is penetrated by spikes, each of which consists of glycoproteins E1 and E2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. E2 is thought to be involved in recognition of the cellular receptor in the host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Relapse or persistence of symptoms in many patients may be related to persistent replication within synovial macrophages despite neutralizing antibodies and antiviral cytokine responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. This process may be initiated by an initial immunoglobulin (Ig)G anti-RRV antibody response, which enhances infection in macrophages and monocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Functional polymorphisms in immune-response genes contribute to individual susceptibility and outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Polymorphisms in the interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-10 loci influence cytokine production and the severity and duration of illness after infection with RRV. These risk-associated cytokine genotypes may act in combination to potentiate their impact on illness severity. IL-10 is a potent inhibitor of IL-1-beta and TNF-alpha production by macrophages, and these cytokines often have synergistic activities in induction of inflammation in the acute sickness response. In vitro models suggest that cellular antiviral response can direct selective pressure for viral sequence evolution that impacts on viral fitness and sensitivity to <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha/beta</span> interferon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>The arthritis of RRV infection is believed to be mediated by local cell-mediated immune responses. In the majority of patients, inflammation is present in the absence of detectable virus, although RRV DNA has been identified in the inflamed synovium of some patients more than a month after the onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>The rash of RRV infection may be a manifestation of a cell-mediated immune response to viral antigen in the basal epidermal and eccrine duct epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Circulating immune complexes have not been found in patients with persistent symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In a mouse model, macrophages have been shown to be the primary mediators of muscle damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>In patients with prolonged arthralgia and a long convalescent course, increased proinflammatory cytokine levels have been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ross River virus (RRV) infection has been observed in individuals between 4 and 85 years of age; the disease occurs slightly more commonly in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The incubation period for acute presentations is usually 3 to 9 days but may be as long as 21 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Subclinical infection is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Symptomatic RRV infection presents in one of the three ways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute febrile illness with arthritis and rash</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute fever, rash, or arthritis alone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic polyarthritis or polyarthralgia</p><p/><p>There are no laboratory findings specific for RRV infection. The leukocyte count is usually normal; atypical lymphocytes or a mild neutrophilia may be found in some patients. The serum C-reactive protein concentration is usually normal, but modest elevations in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be observed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most dramatic clinical features of RRV infection are marked arthralgia and myalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Joint pains are present in more than 95 percent of patients. True arthritis occurs in 40 percent of patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57212\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57212 \">picture 1</a>). The joints of the extremities are most frequently involved, especially the wrists, knees, ankles, and the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints of the fingers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72125\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72125 \">picture 2</a>). Joint involvement is usually symmetric, but the severity of inflammation may be asymmetric. The intensity of the pain and inflammation may resemble that of gout. Effusions are often present in joints and tendon sheaths, and Achilles tendinitis and plantar fasciitis may occur. Back pain is also common; no association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 and another HLA allele has been detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Synovial fluid analysis early in the disease may suggest viral arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The fluid is viscous with entirely or predominantly mononuclear cells; neutrophils may comprise up to 12 percent of cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Rash and fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rash and fever are observed in approximately one-half of patients with RRV infection. Rash and arthritis usually develop within two days of one another but may be separated by up to two weeks. The rash may occur before or after the arthritis. It is typically short lived (1 to 10 days) but may persist for several months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The palms, soles of the feet, face, and mucous membranes of the mouth may be involved. The rash usually consists of 1 to 5 mm maculopapular lesions on the limbs and trunk; it is often sparse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75678\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75678 \">picture 3</a>), although in some cases it is dense and can include purpuric areas or small vesicles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77070\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77070 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Fever, occasionally reaching 39&ordm;C, is present early in RRV infection in about 20 percent of patients and usually resolves within three days. Chills and delirium can occur; rigors are unusual.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Other clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatigue is the most frequent constitutional symptom, occurring in 90 percent of patients. It may be prominent, even in the absence of fever, and may persist after other symptoms resolve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Anorexia and headache (50 percent patients) are common. Other symptoms and signs include diarrhea, neck stiffness, photophobia, splenomegaly, aseptic meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>], hematuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and superficial lymphadenopathy (usually mild; occasionally tender). Several patients with encephalitis have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>]; one case of fatal encephalitis has been attributed to RRV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. RRV has not been associated with congenital abnormalities, although transplacental viral transmission was described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20298775\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The average duration of symptoms differs considerably in different reports. Some arthralgias persist for more than three months in two-thirds of patients, but it usually steadily diminishes in severity over this time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/36,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,62</a>]. In one study, for example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use decreased from 63 percent at one month to 15 percent at three months. Early studies suggested patients can have persistent arthralgia, myalgia, and fatigue for more than a year after infection; more recent evidence suggests that symptoms usually resolve within three to six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/19,63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,63,64</a>]. Many patients with longer duration of symptoms had other underlying comorbidities such as rheumatic disease or depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Degenerative joint changes do not occur, and relapses are infrequent.</p><p>In a prospective cohort study of patients with RRV, Epstein Barr virus, or Q fever infection, 12 percent of patients had prolonged illness with disabling fatigue, musculoskeletal pains, neurocognitive difficulties, and mood disturbance at six months following initial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The outcome was predicted by severity of acute illness rather than the underlying microbiologic diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ross River virus (RRV) infection should be suspected in the setting of acute polyarthritis and rash with a history of travel or residence in endemic or epidemic areas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis includes rubella, infectious mononucleosis, parvovirus B19, immunoglobulin A vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura), serum sickness, a drug reaction, erythema multiforme, and systemic lupus erythematosus. It also includes other arboviral infections, particularly Barmah Forest virus infection and chikungunya fever. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chikungunya-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chikungunya fever&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Barmah Forest virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Barmah Forest virus (BFV) is an alphavirus transmitted by mosquitoes that causes polyarthritis. BFV causes approximately 10 percent of epidemic polyarthritis in northeastern Australia. It was first recognized as a cause of human infection in 1988 and has been increasingly reported in Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Epidemics have been recognized in the Northern Territory (1992), Western Australia (1992 to 1993) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>], coastal New South Wales (1995), Victoria (2002) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>], and Queensland (2002 to 2003) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Transmission of BFV is determined by a number of environmental factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Peak transmission occurs in summer and autumn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Endemic activity is believed to be restricted to northern Australia. Exotic vector mosquitoes involved in past epidemics include <em>Ae. camptorhynchus</em> (1993), <em>Ae. vigilax</em> (1995), and <em>Ochlerotatus camptorhynchus</em> (2002). High rates of infection among brushtail possums suggest they may play a role in transmission of urban human infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations of BFV are similar to those of RRV although, in general, BFV tends to cause milder disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Rash is more common with BFV infection, while arthritis is more prominent in RRV infection, although these diseases cannot be reliably distinguished based on symptoms alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/63,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,72</a>]. In one series of 84 patients with BFV, the most common symptoms and signs were lethargy (89 percent), joint pain (82 percent), and rash (68 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Dermatologic manifestations include urticated erythema and widespread vesiculopapular, macular, or purpuric eruptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>Diagnosis of BFV is confirmed by a virus-specific IgM response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of RRV infection is generally established by serology; the most common serologic methods are the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody test and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. A fourfold rise in HI titer is diagnostic; levels of &ge;1:1280 indicate recent infection. RRV-specific IgM persists for months after acute infection. Thus, acute infection should be confirmed by rising IgM titers if patients live in endemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Testing for a specific IgA response can demonstrate acute infection in patients with persistent high levels of anti-IgM and IgG antibodies, although this test is rarely necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>Viral culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are less widely used diagnostic tools. RRV can be isolated from blood drawn early in the course of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ross-river-virus-infection/abstract/19,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,52</a>]. RRV has not been cultured from joint fluid, but viral antigen has been detected by immunofluorescence in joint fluid specimens collected early in the disease.

In contrast, camping increased the risk of Ross River virus (RRV) eightfold. Screens should be fitted to windows and doors in high-risk areas.

The illness was first described in northern Australia and subsequently has been observed widely throughout Australia and many islands of the western South Pacific. It is common in the tropical coastal regions of northern Australia. RRV can be transmitted by a variety of mosquito species, including <em>Aedes vigilax</em>, <em>Aedes camptorhynchus</em>, and <em>Culex annulirostris</em>. Kangaroos and wallabies are the principal vertebrate hosts. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic RRV infection typically presents as acute illness with fever, arthritis, and rash. These symptoms frequently occur together but may occur in isolation. Arthritis in the wrists, knees, ankles, and finger joints is common and frequently symmetric. The rash is usually maculopapular and involves the limbs and trunk. Arthralgia may persist for up to three months. Fatigue is the most frequent constitutional symptom. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of RRV infection is generally established by serology; the most common serologic methods are the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. A fourfold rise in HI titer is diagnostic; levels of &ge;1:1280 indicate recent infection. RRV-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)M persists for months after acute infection, and acute infection can be confirmed by rising IgM titers. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment consists of supportive care, analgesics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. (See <a href=\"#H20298699\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most important preventive measure is avoidance of mosquito bites. Helpful interventions include use of window and door screens, mosquito repellants, and light-colored clothing. Over the long term, drainage of mosquito breeding areas in endemic areas may be helpful to control infection.
