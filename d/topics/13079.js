Three major categories are based upon pathogenic mechanisms of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteomyelitis secondary to a contiguous focus of infection (eg, after trauma, surgery, or insertion of a prosthetic joint).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteomyelitis secondary to a contiguous focus of infection associated with vascular insufficiency, primarily occurring in patients with diabetes mellitus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peripheral vascular disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteomyelitis following hematogenous spread of infection, which is the major mechanism in vertebral osteomyelitis and in children. It was previously thought that spread of infection may occur via vertebral veins known as Batson's plexus, especially from sites of infection in bowel or urinary tract. Seeding beneath the vertebral endplate is followed by involvement of the disc and other adjoining vertebrae. Blood vessels in pediatric spine terminate within the intervertebral disc, allowing for direct extension of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Many experts now believe that the corkscrewing of the vertebral arterial supply leads to vertebral osteomyelitis in patients with bacteremia.</p><p/><p>Acute osteomyelitis evolves over several days to weeks and can progress to a chronic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The hallmark of chronic osteomyelitis is the presence of dead bone (sequestrum). Other common features of chronic osteomyelitis include involucrum (reactive bony encasement of the sequestrum), local bone loss, and, if there is extension through cortical bone, sinus tracts.</p><p>The pathogenesis and pathology of acute and chronic osteomyelitis will be reviewed here. The diagnosis and treatment of osteomyelitis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of osteomyelitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to imaging modalities in the setting of suspected osteomyelitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of osteomyelitis following trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of diabetic infections of the lower extremities&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vertebral osteomyelitis and discitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal bone is highly resistant to infection. Thus, osteomyelitis arises only when there is a large organism inoculation, trauma leading to bone damage, or the presence of foreign material. The pathogenesis of osteomyelitis is multifactorial and poorly understood. Some important factors include virulence of the infecting organism(s), underlying immune status of the host, and the type, location, and vascularity of the bone.</p><p>Bacteria have a variety of virulence determinants that can contribute to the development of osteomyelitis in the appropriate clinical setting. <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, the most common cause of osteomyelitis, has been extensively used as a model to study pathogenesis. It is an important cause of both hematogenous and contiguous focus osteomyelitis and produces a number of extracellular and cell-associated factors that may contribute to virulence by promoting bacterial adherence, resistance to host defense mechanisms, and proteolytic activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacterial adherence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adherence appears to play a central role in the early stages of <em>S. aureus</em>&ndash;induced osteomyelitis or arthritis. <em>S. aureus</em> adheres to a number of components of bone matrix including fibrinogen, fibronectin, laminin, collagen, bone sialoglycoprotein, and clumping factor A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. Adherence is mediated by expression of specific adhesins, called microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>].</p><p>The potential importance of adhesins was illustrated in a study in which mice were inoculated with positive and negative mutants for the collagen adhesin gene: septic arthritis occurred with greater frequency in the mutant-positive compared with mutant-negative strains (&gt;70 percent versus 27 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The adhesin-positive strains were also associated with the production of high levels of immunoglobulin G and interleukin 6. In other experimental studies, <em>S. aureus</em> adhesion was blocked by antibodies directed against the collagen receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It has been speculated that bone and other invasive <em>S. aureus</em> infections might be prevented by an adhesin-derived vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Collagen-binding adhesin (CNA) of <em>S. aureus</em> is a virulence factor for arthritis in several animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The expression of CNA permits the attachment of pathogen to cartilage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. How CNA contributes to virulence and whether it is important in humans are unclear.</p><p>Fibronectin-binding protein rapidly coats implanted foreign bodies in vivo and adheres to biomaterials coated with host proteins. It may be particularly important in infections associated with prosthetic joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Atomic-force microscopy has demonstrated that fibronectin-binding proteins A and B (FnBPA and FnBPB) form bonds with host fibronectin and may play a key role in binding <em>S. aureus</em> to implants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prosthetic joint infection: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Proteolytic activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential proteolytic activity present in normal joints is inhibited in the absence of infection. However, this protective effect may be lost with infection. In an in vitro model of adult chondrocytes inoculated with <em>S. aureus</em>, for example, overall protein synthesis was reduced by 84 percent, with an increase in the release of collagenase and gelatinase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Resistance to host defense</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ability of microorganisms to resist host defense mechanisms at both the cellular and matrix levels presents difficulties in the treatment of osteomyelitis.</p><p><em>S. aureus</em> can survive intracellularly in cultured osteoblasts. Persistence of intracellular pathogens within osteoblasts may also be an important factor in the pathogenesis of osteomyelitis. When digested by osteoblasts, <em>S. aureus </em>undergoes phenotypic alteration, which renders it more resistant to the action of antimicrobials. This may explain in part the high relapse rate of osteomyelitis treated with antimicrobials for a short duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Osteoblast persistence of <em>S. aureus</em> in chronic osteomyelitis has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Arachidonic acid metabolites, such as prostaglandin E2, a strong osteoclast agonist, decrease the bacterial inoculum needed to produce infection.</p><p><em>S. aureus</em> expresses a 42-kDa protein, protein A, which is bound covalently to the outer peptidoglycan layer of their cell walls. Protein A binds to the Fc portion of IgG on polymorphonuclear leukocytes, interfering with opsonization and phagocytosis of <em>S. aureus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Loss of protein A activity reduces virulence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p><em>S. aureus </em>secretes two toxins, exotoxin and toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST-) 1, which exert important effects on the immune system when administered parenterally. The toxins act as superantigens and suppress plasma cell differentiation; they also stimulate production of cytokines, such as interleukin 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Animals infected with strains of <em>S. aureus</em> isogenic for TSST-1 develop frequent and severe arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Staphylococcal enterotoxin and TSST-1 subvert the cellular and humoral immune system, which may determine whether a local infection is eliminated or develops into osteomyelitis or septic arthritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute osteomyelitis demonstrates suppurative infection with acute inflammatory cells, accompanied by edema, vascular congestion, and small vessel thrombosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72714\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72714 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62981\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62981 \">picture 2</a>). In early acute disease, the vascular supply to the bone is compromised by infection extending into the surrounding soft tissue. When both the medullary and periosteal blood supplies are compromised, large areas of dead bone (sequestra) may form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Within this necrotic and ischemic tissue, bacteria can be difficult to eradicate even in the setting of an intense host response, surgery, and antibiotic therapy.</p><p>Clinically and histologically, acute osteomyelitis blends into chronic osteomyelitis. Pathologic features of chronic osteomyelitis include necrotic bone, the formation of new bone, and polymorphonuclear leukocyte exudation joined by large numbers of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and occasional plasma cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53767\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53767 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p>Necrosis of normal tissue is an important feature of osteomyelitis. Dead bone is absorbed by the action of granulation tissue developing at its surface. Absorption takes place earliest and most rapidly at the junction of living and necrotic bone. If the area of the dead bone is small, it is entirely destroyed by granulation tissue, leaving a cavity behind. The necrotic cancellous (trabecular) bone in localized osteomyelitis, even though extensive, is usually absorbed. Some of the dead cortical bone is gradually detached from living bone to form a sequestrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>Host defense and mesenchymal cells, mainly the polymorphonuclear leukocytes, macrophages, and the osteoclasts, elaborate proteolytic enzymes that break down organic elements in the dead bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62981\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62981 \">picture 2</a>). Because of lost blood supply, dead bone appears whiter than living bone. Cancellous bone is absorbed rapidly and may be completely sequestrated or destroyed in two to three weeks, but necrotic cortex may require two weeks to six months for separation. After complete separation, the dead bone is slowly eroded by granulation tissue and absorbed.</p><p>New bone formation is another characteristic feature of osteomyelitis. New bone forms from the surviving fragments of periosteum, endosteum, and the cortex in the region of the infection and is produced by a vascular reaction to the infection. New bone may be formed along the intact periosteal and endosteal surfaces and may also arise when the periosteum forms an encasing sheath of live bone (involucrum) surrounding the dead bone. Involucrum is irregular and is often perforated by openings through which pus may track into the surrounding soft tissues and eventually to the skin surfaces through a sinus tract. The involucrum can gradually increase in density and thickness to form part or all of a new shaft.</p><p>New bone increases in amount and density for weeks or months, according to the size of the bone and the extent and duration of infection. Endosteal new bone may proliferate and obstruct the medullary canal. After host defense removal or surgical removal of the sequestrum, the body, especially in children, may fill the remaining cavity with new bone. However, in adults, the cavity may persist or the space may be filled with fibrous tissue that may connect with the skin surface via a sinus tract.</p><p>The surviving bone in the osteomyelitis field usually becomes osteoporotic during the active period of infection. Osteoporosis is the result of the inflammatory reaction and atrophy disuse. After the infection subsides, bone density increases partially from reuse (eg, of a limb); the bone may undergo extensive transformation to conform to areas of new mechanical stresses. It may be difficult to distinguish between the old living bone and the newly formed bone as time passes. All traces of osteomyelitis can disappear in children and, to a lesser extent, in adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Differences by age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are basic differences in the pathology of osteomyelitis in infants, children, and adults.</p><p>In neonates, small capillaries cross the epiphyseal growth plate and permit extension of infection into the epiphysis and joint space. The cortical bone of the neonate and infant is thin and loose, consisting predominantly of woven bone, which permits escape of the pressure caused by infection, but promotes rapid spread of the infection directly into the subperiosteal region. A large sequestrum is not produced because extensive infarction of the cortex does not occur; however, a large subperiosteal abscess can form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>In children older than one year, infection presumably starts in the metaphyseal sinusoidal veins and is contained by the growth plate. Dye injection experiments described in the 1920s have depicted metaphyseal vessels as a series of capillary loops terminating adjacent to the growth plate and expanding into dilated venous sinusoids resulting in sluggish blood flow, thus predisposing to bacterial deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Subsequently, electron micrographic studies have described rapidly growing vessels with a single layer of discontinuous endothelium at their tips, through which bacteria may pass during an episode of bacteremia, thus initiating osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. An experimental avian model confirmed that bacteria are deposited initially at the end of metaphyseal tunnels that provide a framework for the rapidly growing metaphyseal vessels. The presence of endothelial gaps in the tips of metaphyseal vessels, regardless of blood flow rates, may play a critical role in the initiation of staphylococcal osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The joint is spared unless the metaphysis is intracapsular. The infection spreads laterally where it breaks through the cortex and lifts the loose periosteum to form a subperiosteal abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/30,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,35</a>].</p><p>In adults, the growth plate has resorbed, and the infection may again extend to the joint spaces as in infants. In addition, the periosteum is firmly attached to the underlying bone; as a result, subperiosteal abscess formation and intense periosteal proliferation are less frequently seen. The infection can erode through the periosteum, forming a draining sinus tract(s) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18562386\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hallmark of chronic osteomyelitis is the presence of dead bone (sequestrum).
