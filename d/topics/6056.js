This topic review will focus on the role of the endoscopist in the management of these disorders. It is important to appreciate that several injuries, particularly complex hilar lesions or total transections, are usually not amenable to endoscopic treatment. An overview of the complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE AND DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and its sudden and widespread implementation in the early 1990s led to a dramatic increase in the frequency of biliary injury. With increasing experience, the incidence of this complication has declined substantially (from 2.2 percent in a report from 1991 to an overall incidence of 0.6 percent from several more recent series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>However, the incidence has probably reached a plateau. This was illustrated in a report from a high-volume tertiary referral center, in which the frequency and distribution of bile duct injuries detected by ERCP over a nine-year period (from 1994 to 2003) remained unchanged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The actual incidence of biliary injuries may be higher than the above estimates since not all series classified bile leaks that did not require operative management as a complication.</p><p>Successful management of bile duct injury requires a multidisciplinary team approach incorporating experienced biliary endoscopists, interventional radiologists, and hepatobiliary surgeons. The approach to the patient depends upon the nature and extent of the injury, the presence or absence of biloma, and the timing of discovery. Debate continues within the surgical literature as to whether routine intraoperative cholangiography reduces the risk of biliary complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>A general classification of biliary injuries has been proposed although it is not universally accepted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66356\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66356 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For the endoscopist, post cholecystectomy biliary tract injuries can be broadly divided into two groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bile leak without significant ductal injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major ductal injury with or without bile leak</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BILE LEAK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minor and clinically insignificant or inapparent bile leaks are common after cholecystectomy. They generally result from ducts in the gallbladder bed (called &quot;subvesical&quot; ducts) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Routine postoperative ultrasonography will detect small collections within the gallbladder bed in up to 24 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The majority of these resolve without intervention or adverse sequelae.</p><p>Significant postoperative bile leaks occur in approximately 0.8 to 1.1 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Technical problems or intraoperative complications have been reported in up to 50 percent of patients who subsequently develop a biliary tract fistula or injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with bile leaks usually present within the first postoperative week, although presentation may be delayed for up to 30 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As mentioned above, minor bile duct leaks, such as those coming from the end of the cystic duct stump or from a duct of Luschka, are associated with low output through a surgical drain and usually resolve without intervention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F91641\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91641 \">image 1</a>). In contrast, the presence of a significant bile leak is heralded by a persistent bile discharge from an operatively placed drain or T-tube tract, or symptoms of pain and fever in association with varying degrees of abdominal distension, ileus, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> jaundice.</p><p>The diagnosis can usually be confirmed with an ultrasound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F91310\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91310 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, negative imaging (both ultrasonography and computed tomography) does not preclude the possibility of a clinically significant leak. Cholescintigraphy using 99mTc-hepatic iminodiacetic acid (HIDA scan) may also be useful in establishing the diagnosis of a bile leak when ultrasound <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> computed tomography (CT) are equivocal. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) can also detect a bile leak, but these tests do not offer therapeutic capability, unlike endoscopic cholangiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. If symptoms continue and the clinical suspicion for a bile leak is strong, endoscopic cholangiography should be performed.</p><p>Endoscopic cholangiography can delineate the site of the leak in over 95 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Furthermore, it can detect the presence of stones, strictures, and the location of a T-tube (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77959%7EGAST%2F66681%7EGAST%2F67568\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77959 graphicRef66681 graphicRef67568 \">image 3A-C</a>).</p><p>Bile leaks can be classified into two groups based upon their cholangiographic magnitude:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High grade leaks demonstrate rapid extravasation of contrast from the biliary tree upon initial injection, at which time negligible intrahepatic filling has occurred (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58317%7EGAST%2F70108\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58317 graphicRef70108 \">image 4A-B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low grade leaks require complete or near complete intrahepatic filling to demonstrate contrast extravasation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72621\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72621 \">image 5</a>).</p><p/><p>The table summarizes clinical and cholangiographic data from large series of patients (n &gt;50) with postcholecystectomy bile leaks managed endoscopically (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71758\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71758 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/12,16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16-20</a>]. The early reports include patients from the open cholecystectomy era. The cystic duct remnant was the site of bile extravasation in approximately three quarters of patients, while ducts within the gallbladder bed were the source in 6 to 17 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80167\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80167 \">image 6</a>) and common bile duct, common hepatic duct, and T-tube tracts accounted for the remainder. Cystic duct leaks occur due to varying combinations of clip dysfunction or misplacement and necrosis or tearing of the cystic duct remnant proximal to the clip. Retained common bile duct stones were detected in 20 to 25 percent of patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of endoscopic therapy is to eliminate the transpapillary pressure gradient, thereby permitting preferential transpapillary bile flow rather than extravasation at the site of the leak.</p><p>The least invasive endoscopic approach possible should be used, which in most patients involves placement of a transpapillary stent without sphincterotomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F91320\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91320 \">image 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although some authors advocate biliary sphincterotomy alone for treatment of low grade leaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], it is generally desirable to preserve the biliary sphincter whenever possible, particularly in younger patients. It is usually not necessary to place a stent beyond the site of the leak although in clinical practice this is often done due to its technical simplicity. We prefer 7 rather than 10 French stents if a sphincterotomy is not performed due to the theoretically lower risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis&quot;</a>.) The majority of patients will be managed effectively by this approach.</p><p>In the presence of a retained common bile duct stone, a biliary sphincterotomy is usually necessary. Although low grade leaks occurring in the presence of a retained stone can usually be managed by sphincterotomy and stone extraction alone, patients with high grade leaks will likely require a biliary endoprosthesis since sphincterotomy alone does not always completely eliminate the transpapillary pressure gradient.</p><p>Typically, the stent is left in place for approximately four to six weeks. If a percutaneous drain is in place, the drainage should be less than 10 cc per day prior to removing the stent. In our experience with minor bile leaks, placing the percutaneous drain to gravity drainage (rather than continuous bulb suction) shortly after initial stent placement with close monitoring for symptomatic improvement may help to avoid a continuous vacuum into the drain, thereby allowing bile to drain through the stent into the duodenum (rather than into the percutaneous drain). However, this approach has not been studied in trials. In patients without a percutaneous drain, the stent should only be removed once the patient appears well clinically (eg, absence of pain, fever, jaundice, and abdominal distension).</p><p>An alternative approach in sicker inpatients is to combine sphincterotomy with temporary nasobiliary drainage. This technique produces rapid, reliable decompression and a complete diversion of bile flow due to siphoning of the intrahepatic bile flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The sealing of the leak can be confirmed by subsequent cholangiogram via the indwelling nasobiliary tube, often in as little as 24 hours, and the tube can be removed prior to discharge. This technique avoids subsequent repeat endoscopy for stent removal. The disadvantages include patient discomfort and the need for continued hospitalization until the drain is ready for removal.</p><p>There are occasional patients with bile leaks who do not respond to sphincterotomy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> plastic stent placement. Some reports have described that up to 10 percent of patients with bile leaks did not respond to initial endoscopic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A case series suggested that such patients can be managed successfully by temporary placement of a covered, self-expanding metal stent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In another report, n-butyl-2 cyanoacrylate, a tissue glue monomer, was successfully used in seven of nine patients with refractory bile leaks, thus obviating the need for surgical reintervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In approaching apparently refractory bile leaks, the endoscopist must consider the possibility that the leak is coming from transection of an anomalous hepatic duct. This occurs most commonly because of an aberrant right hepatic duct from which the cystic duct arose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66356\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66356 \">figure 1</a>). Leakage is thus from both the distal aspect of what appears to be the cystic duct and the transected right duct branch. Balloon occlusion cholangiography at repeat ERCP may suggest the diagnosis probability. Confirmation may require MRCP, repeat CT scanning, and at times percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. Once recognized, these bile leaks often require surgical management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis and management of biliary injuries'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Biloma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bile leaks usually resolve quickly after placement of a stent. However, placement of a stent will not aid in the reabsorption of an established biloma. As a result, approximately one quarter of patients undergo percutaneous drainage of collections after ERCP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F91643\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91643 \">image 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F91642\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91642 \">image 9</a>). As a general rule, collections remaining symptomatic after successful closure of the leak are better managed with percutaneous drainage. Rapid reabsorption can be expected in most cases, even with large collections. A small percentage of patients (4 to 6 percent) require open surgical drainage for loculated collections. As an alternative, EUS-guided successful treatment by creation of an enteral-biloma fistula has been described in report of five patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Although unproven, it is likely that a delay in referral for endoscopic management may increase the necessity for percutaneous or surgical intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Short-term placement of a biliary stent is definitive therapy for the vast majority of bile leaks that occur in the absence of additional biliary tract injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65102\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65102 \">table 2</a>). A sudden reduction in bile output is usually evident on the first day following the procedure in patients with a previously placed percutaneous drain. In those without complications, stents can be removed without further cholangiography after four to six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. When surgery is necessary it is usually undertaken to drain loculated collections rather than repair defects in the continuity of the biliary tree. Arguably, such an intervention may be avoided by early referral for endoscopic treatment. Complications arising from endoscopic intervention are minimal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MAJOR BILIARY TRACT INJURY WITH OR WITHOUT BILE LEAK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bile duct injuries are identified intraoperatively in up to one quarter of patients, although recognition of injury appears to be less frequent during laparoscopic compared to open cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/13,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,28</a>]. Many of these injuries can be repaired immediately after recognition; some of these patients will subsequently require endoscopic evaluation or intervention.</p><p>For patients with an unrecognized injury, the nature and timing of clinical presentation is variable and primarily influenced by the type of injury. The coexistence of a bile leak (from major duct disruption or complete transection) usually portends an early presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60875%7EGAST%2F68567\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60875 graphicRef68567 \">image 10A-B</a>). In a series of 53 patients, for example, those with a bile leak presented at a median of three days. In contrast, patients who had developed strictures without bile leak had a significantly longer symptom free interval and presented at a median of 57 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The latter patients usually had signs of biliary obstruction (jaundice, cholestatic liver function tests, biliary dilatation on ultrasound). These features were usually absent in patients with a bile leak alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to the patient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of sepsis or peritonitis, the clinical status of the patient with an unrecognized biliary tract injury can deteriorate rapidly. Thus early diagnosis is imperative and imaging should not be delayed if doubt exists. Ultrasonography will detect collections or biliary dilatation. Cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan) is useful for detecting biliary leaks. CT scanning may also be necessary.</p><p>In practice, patients usually have had an ultrasound and CT scan before the endoscopist has been consulted. Cholangiography is performed to define biliary anatomy. ERCP is preferred to percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) due to its lower incidence of complications and because it does not require an indwelling percutaneous drain with the attendant risks of bile leak and sepsis. For similar reasons, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70654\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70654 \">image 11</a>) may be preferred to PTC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69335%7EGAST%2F56602\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69335 graphicRef56602 \">image 12A-B</a>) in patients in whom complete biliary transection precludes ERCP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bile duct injuries have traditionally been seen as the purview of the surgeon, with the biliary endoscopist having a limited role. Controversy continues to exist over the optimal therapeutic algorithm since both methods can be effective and because there have been no large prospective controlled trials comparing surgery with endoscopic management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Such a trial is unlikely to be conducted due to the relative infrequency of the condition, the lack of concentration of such patients within specialist centers, and the heterogeneous nature of the lesions to be dealt with.</p><p>In a retrospective report from the Amsterdam group, the outcome of endoscopic therapy was compared to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This study summarizes the total experience in the management of benign biliary strictures within this unit between 1981 and 1990. Thirty-five patients were selected for surgical management and 66 were managed endoscopically. Patient characteristics, type of initial injury, and level of obstruction were comparable between the two groups, although within the endoscopic group there was a greater proportion of Bismuth type 1 lesions (45 versus 29 percent) and a lesser frequency of Bismuth type 4 lesions (11 versus 20 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66356\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66356 \">figure 1</a>). However, the difference was not significant. After a mean follow-up of 50 months in the surgical group and 42 months in the endoscopic group an excellent (asymptomatic with normal or stable liver function tests) or good (only one episode of cholangitis) response was achieved in 83 percent of patients in both groups.</p><p>There was a significant difference in the early complication rate (26 versus 8 percent) in favor of endoscopy. During the endoscopic treatment protocol (three monthly stent exchanges over 12 months) 21 percent of patients had at least one episode of cholangitis related to stent occlusion. This responded readily to stent exchange in all cases. Surgery involved a bilioenteric anastomosis in all cases (usually a proximal hepatico-jejunostomy with Roux-en-Y jejunal loop). Six patients (17 percent) developed recurrent biliary strictures requiring further surgery at postoperative intervals between 22 and 81 months.</p><p>Similar results have been described in other surgical series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/13,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,30,31</a>]. One group reported a multicenter experience in 49 patients during the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the Netherlands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Three patients died due to a delay in establishing the diagnosis. Twelve patients (25 percent) developed biliary strictures postoperatively at intervals ranging between two weeks and nine months during a relatively short overall follow-up period.</p><p>Another series included 81 patients with post laparoscopic cholecystectomy biliary tract injury at three tertiary referral institutions within the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Sixteen of 17 patients who had biliary enteric bypass performed soon after the initial injury at the referring institution required additional intervention for anastomotic strictures or stenosis.</p><p>In another report, surgery performed in the early postoperative phase was associated with an 80 percent complication rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In comparison, surgery delayed 8 to 12 weeks to allow local inflammatory reactions to settle was attended by only a 17 percent complication rate.</p><p>From these and other published data some reasonable conclusions can be drawn:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major biliary tract injuries are best managed in a tertiary referral center with particular expertise in this field.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cooperative multidisciplinary approach is required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The success of endoscopic therapy depends upon the type of injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery performed in the early postoperative phase in the absence of biliary dilatation and the presence of an acute local inflammatory response with or without ileus or sepsis is likely to ultimately fail. Endoscopic therapy is preferable at this stage. It will establish the diagnosis and may obviate the need for surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An attempt at endoscopic therapy does not preclude subsequent surgical intervention but the converse is not always true. Endoscopic stenting should be seen as a possible definitive therapy and at the very least a bridge to surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopic therapy for strictures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several variations in stenting protocols have been described in the medical literature. As for other benign biliary strictures, the technique involves serial incremental biliary dilatation with successive placement of endoprostheses side by side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Sphincterotomy is usually performed due to the necessity for repeated stent exchanges and side by side stent placement. Endoscopic therapy will usually not succeed in patients who have complete transection of the bile duct, since a guidewire cannot be passed across the lesion into the biliary tree above, although successful stenting has been described in such a patient in a case report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In an additional case, a combined percutaneous-endoscopic approach has been described in the repair of a transected hepatic duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The optimal number, size, endpoints, and frequency of replacement of stents has not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/13,28,35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,28,35-39</a>]. The following two examples illustrate two approaches that have been described in the largest series:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The stenting protocol reported in the most recent series from the Amsterdam group (74 patients) involved placement of two 10F stents (whenever possible), which were exchanged every three months for a total of 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Dilation was required in approximately 25 percent of patients before stent insertion. Percutaneous cholangiography was required in three patients. The stents were removed if the stricture was judged subjectively to be dilated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51984%7EGAST%2F75529%7EGAST%2F62781\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51984 graphicRef75529 graphicRef62781 \">image 13A-C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The stenting protocol described in a group from Rome (42 patients) involved placing as many stents as possible during each session [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Polyethylene straight 10F stents were preferred. Dilation was performed as needed. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography with placement of a guidewire was required in three patients. Long-term follow-up was available for 35 of the patients, with a mean follow-up of 13.7 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Recurrent acute cholangitis occurred in seven patients (20 percent) after a mean of 6.8 years. Four of the patients with cholangitis had postoperative biliary stricture recurrences and were treated with stent placement. The remaining three patients had common bile duct stones that were extracted. No additional recurrences were reported in the seven patients after a mean follow-up of an additional 7.1 years. The other 28 patients remained asymptomatic with no reports of abnormal liver tests or abdominal ultrasound results throughout follow-up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients were scheduled to return for elective stent exchange every three months. At each exchange the number of stents was increased to the maximum permitted by the diameter of the duct distal to the stricture and the diameter of the stricture itself. The mean number of stents inserted ranged from 1 to 4 (mean 1.7) during the initial session to 1 to 6 (mean 3.2) during the last procedure. The treatment protocol was stopped when complete disappearance of the stricture was demonstrated by occlusion cholangiography immediately following stent removal and confirmed by cholangiography through a nasobiliary tube 24 to 48 hours after stent removal. Patients were then followed by clinical evaluation, liver function tests and transabdominal ultrasound after one month, then every three months during the first year and then every six months thereafter.</p><p/><p>At least one group has described successful balloon dilation of strictures in selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, balloon dilation used as monotherapy is unlikely to be successful in the long term, since the relatively transient nature of its effect is insufficient to overcome the ongoing fibro-inflammatory response associated with significant biliary injuries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The results of the published series suggest that endoscopic therapy is ultimately successful in approximately 50 to 75 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Outcomes from the largest two series discussed above illustrate the range of observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the most recent series from the Amsterdam group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], stent placement was successful in 80 percent of patients. Only 44 patients (59 percent of the original cohort and 75 percent of those who had successful initial stent placement) completed 12 months of stent treatment. Fifteen patients dropped out due to noncompliance (10 patients), death (three patients), or need for surgery (two patients).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Recurrent stenosis developed in 9 of the 44 patients (20 percent) after a median follow-up of 9.1 years. Recurrent strictures were observed from two months to 15 years after stent removal (median 2.6 months). All but one of the patients presented within six months. Thus, 47 percent of the original cohort was stricture-free on long-term follow-up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There were a total of 20 deaths (27 percent) during the follow-up period, eight of which appeared to be related to biliary diseases, and five of which were related to ERCP. This suggests an approximate procedure-related mortality rate of 2 to 3 percent and a complication rate of 10 to 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Major complications included cholangitis, pancreatitis, bleeding, and stent migration requiring surgery. Complications were much more likely in patients who were noncompliant with the stent exchange protocol. The complication rate was comparable to that observed in surgical series and emphasizes the difficulty in treating postoperative strictures. This study also suggests that an endoscopic approach may not be suitable in patients who cannot commit to the rigorous ERCP protocol described above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term follow-up (mean 49 months) was possible in 44 of the original 55 patients (76 percent) included in the series from Rome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The other patients were not eligible for the stenting protocol due to complete transection of the bile duct (five patients), placement of a metal stent (five patients), death during stent placement (one patient), the need for surgery (one patient), and loss to follow-up (one patient). Complications included cholangitis (10 patients), pancreatitis (one patient), recurrent jaundice (one patient), and stent migration (five patients, including one who developed duodenal perforation). Two patients died of unrelated causes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">No patient developed clinically significant recurrent strictures. While the follow-up period was shorter than described in Amsterdam group, it was sufficiently long to have revealed the majority of recurrences. Whether the better results can be attributed to the differences in the treatment protocol is unclear. Other possible contributing factors may have been a higher rate of patient compliance in the report from Rome, and other individual patient characteristics.</p><p/><p>Experience in other reports has been similar to that described above. As an example, a preliminary report from a group in Toronto included 21 patients who were followed for a mean of 9.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. An excellent or good response was sustained in 81 percent of patients. Delay in intervention beyond three months after the initial biliary injury appeared to predispose to a less favorable response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H237749971\"><span class=\"h1\">COVERED METAL STENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although traditional therapy for treatment of bile leaks and benign biliary strictures following cholecystectomy has involved placement of 7F and 10F plastic stents, there is increasing evidence to support the use of fully covered metal stents (FCSEMS) for management of both of these conditions. FCSEMS are FDA approved in the US only for the management of benign biliary strictures (BBS) secondary to chronic pancreatitis. The decision to use FCSEMS for complex biliary leaks or BBS following cholecystectomy should be carefully considered on an individual basis, recognizing the potential complications and costs of this intervention. </p><p>The efficacy of FCSEMS has been evaluated only in uncontrolled case series:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For complex bile leaks, defined as those that failed to close after endoscopic intervention with biliary sphincterotomy or plastic stent placement, one case series of 13 patients reported successful resolution of the leak in all patients following placement of a 10 mm FCSEMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The FCSEMS was easily removed in 11 patients following a mean of five months stent duration. Two patients died of unrelated causes before removal was attempted and no complications occurred. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study of 17 patients (12 with BBS and 5 with bile leaks), FCSEMS were placed for a median of two months (range one to eight months) with successful resolution of the bile leak and BBS in 16 of 17 patients (94 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In all 17 patients, the FCSEMS was successfully removed. Complications occurred in 5 of 17 patients (29 percent) and included 2 stent migrations, one stent occlusion, and one case each of cholangitis and sepsis with hepatic abscess.</p><p/><p>The use of FCSEMS in BBS as a result of chronic pancreatitis or liver transplantation is discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation#H148027167\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of endoscopy in biliary complications after liver transplantation&quot;, section on 'Strictures'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-complications-of-chronic-pancreatitis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the complications of chronic pancreatitis&quot;, section on 'Bile duct or duodenal obstruction'</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopic therapy is successful in approximately 90 percent of patients with a postcholecystectomy biliary leak when success is defined as resolution without the need for further surgery. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Bile leak'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of endoscopic therapy in patients with a postcholecystectomy biliary leak is to eliminate the transpapillary pressure gradient, thereby permitting preferential transpapillary bile flow rather than extravasation at the site of the leak. We suggest using the least invasive endoscopic approach possible, which in most patients involves placement of a transpapillary stent without sphincterotomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Bile leak'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The results of endoscopic therapy for major biliary tract injury (excluding disconnection) for selected patients are at least comparable to those of surgery. The two approaches should be seen as complementary. Because of potential complications and technical issues, endoscopic therapy should be performed in centers with highly experienced endoscopists. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Major biliary tract injury with or without bile leak'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">A prospective analysis of 1518 laparoscopic cholecystectomies.
