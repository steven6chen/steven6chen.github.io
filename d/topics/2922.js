The interaction is bidirectional as acute or chronic dysfunction of the heart or kidneys can induce acute or chronic dysfunction in the other organ. The clinical importance of such relationships is illustrated by the following observations: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality is increased in patients with heart failure (HF) who have a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

A 2004 report from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute defined CRS as a condition in which therapy to relieve congestive symptoms of HF is limited by a decline in renal function as manifested by a reduction in GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The reduction in GFR was initially thought to result from a reduction in renal blood flow. However, various studies have demonstrated that cardiorenal interactions occur in both directions and by a variety of mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Issues related to the prevalence of a reduced GFR in patients with HF, the diagnosis of type 1 and 2 CRS, and the mechanisms by which acute and chronic HF lead to worsening renal function are discussed separately.

A possible exception may be seen with diuretic therapy in patients with decompensated HF in whom diuretic therapy may improve survival despite a fall in GFR. (See <a href=\"#H17931529\" class=\"local\">'Diuretics'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81276792\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduced baseline GFR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of moderate to severe reductions in glomerular filtration rate (GFR less than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) in patients with HF has ranged from 30 to 60 percent in large clinical studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. This observation is important clinically because the baseline GFR is a predictor of mortality in both acute and chronic HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-13</a>].</p><p>The following observations illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review of 16 studies included more than 80,000 patients with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The patients were categorized as having normal renal function (estimated GFR [eGFR] 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> or higher), mildly impaired renal function (eGFR 53 to 89 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> serum creatinine greater than 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [88.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L],</span> or serum cystatin C greater than 1.03 to 1.55 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> or moderately to severely impaired renal function (eGFR less than 53 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> serum creatinine of 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [133 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]</span> or higher, or serum cystatin C of 1.56 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or higher). Serum cystatin C may be a better marker of GFR than serum creatinine under certain circumstances because unlike creatinine production, cystatin C production is less dependent upon muscle mass and therefore less influenced by nutritional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The mortality rate at a follow-up of one year or more was 24 percent in those with a normal eGFR compared with 38 and 51 percent in patients with mild and moderate to severe reductions in eGFR, respectively (adjusted hazard ratio 1.6 and 2.3). It was estimated that mortality increased by approximately 15 percent for every 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> reduction in eGFR. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were noted in a report of 2680 patients with chronic HF in the CHARM program who were followed for a median of almost three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. All-cause mortality increased significantly when the baseline eGFR was below 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.09, 95% CI 1.06-1.14 for every 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> decrease in eGFR below 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). The adjusted hazard ratio increased from 1.20 at an eGFR of 60 to 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> to 2.92 at an eGFR below 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. This effect was independent of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), but all-cause mortality increased continuously with reductions in LVEF below 45 percent (adjusted HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.13-1.23 per 5 percent decrease in LVEF). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 4917 patients with a continuous-flow LV assist device (LVAD), worse preimplant renal dysfunction correlated with lower survival rate with an approximately 20 percent lower two-year survival in patients with eGFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> compared with those with eGFR &ge;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The major reduction in survival occurred within the first three months after LVAD implantation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28486497\"><span class=\"h2\">Change in GFR during therapy for HF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preceding observations of increased mortality risk in HF patients with reduced GFR were largely based upon baseline estimates of GFR. The relationship between change in GFR and prognosis is more complex. Worsening or improving GFR is associated with increased mortality risk in some patient populations but the cause of worsening GFR influences it prognostic significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/9,16-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,16-25</a>]. Most of the data on the relationship between change in GFR and outcomes were obtained from patients hospitalized for worsening HF.</p><p>In a study of 3,570,865 United States veterans with an eGFR &ge;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, 156,743 had a diagnosis of HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) was 69.<span class=\"nowrap\">0/1000</span> patient-years in patients with HF versus 14.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/1000</span> patient-years in those without. Twenty-two percent of HF patients compared with 8.5 percent of patients without HF experienced a rapid decline in eGFR. HF patients had greater than two times the risk of incident CKD, a composite of incident CKD or mortality, as well as rapid eGFR decline.</p><p>The best data on the association between worsening renal function and mortality come from a meta-analysis of eight studies with more than 18,000 patients with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Five studies involved hospitalized patients and three involved outpatients. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Worsening renal function, defined as an elevation in serum creatinine of 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (27 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> or more, occurred in 26 percent of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All-cause mortality was significantly higher in the patients with worsening renal function compared with those with a serum creatinine that was unchanged or increased by less than 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (18 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L):</span> 43 versus 36 percent. The findings were the same in hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mortality risk increased progressively with the degree of worsening renal function. The respective odds ratios were:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>1.03 (not significant) when the serum creatinine rose by 0.2 to 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (18 to 27 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> or the eGFR declined by less than 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>1.48 when the serum creatinine rose by 0.3 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (27 to 44 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> or the eGFR declined by 11 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>3.22 when the serum creatinine rose by more than 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (44 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> or the eGFR declined by more than 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup><sub>.</sub></p><p/><p>However, other evidence suggests that patients with improving or worsening renal function may have worse outcomes. Fluctuating renal function may occur in a sicker cohort of patients with significantly worse survival than patients with stable renal function, as illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis of data on 401 patients enrolled in the ESCAPE trial found that patients with an improvement or a decline in estimated GFR during treatment of acute decompensated HF had similar outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Compared with patients with a stable GFR, those with either an improvement or a decline in GFR were significantly more likely to have a reduced cardiac index and to require intravenous inotrope and vasodilator therapy, and had a significantly higher rate of all-cause mortality. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, an observation study of 903 patients found that those with improved GFR during hospitalization for HF had worsened survival compared with patients with stable renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This finding was largely restricted to patients who developed recurrent renal dysfunction post-discharge. </p><p/><p>Additionally, the mechanism of worsening renal function in HF is important in determining its prognostic significance.&nbsp;An analysis of data on 6337 subjects enrolled in the Studies Of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) showed that early worsening renal function was associated with increased mortality in the overall population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].&nbsp;However, in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> group, early worsening renal function was not associated with increased mortality, while in the placebo group, the association with mortality was strengthened. A significant survival benefit from enalapril therapy was observed in patients who continued enalapril despite early worsening renal function. These findings suggest that worsening renal function is not always a marker of adverse clinical outcome. On the contrary, in the case of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor administration, it is a manifestation of the agent&rsquo;s pharmacologic properties, which exert a favorable effect on long-term outcome. </p><p>Other studies of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition have similarly demonstrated beneficial effects on long-term outcomes despite an initial early decline in renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. An analysis of data from the Heart failure End point evaluation of Angiotensin II Antagonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Losartan</a> (HEAAL) trial found that 150 mg losartan compared with 50 mg was associated with increased risk of acute rise in serum creatinine as well as with greater long-term reductions in eGFR, but that despite these effects, high-dose losartan retained its net clinical benefit and was associated with reduced risk of death or HF hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Early decline in GFR in the setting of initiation of RAAS antagonists may reflect antagonism of angiotensin II-mediated efferent arteriolar constriction.</p><p>In addition, as noted below, treatment of decompensated HF with diuretics may improve survival despite worsening renal function. (See <a href=\"#H17931529\" class=\"local\">'Diuretics'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73447122\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood urea nitrogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An elevation in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or blood urea is also associated with increased mortality in patients with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/22,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,30-32</a>], an effect that may be independent of the serum creatinine and GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. A probable contributing factor is that a disproportionate increase in BUN is often seen with a reduction in renal perfusion (ie, prerenal azotemia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;, section on 'BUN and GFR'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiorenal syndrome: Definition, prevalence, diagnosis, and pathophysiology&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17931522\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the limitations imposed by impaired renal function on the ability to correct volume overload and the frequent association between impaired or worsening renal function and mortality in patients with heart failure (HF), it is possible that effective treatment of the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) could improve patient outcomes. On the other hand, the worse prognosis in patients with HF and impaired renal function could primarily reflect a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) being a marker of more severe cardiac disease. In this setting, improving renal function alone would not necessarily improve patient outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H28486377\" class=\"local\">'Reduced GFR and prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p>There are no medical therapies that have been shown to directly increase the GFR (manifested clinically by a decline in serum creatinine) in patients with HF. On the other hand, improving cardiac function can produce increases in GFR, indicating that types 1 and 2 CRS have substantial reversible components.

However, a separate analysis of data from the INTERMACS registry found that early improvements in eGFR with LVAD use were transient and typically only sustained for a period of weeks to months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Analysis of data from an observational study and from the MIRACLE trial found that cardiac resynchronization therapy improved the LV ejection fraction and the eGFR in selected patients with HF and moderately reduced baseline eGFR (30 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].
