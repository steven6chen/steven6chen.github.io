Most head trauma in children is minor and not associated with brain injury or long-term sequelae. However, a small number of children who appear to be at low risk after minor head trauma may have a clinically important traumatic brain (ciTBI) injury. (See <a href=\"#H2286573\" class=\"local\">'Clinically important traumatic brain injury'</a> below.)</p><p>The clinical challenge for evaluating minor head trauma in pediatric patients is to identify those infants and children with ciTBI while limiting unnecessary radiographic imaging and radiation exposure. Neuroimaging, usually with computed tomography (CT), is highly sensitive for identifying brain injury requiring acute intervention. However, individual clinical predictors for ciTBI are often nonspecific, particularly in young children. Thus, evaluation for high-risk findings and the use of a clinical decision rule can provide a balanced approach that identifies almost all infants and children with ciTBI after minor head trauma without overuse of CT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Minor head trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the difference in mechanisms and presentations, it is best to define minor head trauma differently by age as follows (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Incidence of brain injury'</a> below): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Children younger than two years of age</strong> &ndash; Experts define minor head trauma in these patients as a history or physical signs of blunt trauma to the scalp, skull, or brain in an infant or child who is alert or awakens to voice or light touch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Minor head trauma is generally defined separately in children younger than two years of age for the following reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Clinical assessment is more difficult</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infants with intracranial injuries are frequently asymptomatic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Skull fractures or clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) may occur despite minor trauma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inflicted injury occurs more frequently</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Children two years of age and older</strong> &ndash; The definition of minor head trauma for children two years of age and older has often been based upon the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Some have defined minor head trauma as a GCS score of 15, whereas others have included children with scores &ge;13 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59662\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59662 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. However, the rate of traumatic brain injury in children with a GCS of 13 is as high as 20 percent, which makes computed tomography (CT) of the head indicated for most children with this degree of altered mental status.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thus, for the purposes of this discussion, we define minor head trauma in previously healthy children two years of age and older as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>GCS of 14 or 15 at the initial examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No abnormal or focal findings on neurologic examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No physical evidence of skull fracture (eg, no palpable skull defect and no signs of basilar skull fracture such as hemotympanum, CSF oto- or rhinorrhea, or periocular or posterior auricular hematomas)</p><p/><p>However, the clinician should regard these patients as having <strong>apparently</strong> minor head trauma because approximately 5 percent have TBI on neuroimaging, and 1 percent have ciTBI.

Like minor head trauma, patients with mild TBI usually have GCS scores of 13 to 15, measured approximately 30 minutes after the injury. In comparison, patients with moderate TBI generally have initial GCS scores between 9 and 12, whereas those with severe injury have GCS scores &le;8 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59662\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59662 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

As such, concussion is a type of mild traumatic brain injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H26279305\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Concussion in children and adolescents: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Definition'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in adults&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of concussion in children and adolescents are discussed in greater detail separately.

This process has been described in association with severe brain injury and occurs in mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) as well. Whether or not this pattern of injury differs in the developing brain is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Mild TBI usually occurs with head trauma due to contact <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acceleration (including translational and rotational acceleration) or deceleration forces. The type of mechanical forces applied to the brain may determine, to some extent, the nature of the resultant injury as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acceleration occurs when a moving object strikes a stationary head.

Sudden deceleration is thought to be responsible for most severe brainstem injuries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rotation of the brain occurs when the head is struck in an asymmetric manner or an infant is vigorously shaken. Rotational acceleration-deceleration can induce widespread injury including large subdural hematomas.

Among US children younger than 14 years of age, traumatic brain injury (TBI) accounts for approximately 500,000 emergency department (ED) visits, 37,000 hospitalizations and over 2000 deaths annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In developed countries, TBI is the most common cause of death and disability in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>Most children with head trauma are young, male, and have a mild injury. This was demonstrated in a large prospective series that described minor head trauma in 10,965 children in the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Fifty-five percent of children were younger than five years of age, with 28 percent younger than two years of age. Boys accounted for 65 percent of patients, and 98 percent of children had Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores of 15. Other series of children with head trauma have reported lower GCS scores but many of these describe selected populations, such as children with head injury who had neuroimaging performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Falls are the most common mechanism of injury for children sustaining minor head trauma, followed by motor vehicle crashes, pedestrian and bicycle accidents, projectiles, assaults, sports-related trauma, and abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/7,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16</a>].

It is of utmost importance to identify children who have sustained an inflicted head injury, even if the injury is minor. Children who remain in the care of the perpetrator are at significant risk for being injured again.

Most studies providing incidence data are from selected populations in which children with moderate to severe injury are overrepresented (eg, including only children who have had computed tomography [CT] or primarily children with nontrivial trauma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. Consequently, the risk of ciTBI in these series may be overestimated.</p><p>Estimates of the incidence of TBI following head trauma from selected populations are summarized as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among children two years of age and older with minor head trauma and a normal neurologic examination, 3 to 7 percent may have a TBI noted on CT scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/7,17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17-21</a>]. Approximately 1 percent have ciTBI, and 0.1 to 0.6 percent require surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/8,19,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,19,22,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children younger than two years with minor head trauma and a normal neurologic examination, approximately 3 to 10 percent have a TBI on CT, 1 percent have ciTBI, and 0.2 percent require surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/7,8,17-19,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,17-19,24</a>]. Many of these younger children have no clinical symptoms of brain injury (19 to 48 percent), although most of these patients have scalp hematomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/7,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,25,26</a>].

However, only 2 to 3 percent of patients in these studies underwent neuroimaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/9,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3332938\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with shunts or bleeding disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the threshold for obtaining neuroimaging after minor head trauma in patients with ventricular shunts or bleeding disorders is lower for many clinicians, it is not clear that clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) after minor head trauma actually occurs more frequently than in normal children. As an example, in planned secondary analyses of a large multicenter observational study of children with minor head injury, approximately 1 percent of children with either ventricular shunts (98 children) or bleeding disorders (230 children) had a ciTBI (eg, head injury resulting in death, neurosurgery, intubation &gt;24 hours, or hospital admission &gt;2 nights) compared with 0.9 percent of the approximately 40,000 normal children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. However, with the low numbers of patients in these studies, the true frequency of ciTBI following minor head trauma in children with bleeding disorders or ventricular shunts could be as high as 4 to 5 percent, respectively. Furthermore, the rate of ciTBI seen in children with bleeding disorders occurred despite significantly fewer severe mechanisms of injury when compared with normal children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89479938\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to reports of the incidence of clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI), some studies that describe clinical features following minor head trauma only included children who underwent head computed tomography (CT).

As an example, in one large multicenter, prospective cohort study of 5850 children with LOC after mild head trauma, 0.5 percent of 2780 children with isolated LOC, defined as LOC without any of the age-related PECARN clinical predictors for ciTBI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58477\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58477 \">table 2</a>), had ciTBI compared with 4 percent of 3070 children with LOC and other PECARN clinical predictors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In this study, longer duration of LOC was also associated with ciTBI occurring in 1 percent of 907 children with LOC for &lt;5 seconds and up to 4 percent of 200 children with LOC &gt;5 minutes.

As an example, in a multicenter observational study of 2998 children younger than 24 months of age with an isolated scalp hematoma, 50 of 570 children (8.8 percent) that underwent CT had TBI (eg, subdural or epidural hematomas, cerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhages, or cerebral contusion). Of 111 patients younger than three months with any hematoma who underwent CT, 21 percent (23 out of 111) had TBI on CT confirming that an isolated scalp hematoma is an important indicator of potential brain injury in neonates and young infants. However, ciTBI occurred in only 12 patients (0.4 percent of all 2998 patients), <strong>none</strong> of whom died or required neurosurgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. On multivariate analysis, characteristics independently associated with TBI on CT included younger age, larger hematoma size, nonfrontal hematoma location, and more severe mechanisms of injury.

As an example, of 5557 children evaluated for vomiting after minor head trauma at multiple centers, ciTBI occurred in 0.2 percent (95% CI 0-0.9 percent) of 815 children with isolated vomiting (ie, vomiting alone without other findings of ciTBI) and in 2.5 percent (95% CI 2.1-3.0 percent) of 4577 children with vomiting and other findings of ciTBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Although the incidence of ciTBI among those with isolated vomiting was low, it was higher than patients without vomiting or other high risk symptoms (0.2 versus 0.04 percent). In a case control study comparing 162 children with mild head injury (as defined by discharge to home from the emergency department [ED]) and vomiting with matched controls, predictors of vomiting included a personal history of vomiting, motion sickness, and headache associated with the injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Whether the number of vomiting episodes and the timing of these episodes can help identify patients with ciTBI is unclear. Vomiting two or more times after head trauma was associated with an approximately 37 percent increase in traumatic brain injury in one multicenter observational study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, increased frequency or later onset of vomiting after head injury did <strong>not</strong> identify children with ciTBI in another multicenter cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469050479\"><span class=\"h4\">Headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Headache is a frequent complaint, occurring in up to 46 percent of verbal children with minor blunt head trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

However, in patients with isolated headaches, the incidence of ciTBI is low. As an example, in a planned secondary analysis of a large, multicenter cohort of almost 28,000 verbal children 2 to 18 years of age with minor head trauma, none of the 2462 patients with an isolated headache using an expanded definition, including no scalp findings, had ciTBI compared to 1.6 percent of the 10,105 patients with headache and other symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Head CT identifies essentially all ciTBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It can be rapidly obtained in most hospitals. Skull radiography is of little or no added value if a head CT is performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to neuroimaging in children&quot;, section on 'CT applications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to neuroimaging in children&quot;, section on 'Plain radiographs'</a>.)</p><p>The decision to obtain a head CT for children with minor head trauma must balance the importance of identifying a significant, but rare ciTBI with the estimated risks of late onset malignancy associated with radiation exposure from CT. The risk of death or major disability if a ciTBI is missed is considerable and immediate. Furthermore, evidence suggests that a clinician&rsquo;s ability to predict the presence of such an injury in patient without high-risk findings (eg, altered mental status, focal neurologic examination, or signs of basilar skull fracture) is poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, the estimated lifetime risk of cancer mortality from a head CT is substantially higher for children than for adults because of a longer subsequent lifetime and the greater sensitivity of some developing organs (eg, brain or bone marrow) to radiation. Estimates suggest that the lifetime risk of death due to cancer caused by radiation from one head CT is 1 in 1500 in a one year old infant and 1 in 5000 in a 10 year old child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. However, the latency period for development of cancer may be decades. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to neuroimaging in children&quot;, section on 'Radiation'</a>.)</p><p>Thus, the probability of ciTBI as determined by clinical findings is a key factor for identifying the optimal approach in individual patients. As an example, in a clinical decision analysis of the optimal neuroimaging strategy that weighed the risk of ciTBI with the risk of radiation exposure from head CT and subsequent malignancy for children younger than two years of age with minor head trauma, no imaging was the best strategy when the probability of ciTBI was about 0.9 percent and head CT was the preferred strategy only for patients at higher risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1236231\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical decision rules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical decision rules are not intended to replace clinical judgment. Based upon existing evidence, they assist rather than completely direct the clinician&rsquo;s approach to neuroimaging of children with minor head trauma.</p><p>For infants and children with minor head trauma, absence of high-risk signs or symptoms of ciTBI, we suggest that management decisions, especially the performance of neuroimaging and observation, be guided by the use of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) low-risk clinical decision rules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58477\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58477 \">table 2</a>) rather than other rules because it was derived in the largest cohort and has the best discrimination for serious intracranial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/7,55-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,55-59</a>].

Common reasons for ordering CTs in these patients thought to be at low risk included young age, mechanism of injury, and specific isolated findings that are addressed by the PECARN rules (eg, scalp hematoma in patients younger than 2 years of age and loss of consciousness or headache in children 2 years of age and older).
