There is an inverse relationship between age at treatment initiation and intelligence quotient (IQ) later in life, so that the longer the condition goes undetected and untreated, the lower the IQ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Definition, diagnosis, and assessment of needs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most newborn babies with congenital hypothyroidism have few or no clinical manifestations of thyroid hormone deficiency. In addition, the majority of cases are sporadic, so it is not possible to predict which infants are likely to be affected. For these reasons, newborn screening programs were developed to detect this condition as early as possible, by measuring either thyroxine (T4) or thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) in heel-stick blood specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These screening efforts were initiated in the mid-1970s, and have been largely successful, although severely affected infants may still have a slightly reduced IQ and other neurologic deficits despite prompt diagnosis and initiation of therapy.</p><p>This topic will review the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism, and its detection by newborn screening in full-term infants.

The incidence varies by geographic location and by ethnicity. Reports from screening programs in the United States, Canada, European countries, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan note an incidence between 1:2000 to 1:4000 newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The reported incidence varies among racial and ethnic groups, with rates of approximately 1:1200 in Asian Indian infants; 1:2380 in Asian (Chinese and Vietnamese) infants; 1:1600 in Hispanic infants; 1:3533 in non-Hispanic white infants; and 1:11,000 in non-Hispanic black infants, as reported over a seven-year period from California [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Further, the incidence appears to be increased in twin births (1:900), and even higher in multiple births (1:600) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The highest incidence, 1:581, was reported from the Markazi Province in Iran, likely related to consanguinity and a higher occurrence of autosomal recessive inborn errors of thyroid hormone synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>There appears to be a trend of increasing incidence of congenital primary hypothyroidism detected by newborn screening programs, from 1:4000 in the mid-1970s to 1:2000 by 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This increase likely is the result of lowering of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) cut-offs in TSH-based screening programs, leading to detection of milder cases of primary hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], along with changes in population demographics (with more births in those populations with a higher incidence), rather than an actual increase in the incidence of the disorder itself.</p><p>Nearly all screening programs report a female preponderance, approaching a 2:1 female to male ratio. A report from Quebec shows that this female preponderance occurs mostly in cases of thyroid ectopy, and less so in those with agenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Another study from Quebec found that thyroid dysgenesis was more prevalent in white than in black infants, whereas dyshormonogenesis occurred equally in both racial groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Thyroid dysgenesis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 85 percent of permanent cases of congenital hypothyroidism are sporadic (mostly caused by thyroid dysgenesis), and 15 percent are hereditary (most caused by one of the inborn errors of thyroid hormone synthesis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F68356\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68356 \">table 1</a>). As noted above, the apparent increasing incidence of congenital hypothyroidism is likely due to the detection of milder cases, including cases of subclinical hypothyroidism and transient hypothyroidism. In a study from Japan, patients with hypothyroidism detected by newborn screening were reevaluated at ages 5 to 19 years. Among the cases with overt hypothyroidism (high thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] with low thyroxine [T4]), 73 percent were caused by thyroid dysgenesis, whereas of cases of subclinical hypothyroidism (high TSH with normal T4), only 36 percent were caused by thyroid dysgenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, some of these disorders may present after the neonatal period and are sometimes called &quot;late-onset congenital hypothyroidism.&quot; Late-onset disease is most often caused by one of the inborn errors of thyroid hormone synthesis or an ectopic thyroid gland. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired hypothyroidism in childhood and adolescence&quot;, section on 'Late-onset congenital hypothyroidism'</a> and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Disorders of thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Defects in thyroid hormone transport'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455227955\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary hypothyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary hypothyroidism refers to inadequate thyroid hormone production in the gland itself.

Thyroid ectopy accounts for two-thirds of the dysgenesis cases worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In a study of 230 infants with permanent primary hypothyroidism, representing 90 percent of all infants identified by newborn screening in Quebec from 1988 to 1997, 61 percent had ectopic thyroid tissue, 16 percent had thyroid agenesis, 4 percent had a normal-sized thyroid, and 18 percent had a goiter, as determined by radionuclide imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. More girls than boys had thyroid ectopy (104 versus 37), but there were similar numbers of girls and boys in other groups. Among these infants, 5 percent had other congenital abnormalities, mostly cardiac septal defects. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Associated congenital malformations'</a> below.)</p><p>Although most cases of thyroid dysgenesis are sporadic, there is evidence of a <span class=\"nowrap\">familial/genetic</span> component in some patients.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 2472 patients with congenital hypothyroidism resulting from thyroid dysgenesis (identified by newborn screening in France between 1980 and 1998), 48 cases (2 percent) appeared to be familial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The distribution of various causes of hypothyroidism in both the sporadic and familial groups was similar to that in the Quebec study.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further evidence of a genetic component comes from a study of 84 children with congenital hypothyroidism, whose first-degree relatives were more likely to have asymptomatic thyroid developmental abnormalities than controls (21.4 and 0.9 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This suggests there is a common genetic component of congenital hypothyroidism with heterogeneous phenotypes. However, there was discordance for thyroid dysgenesis in all monozygotic twins (five pairs) and dizygotic twins (seven pairs) in both the Quebec and Brussels screening centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The explanation for discordance in monozygotic twins is unknown, but it may be explained by differences in somatic autosomal monoallelic gene expression between the twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rare cases of thyroid dysgenesis have been associated with loss-of-function mutations in paired box 8 (<em>PAX8)</em>, thyroid transcription factor-2 (<em>TTF2</em>, also called <em>FOXE1</em>), transcription factors NK2 homeobox&nbsp;1 (<em>NKX2.1</em>, formerly called <em>TTF1</em>) NK2 homeobox 5 (<em>NKX2.5)</em>, <em>GLIS3</em>, jagged 1 (<em>JAG1</em>), and borealin (<em>CDCA8</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/18-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-25</a>]. Mutations in these genes may be associated with congenital anomalies of other tissues. A heterozygous mutation in <em>PAX8</em> was associated with congenital hypothyroidism and anomalies of the urogenital tract (horseshoe kidney, ureterocele, undescended testes, and hydrocele) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A homozygous missense mutation in <em>TTF2</em> resulted not only in thyroid agenesis, but cleft palate in two male siblings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, not all <em>TTF2</em> mutations are associated with thyroid agenesis, as shown by a case report of a patient with congenital hypothyroidism and a <em>TTF2</em> mutation, associated with cleft palate, spiky hair, and bilateral choanal atresia (Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], with normally located thyroid tissue demonstrated by thyroid scan. <em>NKX2.1</em> is expressed in both the thyroid and central nervous system (CNS). Mutations in <em>NKX2.1</em> have been reported to result in congenital hypothyroidism with persistent neurologic problems, including ataxia, despite early thyroid hormone treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/19,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,27</a>]. <em>GLIS3</em> mutations have been described in cases of congenital hypothyroidism associated with neonatal diabetes mellitus, congenital glaucoma, hepatic fibrosis, and polycystic kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. <em>JAG1</em> mutations most commonly are reported in patients with Alagille syndrome type 1, with some cases also associated with thyroid hypoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) have a higher incidence of hypothyroidism detected by newborn screening programs, occurring in as many as 1:50 newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Mild elevations of TSH with normal T4 levels are also relatively common in this population. Whereas older children with trisomy 21 have autoimmune thyroid disease, the hypothyroidism seen in neonates is not associated with antithyroid antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. There is speculation that the extra chromosome 21 results in genomic dosage imbalance of dosage-sensitive genes interfering with thyroid hormone production.

Such defects are increasingly recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In a report from Japan, TSH receptor mutations were present in 4.3 percent of patients with congenital hypothyroidism (1:118,000 of the general population) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In a report from Great Britain, TSH receptor mutations were identified in 5 percent of children with congenital nongoitrous hypothyroidism born to consanguineous families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In some forms of pseudohypoparathyroidism, which results from a G-protein alpha subunit (<em>GNAS</em>) defect, there is interference with TSH signaling in addition to that of parathyroid hormone (PTH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. TSH resistance can be associated with pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1A (PHP1A), which is due to a heterozygous mutation in the <em>GNAS</em> gene, or less commonly with pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B (PHP1B), which is caused by a defect in the methylation pattern of the <em>GNAS</em> locus (both maternal in origin). When such cases are detected by newborn screening, the hypothyroidism is mild and, despite thyroid hormone treatment, linear growth slows, accompanied by excessive weight gain. Such cases should then be screened for hypocalcemia and elevated PTH levels, to confirm PTH resistance. A complex phenotype of congenital hypothyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism has been described in the presence of a combination of inactivating mutations of the TSH receptor gene and mutations of the downstream <em>GNAS </em>gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

The presence of normal (or reduced) radionuclide uptake in normally located thyroid tissue supports a diagnosis of mild, possibly transient hypothyroidism. Cases of transient hypothyroidism due to transplacental passage of maternal TSH-receptor blocking antibodies (TRB-Ab) typically do not have radionuclide uptake or image on scanning, but on ultrasonography a normal thyroid gland may be visualized.

If an ectopic thyroid gland is identified by ultrasound (typically found in the lingual, sublingual, or subhyoid areas), radionuclide imaging will not be necessary, thus avoiding radiation exposure and expense. However, ultrasound is not as reliable as radionuclide imaging in identifying cases of thyroid dysgenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. In studies comparing the two procedures, some infants had ectopic thyroid tissue detected by radionuclide imaging, but the ultrasound images revealed either no thyroid tissue or thyroid hypoplasia; in some of the other infants, radionuclide imaging revealed thyroid agenesis or hypoplasia but the ultrasound images were normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,107</a>].

Either 99m-pertechnetate or 123-I-iodine should be used instead of 131-I-iodine because the radiation doses are much lower. 99m-pertechnetate may be more readily available and allows a good scan picture, but because it is not organified, there is no measure of uptake. 123-I must be specially ordered, due to its short half-life, but it will provide both a scan and a measure of uptake. A large gland in a normal location typically is seen with one of the enzymatic defects.
