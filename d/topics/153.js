The largest tendon in the body, the Achilles tendon, endures strain and risks rupture from running, jumping, and sudden acceleration or deceleration. Overuse, vascular diseases, neuropathy, and rheumatologic diseases may cause tendon degeneration. The hallmarks of Achilles tendon problems seem to be damaged, weak, inelastic tissue. </p><p>This topic review will discuss the mechanism, diagnosis, and management of Achilles tendinopathy and tendon rupture. A general discussion of treatments for tendinopathy is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of overuse (chronic) tendinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tendonitis, tendinosis, tendinopathy, paratendonitis, enthesopathy, and insertional tendonitis are among the terms used to characterize acute or chronic tendon pain. The common term tendonitis is confusing because inflammation is often not seen on histopathology. Throughout this review, we will use the term tendinopathy to refer to acute and chronic pain associated with an Achilles tendon injury other than tendon tear or rupture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy#H32168053\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of overuse (chronic) tendinopathy&quot;, section on 'Pathology and terminology: tendinosis versus tendinitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Achilles tendinopathy affects competitive and recreational athletes as well as people who are not active [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The incidence of Achilles tendon rupture in the general population is approximately 5 to 10 per 100,000, but may be higher in some regions and populations, and increasing overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Over 80 percent of ruptures occur during recreational sports. Approximately 10 percent of patients who sustain an Achilles tendon rupture had preexisting Achilles tendon problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Observational data suggest that competitive athletes have a lifetime incidence of Achilles tendinopathy of 24 percent, with 18 percent sustained by athletes younger than 45 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Tendon rupture occurs in 8.3 percent. Among competitive runners, the lifetime incidence of Achilles tendinopathy may be as high as 40 to 50 percent.</p><p>Competitive athletes with a high lifetime incidence of tendon rupture include sprinters (18 percent), decathletes (17 percent), soccer players (17 percent), track and field jumpers (12 percent), basketball players (12 percent), and ice hockey players (9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Achilles tendinopathy in recreational runners, although less likely to involve rupture, accounts for 6 to 17 percent of all running injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Military recruits develop tendinopathy at a rate of 6.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Cold weather training is associated with higher rates of tendon pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Foot misalignment, poor running mechanics (excessive supination, inadequate dorsiflexion), inappropriate footwear, and leg length discrepancy are associated with tendon pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Age, male gender, and obesity are risk factors for Achilles tendon problems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81284\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81284 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The peak age for rupture is 30 to 40 years for both men and women; this may be when degenerative changes and occasional high stress from sports coincide. Rupture is four to five times more common in men than women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As participation in recreational sports has increased over the past 50 years, so has the rate of tendon rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Fluoroquinolone antibiotics are rarely associated with Achilles tendinopathy or tendon rupture. A study of 46,776 patients treated with fluoroquinolones found 3.2 cases of tendon problems for every 1000 years of exposure. Symptoms typically developed within one week of initiating treatment (median 6 days; range 1 to 510 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and the vast majority (85 to 93 percent) of patients reported symptoms within one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Among symptomatic patients without tendon rupture, most report recovery within two months of discontinuing the fluoroquinolone antibiotic, but in 26 percent, pain and disability persisted at long-term follow-up (timeframe not specified) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. According to a large case-control study, the incidence of tendon rupture associated with fluoroquinolone therapy is estimated at 12 per 100,000 treatment episodes (odds ratio [OR] 1.3; 95% CI 1.0-1.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The risk of suffering an Achilles tendon rupture is increased threefold during the first 90 days among patients taking a fluoroquinolone for the first time. The mechanism remains unknown. Age older than 60 years and concurrent use of systemic glucocorticoids further increases the risk of Achilles problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. Past fluoroquinolone use does not appear to confer future risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoroquinolones#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fluoroquinolones&quot;, section on 'Tendinopathy and tendon rupture'</a>.)</p><p>Oral glucocorticoids alone increase the risk of tendinopathy, although studies estimating the precise risk in primary care populations are lacking. Local glucocorticoid injection causes tendon damage in animal models, and there are case reports in humans of tendon rupture following glucocorticoid injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>In women, hypertension is associated with Achilles tendinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Other diseases associated with tendinopathy include psoriasis and ankylosing spondylosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Heel pain is rarely the presenting symptom in patients with these systemic diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The soleus and gastrocnemius muscles converge to form the Achilles tendon, which inserts posteriorly on the calcaneus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58376\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58376 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93694\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93694 \">picture 1</a>). Contraction of these muscles, along with the actions of the tibialis posterior and peroneus longus and brevis, causes the foot to plantar flex. The subcutaneous and subtendinous (or retrocalcaneal) calcaneal bursae cushion the insertion area anteriorly and posteriorly. Most pain and tendon ruptures occur where the blood supply of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle complex is poorest, 2 to 6 cm above the insertion point. A peritendinous sheath of connective tissue allows the tendon to slide relative to surrounding tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute Achilles tendon pain generally develops when athletes abruptly increase their activity (eg, runners who start training for a marathon). Chronic tendon pain (&gt;3 months) may result from sustained stress, poor running mechanics (eg, supination, heel misalignment), or improper footwear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/13,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,25</a>]. Some experts claim a role for excessive pronation in Achilles tendinopathy among runners, but others dispute this.</p><p>Recurrent microtrauma causes degeneration of the Achilles tendon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/13,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,26</a>]. The relative hypovascularity of the tendon 2 to 6 cm from its insertion point may prevent adequate healing. Although inflammation is often not seen on histopathology, clinical signs similar to those seen with inflammation (such as swelling, warmth, and pain) may occur. Damaged tendons become calcified, thickened, inelastic, and fibrotic. Abnormal neovascularization of tissue may be seen on ultrasound. Aging and vascular disease decrease collagen density, break collagen cross-links, and reduce the elasticity of the tendon sheath and tendon itself. Rupture occurs when a sudden shear stress (eg, cutting during a basketball game) is applied to an already weakened or degenerative tendon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Apart from Achilles tendinopathy, pain arising from the region between the posterior calcaneus and the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle complex may be caused by several other conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76217\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76217 \">table 2</a>). Ankle sprain is the most common misdiagnosis when tendon rupture is the actual cause of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Differentiating the two can be difficult. In contrast to ankle sprains, where injury occurs with landing, symptom onset with tendon rupture generally occurs as the patient is pushing off with their foot. Do NOT assume rupture is absent because the patient can plantar-flex their ankle or walk. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ankle-sprain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ankle sprain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcaneal bursitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcaneal bursitis (subcutaneous or subtendinous) typically occurs in middle-aged or elderly patients. Patients may complain of pain where the back of a hard shoe or a strap rubs against the heel at the Achilles tendon insertion point. Sports in which athletes wear hard-backed footwear or repeatedly strike their heels against walls (eg, indoor soccer, hockey) may cause bursitis. Bursitis generally resolves with basic measures: heel lifts, avoiding bothersome footwear, rest, ice, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Heel pain may also stem from an injury or strain at the Achilles tendon insertion (ie, enthesopathy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bursitis-an-overview-of-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bursitis: An overview of clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcaneal apophysitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcaneal apophysitis (ie, Sever's syndrome) is a stress fracture overuse injury in young athletes aged 8 to 15 years. Patients with calcaneal apophysitis have activity related pain in the posterior aspect of the heel, which may be unilateral or bilateral. Symptoms generally resolve within three to six weeks with conservative treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heel-pain-in-the-active-child-or-skeletally-immature-adolescent-overview-of-causes#H171104602\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heel pain in the active child or skeletally immature adolescent: Overview of causes&quot;, section on 'Calcaneal apophysitis (Sever disease)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Tendinopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with Achilles tendinopathy typically complain of pain or stiffness 2 to 6 cm above the posterior calcaneus. They are likely to be casual or competitive athletes who have increased their training regimen beyond their tendon's ability to heal the microtrauma from repetitive stress, or who have been training rigorously for a long time. A history of excessive supination, increased speed work or hill training, or improper or worn out footwear may be found.</p><p>The pain is usually described as burning. The pain is worse with activity and relieved after a period of rest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Tendon rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tendon rupture occurs when sudden forces are exerted upon the Achilles tendon during strenuous physical activities that involve sudden pivoting on a foot or rapid acceleration (eg, stop and go sports such as tennis, basketball, or softball). Many patients feel as if they were struck violently in the back of the ankle. Some hear a &quot;pop&quot; and experience severe acute pain, although the absence of pain does not rule out rupture. As an example, a small case series found that one-third of patients with tendon rupture did not report pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In contrast to ankle sprains, where injury occurs with landing, symptom onset with tendon rupture generally occurs as the patient is pushing off with their foot.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">General evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of the Achilles tendon is usually straightforward because the tendon is easily identified and palpated. However, potential pitfalls exist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70182\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70182 \">table 3</a>). Of note, a sizable minority of patients with complete tendon rupture are able to ambulate.</p><p>Patients should be examined lying prone with their feet hanging off the end of the examination table. Inspect the region of the Achilles tendon for bruising (blood tracking beneath the malleolus suggests fracture, sprain, or tendon rupture), swelling, and foot misalignment. Assess patients for signs of peripheral artery disease, such as decreased pulsations, decreased capillary refill in the heel or toes, loss of hair, increased skin pigmentation, or edema.</p><p>Palpate the Achilles tendon for tenderness, thickening, or a defect, recognizing that edema or a hematoma may mask such a defect. Palpation has a sensitivity of approximately 73 percent and specificity of 89 percent in detecting a partial tendon tear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Comparison to the unaffected side is useful.</p><p>Patients with tendinopathy typically have localized tenderness 2 to 6 cm proximal to the insertion of the tendon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F91862\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91862 \">picture 2</a>). In comparison, tenderness around the insertion point near the heel suggests either subcutaneous calcaneal bursitis or enthesopathy (strain of tendon at its insertion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Warmth and tenderness localized to the soft tissue anterior to the area where the Achilles inserts suggests subcutaneous bursitis, although this condition is uncommon. Focal tenderness of the tendon itself in the area where it inserts suggests enthesopathy.</p><p>The tendon should be palpated as the patient dorsi-flexes and plantar-flexes the foot, as well as when the ankle is stationary in a neutral position. The presence of crepitus with motion suggests tendinopathy. </p><p>Isolating the subtendinous bursa (ie, retrocalcaneal bursa) and palpating it for tenderness may identify bursitis. We perform this examination as follows: Grasp the Achilles tendon with the fingers of one hand and move the tendon side to side. Bursitis should not cause pain when only the tendon is palpated. Next, with the index finger on the opposite hand, apply gentle pressure just behind the tendon. Continue to grasp the tendon with the other hand to be certain you are palpating the bursa and not the tendon. Local warmth and tenderness behind the tendon with light pressure suggests the subtendinous (or retrocalcaneal) bursa is inflamed. </p><p>Examine the patient's footwear, looking for signs of excessive breakdown (eg, disproportionate wear on the inner or outer edge) or other evidence of poor running mechanics. Examine the architecture of the patient's foot. The presence of flat feet (pes planus), heel malalignment, high arches (pes cavus), or leg length discrepancy can contribute to poor running mechanics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. If possible, assess the patient's gait or running stride looking for abnormalities or asymmetry.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Special tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The calf squeeze or Thompson test provides an accurate means for detecting complete Achilles tendon rupture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74412\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74412 \">picture 3</a>). To perform the test, the patient either lies prone with their feet hanging off the end of the examination table, or kneels on a chair. The clinician squeezes the gastrocnemius muscle belly while watching for plantar flexion. The absence of plantar flexion when squeezing the gastrocnemius muscle marks a positive test indicative of rupture.</p><p>The calf squeeze test is a more reliable indication of tendon rupture than the inability to plantar flex, since patients may be able to plantar flex the foot using accessory muscles (eg, tibialis posterior, peroneals). Twenty to 30 percent of Achilles tendon ruptures are missed at the initial visit because the clinician was falsely reassured by the patient's ability to plantar flex or walk.</p><p>In a series of 174 patients with a clinical diagnosis of unilateral complete Achilles tendon tear and 28 patients with unilateral suspected but no actual Achilles tendon tear, the Thompson test had a sensitivity of 96 percent and a specificity of 93 percent, using MRI or ultrasound as a gold standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A negative test can miss up to 10 percent of ruptures (assuming a 75 percent pretest probability of rupture). Thus, confirmatory testing such as diagnostic ultrasound or MRI is useful when the Thompson test is negative but clinical suspicion remains high. </p><p>The Matles test is another means of assessing Achilles tendon rupture. To perform the test, the patient lies prone with knees flexed to 90 degrees. Observe whether the affected foot is dorsiflexed or neutral (both are abnormal) compared with the uninjured side, where the foot should appear plantar-flexed. The sensitivity and specificity of the Matles test was 88 percent and 85 percent, respectively, in the above study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Achilles tendinopathy (without rupture) is a clinical diagnosis. Imaging is generally not necessary except to rule out other conditions, such as a stress fracture or tendon rupture.</p><p>Plain radiographs are generally unhelpful in the assessment of Achilles tendon pathology but may reveal a heel spur or bony bump (called a Haglund's deformity or &quot;pump bump&quot;) consistent with both tendinopathy and calcaneal bursitis.</p><p>Ultrasound imaging is increasingly used to assess tendon appearance and function. Ultrasound may reveal normal tendon, tendon thickening, or signs of more significant tendon pathology, such as neovessels, hypoechogenicity, disordered fibers, tissue gaps, and fluid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F89675\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89675 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Ultrasound can also help to distinguish between Achilles tendon injury and other pathology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F91863\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91863 \">image 2</a>).</p><p>Achilles tendon rupture may be diagnosed solely by clinical examination, but ultrasound enables rapid bedside confirmation of the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Although published data is limited, in experienced hands, ultrasound appears to be an accurate tool for diagnosing Achilles tendon tear and distinguishing between partial and complete tears. As an example, ultrasound was reported to have 100 percent sensitivity, 83 percent specificity, and 92 percent accuracy for distinguishing between partial and full thickness Achilles tendon tears, using surgical findings as the gold standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In addition dynamic ultrasound can demonstrate whether tendon fragments come into contact during plantar flexion. If they do not, this is a strong indication that surgical repair is needed.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often used to assess musculoskeletal complaints and is the study of choice when tendon rupture is suspected and high quality diagnostic ultrasound is unavailable. MRI provides greater anatomic detail and greater accuracy in detecting partial Achilles tendon tears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. With tendinopathy, MRI may demonstrate an increased T2 weighted signal in the tendon or an increased tendon diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In addition, MRI may reveal alternative explanations for patient symptoms, such as enlarged calcaneal bursae.</p><p>Neither ultrasound nor MRI findings appear to correlate closely with clinically significant chronic Achilles tendinopathy. In one small prospective study, ultrasound detected abnormal morphology in 37 of 57 symptomatic Achilles tendons, while MRI detected abnormalities in 19 of 34 (MRI was performed in a subset of 25 consecutive patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Better baseline MRI appearance was associated with a successful return to sport and symptomatic benefit after 12 months, but baseline ultrasound findings were not. Further study of these diagnostic tests is needed to determine their appropriate role in the management of Achilles tendinopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135765374\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL ULTRASOUND RESOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Instructional videos demonstrating proper performance of the ultrasound examination of the ankle, including the Achilles tendon, and related pathology can be found at the website of the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine: <a href=\"https://www.amssm.org/TestingDetails.php?IDtest=84&amp;token=+CjrhIBVW0jZK35njTvgceBoc89/qjKZO3f/yKxTQKSohmLSi4ETNC5L3Quc15hV7XGXvUicrr8JaSgWv1coQw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=190\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">sports US ankle-foot pathology</a>.

Although there is no compelling evidence that NSAIDs enable patients to return to full activity sooner, these drugs are a reasonable choice for short-term pain relief in patients with acute Achilles tendinopathy.

This conclusion is consistent with studies of glucocorticoid injection for other tendinopathies. Glucocorticoid injection may provide short-term symptom relief in some cases.

Nevertheless, many clinicians believe imbalances in muscle strength or flexibility predispose some athletes to injury. We believe it is reasonable to include stretching following exercise or a warm up as part of an Achilles injury prevention regimen. Typical techniques include stretching the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles while bracing one&rsquo;s hands against a wall or dorsiflexing the foot using a stretch band. It may be helpful for patients to undergo assessment by an athletic trainer, physical therapist, or sports medicine specialist to identify imbalances in flexibility or strength and to receive instruction in appropriate training techniques.</p><p>Although high body mass index (BMI) is associated with tendon problems, no studies clearly show that weight loss prevents such problems.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain arising from the region between the posterior calcaneus and the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle complex may be caused by a number of conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76217\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76217 \">table 2</a>). Ankle sprain is the most common misdiagnosis when tendon rupture is the actual cause of pain. Do not assume rupture is absent because the patient can plantar flex or walk. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with Achilles tendinopathy typically experience pain or stiffness 2 to 6 cm above the posterior calcaneus. They are likely to be casual or competitive athletes who have recently increased their training intensity. Pain increases with activity and diminishes with a period of rest. Tendon rupture occurs when sudden forces are exerted upon the Achilles during strenuous activities that involve sudden pivoting on a foot or rapid acceleration. Patients may hear a &quot;pop&quot; and experience severe acute pain, although the absence of pain does not rule out rupture. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examination should include palpation of the Achilles tendon for tenderness, thickening, or a defect. Note that edema or a hematoma may mask a defect in the tendon. Patients with tendinopathy typically have localized tenderness 2 to 6 cm above the insertion point of the Achilles tendon. Pain at the insertion point suggests calcaneal bursitis or possibly enthesopathy. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The calf squeeze (ie, Thompson compression) test provides an accurate means for detecting complete Achilles tendon rupture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74412\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74412 \">picture 3</a>). A sizable minority of patients with complete tendon rupture are able to ambulate. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Achilles tendinopathy (without rupture) is a clinical diagnosis. Imaging is not generally necessary. Plain radiographs are generally unhelpful. Musculoskeletal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are accurate tests that can be used to aid in the diagnosis of Achilles tendon rupture. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment and prevention</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All complete tendon ruptures merit surgical consultation. Partial tendon tears and chronic tendinopathy that fail to improve with three to six months of conservative treatment may benefit from consultation with a specialized runners' clinic, sports medicine specialist, physical therapist, or orthopedic surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Indications for referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute Achilles tendinopathy is treated in standard fashion with rest, ice, and tendon support. For chronic midportion tendinopathy (&gt;3 months symptoms), we suggest using a rehabilitation program that emphasizes resistance exercise using heavy loads (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61034\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61034 \">table 5</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Exercise programs and other possible interventions for chronic Achilles tendinopathy are discussed in the text. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Acute tendinopathy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Chronic tendinopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that tendon rupture be treated with surgical repair (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). This suggestion applies to active patients who place a high value on regaining preinjury levels of activity and are willing to accept a higher rate of treatment complications. Inactive patients and those unwilling to accept higher complication rates may opt for nonoperative management. Percutaneous surgical repair may reduce postoperative wound infection rates compared with open repair. Postoperatively and in patients who opt for nonsurgical management, early mobilization and functional rehabilitation improve function and quality of life without impairing healing. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Tendon rupture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several interventions may reduce the risk of developing lower extremity injuries, including Achilles tendinopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity#H58496913\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of running injuries of the lower extremity&quot;, section on 'Training suggestions to reduce injury risk'</a> and <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3558492527\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We are saddened by the death of Peter Ham, MD, who passed away in January 2017.
