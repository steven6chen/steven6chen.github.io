The basic biologic features of <em>R. rickettsii</em> and how it produces disease will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations of RMSF and its treatment are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Rocky Mountain spotted fever&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TAXONOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like other gram-negative bacteria, <em>R. rickettsii</em> is a member of the alpha-group of purple bacteria. It is a member of the order Rickettsiales and the family Rickettsiaceae. The family Rickettsiaceae, in turn, contains the genera <em>Rickettsia</em> and <em>Orientia</em>. The genus <em>Rickettsia</em> is divided into the typhus and spotted fever groups.</p><p><em>R. rickettsii</em> is the prototype of the spotted fever group, which has more than 12 separate pathogenic species (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Other spotted fever group rickettsial infections&quot;</a>). Phylogenetic studies utilizing the 16S ribosome have shown that <em>R. rickettsii</em> is closely related to other members of the spotted fever group such as <em>Rickettsia conorii</em> and <em>Rickettsia sibirica</em>, whereas its phylogenetic relationship to other spotted fever members such as <em>Rickettsia akari</em>, <em>Rickettsia australis</em>, and <em>Rickettsia belli</em> is substantially more distant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>R. rickettsii</em> is a weakly gram-negative non-motile coccobacillus measuring 0.3 to 0.7 mcm by 0.8 to 2.0 mcm. <em>R. rickettsii</em> are difficult to see in tissue without special stains, but they can be visualized using Giemsa, Machiavello, and Gimenez staining and by the use of direct fluorescent antibody staining techniques.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrastructure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>R. rickettsii</em> has ribosomes and a single circular chromosome located in an amorphous cytosol surrounded by a plasma membrane. In addition, an indistinct microcapsular layer is present on the outer surface of the cell wall. An electron-lucent zone separates this layer from the host cytosol. This zone is thought to represent a slime layer which may be important in pathogenicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth and survival characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>R. rickettsii</em> is an obligate intracellular parasite that cannot be propagated on cell-free media. It can be grown in vitro in the yolk sac of developing chicken embryos, but it is more conveniently cultured on primary or established cell culture monolayers, such as chicken embryo fibroblasts, mouse L cells, and golden hamster cells. Like all members of the spotted fever group, <em>R. rickettsii</em> proliferates by binary fission and grows in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of host cells. When inside host cells, <em>R. rickettsii</em> resides directly in the cytosol or nucleus rather than being surrounded by a host cell membrane.</p><p><em>R. rickettsii</em> has the curious ability to spread from cell to cell by traversing cell membranes without causing obvious damage. Individual rickettsial organisms exit from infected cells via host cell filopodia and rarely accumulate in large numbers inside individual cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. <em>R. rickettsii</em> moves between cells at astonishing speeds (up to 4.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/minute)</span> by recruiting and polymerizing host cell actin filaments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Studies using real-time polymerase chain reaction techniques to quantitate the levels of rickettsial DNA in patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) revealed a diurnal variation in the amount of rickettsial DNA in the bloodstream of infected patients, with higher levels in the early morning hours when body temperatures are lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, copy numbers of rickettsial DNA in the blood were higher in patients with fatal outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>R. rickettsii</em> largely depends on the host cell for its nutritional needs. <em>R. rickettsii</em> lacks enzymes for sugar metabolism lipid and nucleotide synthesis and amino acid metabolism. Numerous specialized adaptations allow <em>R. rickettsii</em> to exist as an intracellular parasite. These include the ability to acquire host ATP using a rickettsia-derived ATP translocator protein, and the ability to utilize host-derived glutamine as an energy source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, <em>R. rickettsii</em> thrives in the presence of high concentrations of potassium and proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Antigenic structure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies of the antigenic structure of rickettsiae led to the current classification of the multiple rickettsial species. A still poorly understood cross-reacting surface antigen is responsible for the Weil-Felix reaction in which sera from patients with a primary rickettsial infection cross-react with somatic antigens of three strains of Proteus (OX19, OX2, and OXK) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Other antigens have been developed for complement fixation, agglutination, indirect hemagglutination, indirect fluorescent antibody, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever#H630755\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever&quot;, section on 'Serologic testing'</a>.)</p><p>Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the rickettsial cell membrane elicit a strong but nonspecific immune response. Such antibodies are not protective and they cross-react with other members of the spotted fever group and to a lesser extent with LPS from members of the typhus group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">BASIS FOR VIRULENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individual strains of <em>R. rickettsii</em> can mutate in vitro from highly virulent to relatively avirulent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Virulence can vary strikingly among strains, but is also affected by the feeding status of the tick, inoculum dose, and certain host factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Strain variations in virulence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No satisfactory biologic explanation has been made to explain a number of curious observations about striking variations in the virulence of individual strains of <em>R. rickettsii</em>. Except for limited information on rickettsial adhesions, other rickettsial virulence factors have not yet been identified. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It was noted almost 100 years ago that the mortality rate in RMSF was over 80 percent in the Bitterroot Valley of Montana, versus only 3 percent in the adjacent Snake River Valley. However, the etiologic agent appeared to be identical when isolated from patients in both locations and injected into laboratory animals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individual strains of <em>R. rickettsii</em> isolated from ticks vary in virulence, but isolates made from humans with fulminant and mild disease appear to be identical when injected into laboratory animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Attempts to correlate laboratory growth characteristics (such as plaque morphology) with pathogenicity in animal models of infection have been unsuccessful or inconclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Tick feeding status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal vector of RMSF in the eastern and south central United States is <em>Dermacentor variabilis</em> (the American dog tick) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71719\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71719 \">picture 1</a>). In contrast, <em>Dermacentor andersoni</em> (the Rocky Mountain wood tick) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68829\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68829 \">picture 2</a>) is the primary vector in the mountain states west of the Mississippi River. The common brown dog tick (<em>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</em>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72221\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72221 \">picture 3</a>) was implicated as the vector for RMSF in an outbreak during 2002 to 2004 in eastern Arizona [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The disease is usually transmitted via a tick bite.</p><p>The virulence of <em>R. rickettsii</em> strains in ticks is dependent upon the feeding status of the individual tick. The virulence of <em>R. rickettsii</em> in over-wintered or starved ticks is restored only after the ingestion of a blood meal or after incubation at 37&ordm;C for one to two days. The mechanism for this &quot;reactivation&quot; phenomenon is uncertain but it may be related in part to the size of extracellular slime layer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose of inoculum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dose of the inoculum is an additional important virulence factor in humans. Humans inoculated with ten median guinea pig infectious doses of <em>R. rickettsii</em> had shorter incubation periods, longer duration of fever after institution of anti-rickettsial treatment, and higher attack rates than subjects inoculated with one median infectious dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following inoculation from a feeding tick, the process by which rickettsiae gain entry into endothelial cells involves a complex interaction between lipopolysaccharides and rickettsial outer membrane proteins (rOmps), as well as other surface-exposed proteins (SEPs), which act as adhesions. The 190 kDa and 120 kDa rOmps and several additional SEPs are also immunogens capable of eliciting protective immune responses in experimental animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/1,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11</a>].</p><p>OmpB binds to a protein (Ku70) in the membrane of susceptible host cells. Subsequently, this activated Ku70 protein recruits an enzyme (ubiquitin ligase) that causes ubiquitination of Ku70. Endothelial cellular processes are normally modulated by the ubiquitous second messenger cAMP, which in turn acts upon the cAMP receptors protein kinase A and an exchange protein called Epac. These Epac exchange proteins may also be involved in the pathogenesis of rickettsial infection as treatment with specific inhibitors of Epac protect experimental animals after challenge with lethal doses of spotted fever group rickettsiae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Additionally, in vitro and animal model studies have found that spotted fever group rickettsia also utilize cell surface heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and fibroblast growth factor receptors to facilitate their cellular invasion in a manner similar to that used by other intracellular pathogens, such as <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The complex interactions discussed above provoke a signaling cascade that causes the rearrangement of cellular actin and allows the cell to engulf the rickettsia via endocytosis results from [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Once inside cells, rickettsiae utilize two enzymes (phospholipase D and tlyC) to lyse the phagosomal membrane and escape into the cytosol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. <em>R. rickettsii</em> then express a series of other proteins that lead to polymerization of host cell monomeric actin filaments in the cytoplasm, which allows for invagination of host cell membranes and passage into neighboring cells via filopodia derived from host cell membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/1,4,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,17,18</a>]. <em>R. rickettsii</em> subsequently spread throughout the body via the bloodstream or lymphatics.</p><p>The mechanism by which <em>R. rickettsii</em> produces its characteristic damage to small blood vessels is not known. <em>Rickettsia</em> do not secrete exotoxins and they can kill infected cells independent of any host immune response. Cell injury and death has been associated with phospholipase A activity, protease activity, and free radical-induced lipid peroxidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The primary mode of rickettsia-induced cell death is cell necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Infected cells can also be eliminated by immune effector mechanisms, such as CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte induced apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The net effect of these processes is endothelial cell injury, which is followed by immune and phagocytic cellular responses via the local accumulation of lymphocytes and macrophages, resulting in a lymphohistiocytic vasculitis.</p><p>Widespread rickettsii-induced vasculitis leads to minute foci of hemorrhage, increased vascular permeability, edema, and the activation of humoral inflammatory and coagulation mechanisms. Leakage of fluid from the bloodstream to tissue can have devastating results when the lung or brain are involved, since both sites lack lymphatic vessels to remove interstitial fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Although <em>R. rickettsii</em> and other spotted fever group rickettsial infections induce a procoagulant state, disseminated intravascular coagulation is rare in patients with RMSF. Thus, vascular thrombosis and hemorrhage that results in widespread organ dysfunction is probably a physiological result of widespread endothelial denudation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Host factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of host factors have been associated with an increase in severity of or fatal RMSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male gender</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency</p><p/><p>Black race and alcohol have also been associated with more severe disease and higher fatality, but it is difficult to exclude the role of a delay in seeking or receiving antimicrobial therapy in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H447311960\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Rickettsia rickettsii</em> are gram negative bacteria that are a member of the order Rickettsiales and the family Rickettsiaceae.
