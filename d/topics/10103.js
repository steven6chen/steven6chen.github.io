The body needs potassium to work normally. It keeps the heart beating and helps the nerves and muscles work. But people need only a certain amount of potassium. Too much or too little potassium in the body can cause problems.</p><p>Having too much potassium in the blood is called &quot;hyperkalemia.&quot; This can cause heart rhythm problems and muscle weakness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4130452\"><span class=\"h1\">Who might need to be on a low-potassium diet?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People usually need to be on a low-potassium diet to treat or prevent hyperkalemia.</p><p>The most common causes of hyperkalemia are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain medicines &ndash; Some medicines, including certain ones for high blood pressure and heart problems, might raise the level of potassium in the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney disease &ndash; Normally, the kidneys filter the blood and remove excess salt and water through urination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 1</a>). They keep the level of potassium in the blood normal. When the kidneys don't work well or stop working, they can't get rid of the potassium in the urine. Then, too much potassium builds up in the blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many people who get a treatment called &quot;dialysis&quot; for kidney disease need to be on a low-potassium diet. Dialysis is a treatment that takes over the job of the kidneys.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4130490\"><span class=\"h1\">What does eating a low-potassium diet involve?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost all foods have potassium. So the key is to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choose foods with low levels of potassium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F81516\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81516 \">table 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid or eat only small amounts of foods with high levels of potassium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58250\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58250 \">table 2</a>)</p><p/><p>Your doctor will probably recommend that you work with a dietitian (food expert) to help plan your meals. He or she will tell you how much potassium you should eat each day.</p><p>To figure out how much potassium you are eating, you will need to look at the food's nutrition label (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F85761\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85761 \">figure 2</a>). You will need to look at the:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Potassium&quot; number &ndash; This tells you how much potassium is in 1 serving of the food. If you eat 1 serving, then you are eating this amount of potassium.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Serving size&quot; &ndash; This tells you how big a serving is. If you eat 2 servings, then you are eating 2 times the amount of potassium listed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4130568\"><span class=\"h1\">What are other ways to cut down on potassium?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Here are some other ways to cut down on potassium:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drain the liquid from canned fruits, vegetables, or meats before eating.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you eat foods that have a lot of potassium, eat only small portions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce the amount of potassium in the vegetables you eat. You can do this for both frozen and raw vegetables. (If the vegetables are raw, peel and cut them up first.) To reduce the amount of potassium, soak the vegetables in warm unsalted water for at least 2 hours. Then drain the water and rinse the vegetables in warm water. If you cook the vegetables, cook them in unsalted water.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4130583\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-and-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dialysis and diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperkalemia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hyperkalemia (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-potassium-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Low-potassium diet (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
