In this procedure, a cannula is introduced through the femoral artery and advanced to the ostium of the ophthalmic artery. Chemotherapy (typically <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">melphalan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">carboplatin</a>, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topotecan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">topotecan</a>) is then delivered into the ophthalmic artery over approximately 30 minutes in a pulsatile fashion. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia, and nasal decongestant (vasoconstrictor) is typically sprayed in the nostril on the treatment side to shunt the blood away from the nasal mucosa in attempt to reduce local side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinoblastoma-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Successful OAC requires a high degree of specialized skill, and it should be performed at centers experienced in this procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are no prospective trials comparing OAC with other treatment modalities in patients with retinoblastoma. It is generally believed that compared with systemic chemotherapy, which rarely cures intraocular retinoblastoma by itself, OAC may achieve higher drug levels in the eye and therefore theoretically has the potential to increase cure rates for advanced disease. It is important to note, however, that systemic chemotherapy is typically combined with local consolidative techniques (cryotherapy and photocoagulation), which improves cure rates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The evidence for the efficacy and safety of OAC comes largely from case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinoblastoma-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/23-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-29</a>]. In a systematic review and meta-analysis that included 12 case series reporting outcomes in 655 patients (747 eyes) treated with OAC, globe salvage was achieved in 66 percent overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinoblastoma-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The globe salvage rate was 86 percent in eyes with less advanced disease (ie, groups A, B, and C) compared with 57 percent in advanced disease (ie, groups D and E). Primary treatment with OAC was associated with a globe salvage rate of 74 percent, whereas the salvage rate was 67 percent in eyes where OAC was used as secondary treatment after failure of other modalities. Metastatic disease developed in 2.1 percent of patients treated with OAC in the published series; however, through author correspondence and a social media survey, the authors of the systematic review identified nine additional patients with metastases. Secondary malignant neoplasm occurred in 2.4 percent of patients, all of whom also received external beam radiation therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Complications were common in the initial reports of OAC; however, with improvements in the technique and experience gained with it, complication rates are low (&lt;5 percent) in later reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinoblastoma-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Local adverse effects of intra-arterial chemotherapy may include eyelid edema; ptosis; loss of eyelashes; extraocular muscle dysfunction; delayed vitreous hemorrhage; potential blindness from stenosis or occlusion of the ophthalmic artery, central retinal artery, or branch retinal artery; chorioretinal atrophy; vasculopathy in ophthalmic, choroidal, and retinal vessels; and radiation exposure (from fluoroscopy); systemic side effects include iodine allergy, the risk for ischemia and hemorrhagic stroke, and bone marrow suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinoblastoma-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/21,22,30-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22,30-35</a>].

An ongoing multicenter prospective Children's Oncology Group clinical trial is evaluating the use of OAC for primary treatment of children with group D retinoblastoma, focusing particularly on the safety of this modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinoblastoma-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intravitreous chemotherapy</strong> &ndash; Intravitreal chemotherapy is commonly used in conjunction with OAC or systemic chemotherapy for treatment of recurrent or refractory vitreous seeds, and in this setting, it has a success rate that approaches 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinoblastoma-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Historically, its use was limited due to concerns for potential tumor dissemination following intravitreal penetration; however, safety enhancing techniques (eg, use of small volume doses, lowering intraocular pressure prior to the injection, sealing the injection site, irrigating the surface of the eye) have essentially eliminated any risk of tumor spread. In a 2013 systematic review of 14 studies (including &gt;1300 intravitreal injections), only a single reported case of extraocular tumor spread was identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinoblastoma-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Untreated retinoblastoma is a deadly disease. Prompt referral to an ophthalmologist and appropriate management by a multidisciplinary team are necessary to optimize visual outcome and survival. (See <a href=\"#H4063193209\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3658557994\" class=\"local\">'Multidisciplinary approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of retinoblastoma is aimed at achieving the following goals (see <a href=\"#H1475564894\" class=\"local\">'Goals'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Eradication of the disease to prevent mortality</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Preservation of vision to the greatest extent possible</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prevention of late sequelae, particularly subsequent neoplasms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First-line therapeutic options include local and systemic chemotherapy, cryotherapy, laser photocoagulation, and enucleation. The choice of initial treatment is based on the tumor size and location, presence or absence of vitreous or subretinal seeds, patient age, and the visual prognosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F108702\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108702 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H190419708\" class=\"local\">'Treatment approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overall five-year survival rate for children with retinoblastoma in the United States is &gt;95 percent. Patients who develop metastatic disease usually do so within one year of diagnosis; a child who remains recurrence free for five years after diagnosis is considered cured. (See <a href=\"#H2778895556\" class=\"local\">'Survival'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis for vision in bilaterally affected children depends upon the extent of tumor involvement; the prognosis is better for tumors that are small, do not involve the fovea, and have limited retinal detachment and seeding. (See <a href=\"#H1749461074\" class=\"local\">'Vision'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survivors of heritable retinoblastoma have a lifelong increased risk of second malignancy, most commonly osteogenic and soft tissue sarcomas. The risk of secondary malignancy appears to be greatest among patients treated with radiation therapy before the age of one year. (See <a href=\"#H1157807156\" class=\"local\">'Second malignancies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term follow-up for patients with retinoblastoma includes monitoring for tumor recurrence and following for long-term treatment-related complications. The risk period for extraocular spread after successful treatment or enucleation is 12 to 24 months. In addition to routine ophthalmologic follow-up, many centers perform screening with brain magnetic resonance imaging (including images through the pineal region) every six months until age three to five in children with heritable retinoblastoma to screen for development of a midline primitive neuroectodermal tumors.
