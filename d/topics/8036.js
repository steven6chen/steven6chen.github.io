Most often, heat stroke happens when people exercise in very hot and humid weather without drinking enough fluids. But heat stroke can also happen in people who are not exercising. It is especially likely to affect older people and people who have health problems, so they need to be extra careful in hot conditions.</p><p>Heat stroke is a medical emergency that needs to be treated quickly. That's because heat stroke can lead to death if it is not treated quickly.</p><p>When people get too hot, they can also get &quot;heat cramps&quot; and &quot;heat exhaustion.&quot; These conditions are not as serious as heat stroke, but they can lead to heat stroke if they aren't treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11692962\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of heat stroke?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with heat stroke have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A body temperature of 104&deg;F (40&deg;C) or higher</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain symptoms &ndash; These can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Confusion or trouble thinking clearly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Seeing or hearing things that aren't real (called &quot;hallucinating&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trouble walking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Seizures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Passing out</p><p/><p>Heat stroke can also cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fast breathing or a fast heartbeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin redness and warmth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting or diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle cramps or weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headaches</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11692977\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you or someone you are with has heat stroke, get medical help right away. <strong>In the US and Canada, you should call 9-1-1 for an ambulance</strong>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11692992\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for heat stroke?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor will do an exam and take your temperature. He or she will probably do other tests to check if the heat stroke hurt other organs in your body. These tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest X-ray</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in your heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11693014\"><span class=\"h1\">How is heat stroke treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main treatment involves cooling your body down. Your doctor can do this in the hospital in different ways.</p><p>Your doctor will also treat any other problems the heat stroke has caused.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11693029\"><span class=\"h1\">Can heat stroke be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. When it is hot or humid out, you can do the following things to prevent heat stroke:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try not to be too active, and take breaks when you exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink enough fluids, such as water or sports drinks, so you do not feel thirsty. But don't force yourself to drink very large amounts in a short time, and don't drink so much that you feel uncomfortable. This can be harmful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do any exercise early in the day, before it gets too hot out.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear loose, lightweight clothes. Don't wear too many layers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid being in a hot car.</p><p/><p>You should also watch for symptoms of heat cramps or heat exhaustion. Heat cramps cause painful muscle cramps. Heat exhaustion can cause headaches, dizziness, nausea, or vomiting. It can also make you thirsty or tired.</p><p>If you have symptoms of heat cramps or heat exhaustion, you should cool your body down right away to avoid getting heat stroke.</p><p>To cool your body down, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spray yourself with cool water and then sit in front of a fan.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Move into the shade, or go into an air-conditioned building or car.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a cool shower or bath.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink water or a sports drink. Do <strong>not</strong> have a drink with alcohol or caffeine.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take off any extra clothing you are wearing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put a cold pack or cool cloth on your neck or armpit.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11006194\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dehydration-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dehydration in children (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
