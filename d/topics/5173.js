The widespread use of ART has led to a significant decline of opportunistic infections, including <em>T. marneffei</em> infection in highly endemic areas. However, despite the widespread availability of ART, <em>T. marneffei</em> infection continues to cause considerable morbidity and mortality in AIDS patients who are unaware of their HIV infection, who do not have access to ART, or who have a suboptimal response to HIV therapy.</p><p>The diagnosis and treatment of <em>T. marneffei</em> will be reviewed here. The mycology, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of <em>T. marneffei</em> are discussed elsewhere.

Talaromycosis typically occurs in patients who are severely immunocompromised (eg, those with AIDS); however, cases have also been reported in those with other underlying conditions (eg, autoimmune disorders, cancer, diabetes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-talaromyces-penicillium-marneffei-infection/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

However, given the need for early treatment, a presumptive diagnosis can be made by demonstrating the characteristic morphologic findings of this fungus in biopsy material or in blood smears of patients with fungemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58588\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58588 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-talaromyces-penicillium-marneffei-infection/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>]. <em>T. marneffei (</em>formerly<em> P. marneffei) </em>appear as oval or elongated yeast-like organisms with a clearly defined central septum. The presence of a centrally located transverse septum (eg, &quot;cross wall&quot;) differentiates <em>T. marneffei</em> from <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71699\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71699 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-talaromyces-penicillium-marneffei-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>T. marneffei</em> can be readily isolated from various clinical specimens. Cultures of bone marrow and lymph node biopsies are the most sensitive, followed by cultures of skin lesions and blood (including conventional blood culture systems) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62907\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62907 \">table 1</a>). <em>T. marneffei</em> has also been isolated from cultures of stool, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and joint fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-talaromyces-penicillium-marneffei-infection/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p>The organism typically takes about four to seven days to grow; however, on occasion, growth can take a few weeks to occur. Fungal cultures at 25&ordm;C on Sabouraud dextrose agar demonstrate characteristic features that include a flat green surface and underlying deep red coloring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76600\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76600 \">picture 3</a>). Microscopically, the fungus has typical filamentous reproductive structures of the genus <em>Penicillium</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F78922\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78922 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p>Before confirming that an isolate is <em>T. marneffei, </em>mold-to-yeast conversion must be demonstrated. This can be achieved by subculturing the fungus onto brain-heart-infusion agar and incubating it at 37&ordm;C. Alternative methods for confirming the diagnosis are through a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-hybridization assay that can be used to rapidly identify the organism that has been grown in culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-talaromyces-penicillium-marneffei-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], or an exoantigen test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-talaromyces-penicillium-marneffei-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]<em>. </em>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-talaromyces-penicillium-marneffei-infection#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of Talaromyces (Penicillium) marneffei infection&quot;, section on 'Mycology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the proper epidemiologic setting, a presumptive diagnosis of <em>T. marneffei</em> infection can be made several days before the cultures are positive by visualizing the organism. The organism can be identified through microscopic examination of any of the following: Wright-stained samples of blood or bone marrow; touch smears of skin or lymph node biopsies; or Giemsa stained bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-talaromyces-penicillium-marneffei-infection/abstract/1,8,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,12,13</a>]. </p><p>Wright-stained samples show intracellular and extracellular basophilic, spherical, oval, and elliptical yeast-like organisms. Some of these cells have a clearly defined central septum, which is a characteristic feature of <em>T. marneffei</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58588\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58588 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79630\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79630 \">picture 5</a>). The cell wall and the cytoplasm of <em>T. marneffei </em>cells cannot be seen well with hematoxylin-eosin staining of tissue sections. Thus, methenamine silver or periodic-acid Schiff (PAS) staining is preferred, and the organisms appear as unicellular round to oval cells within macrophages or histiocytes. Extracellular elongated or sausage-shaped cells with one or two septa may also be seen.</p><p>Descriptions of the histologic appearance of <em>T. marneffei</em> include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study of liver biopsies from 30 HIV-infected patients with disseminated <em>T. marneffei</em> infection, histopathological findings were classified into one of three patterns: diffuse, granulomatous, and mixed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-talaromyces-penicillium-marneffei-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The first pattern showed a diffuse infiltration of foamy macrophages that contained numerous <em>T. marneffei </em>organisms.
