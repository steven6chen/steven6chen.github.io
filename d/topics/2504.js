Creatinine is derived from the metabolism of creatine in skeletal muscle and from dietary meat; it is released into the circulation at a relatively constant rate and has a stable plasma concentration. Like inulin, creatinine is freely filtered across the glomerulus and is neither reabsorbed nor metabolized by the kidney. However, tubular secretion by the organic cation secretory pathways in the proximal tubule accounts for approximately 10 to 20 percent of urinary creatinine in patients with a normal GFR and a progressively higher percentage as the GFR falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calculation-of-the-creatinine-clearance/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The net effect is progressive overestimation of the GFR with more severe disease. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Increased creatinine secretion'</a> below.) </p><p>If the effect of secretion is ignored, then all of the filtered creatinine (equal to the product of the GFR and the serum creatinine concentration [SCr]) will be excreted (equal to product of the urine creatinine concentration [UCr] and the urine flow rate or volume [V]). Thus:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;GFR x SCr &#160;= &#160;UCr x V</p></div></div><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;GFR = [UCr x <span class=\"nowrap\">V]/SCr</span></p></div></div><p>This formula is called the creatinine clearance and tends to exceed the true GFR by 10 to 20 percent or more depending upon the proportion of urinary creatinine that is derived from tubular secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calculation-of-the-creatinine-clearance/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Historically, this error was balanced by an error of almost equal magnitude in the measurement of the serum creatinine. The error in serum creatinine measurement was due to non-creatinine chromogens (such as acetone, ascorbic acid, and pyruvate) that are present in serum and contributed 10 to 20 percent of the creatinine concentration measured by older colorimetric techniques. However, national standardization of serum creatinine assays to creatinine reference materials has largely abolished this error. If a laboratory is using standardized methods, creatinine clearance measurements will consistently be 10 to 20 percent higher than GFR in patients with a normal GFR and progressive higher as the GFR falls. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Increased creatinine secretion'</a> below.)</p><p>The creatinine clearance is usually determined from a <strong>24-hour</strong> urine collection, since shorter collections tend to give less accurate results. One problem with shorter timed collections is that any retained urine would represent a larger percent of the total urine collection. In addition, creatinine excretion varies throughout the day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calculation-of-the-creatinine-clearance/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Because of these limitations and because a stable serum creatinine concentration usually reflects stable kidney function, many clinicians estimate the GFR from the serum creatinine concentration using derived estimation equations rather than a timed urine collection. The estimation equations are described in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function#H20659769\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;, section on 'Estimation equations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Errors in urine collection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An incomplete urine collection will lead to an underestimate of creatinine excretion and therefore of the GFR, while an overcollection (more than 24 hours) will lead to an overestimate of creatinine excretion and therefore of the GFR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=collection-of-a-24-hour-urine-specimen-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Collection of a 24-hour urine specimen (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The completeness of the collection can be estimated from knowledge of the normal rate of creatinine excretion, which is equal to creatinine production in the steady state. In adults under the age of 50, daily creatinine excretion should be 20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (177 to 221 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/kg)</span> lean body weight in men and 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (133 to 177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/kg)</span> lean body weight in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calculation-of-the-creatinine-clearance/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. From the ages of 50 to 90, there is a progressive 50 percent decline in creatinine excretion (to about 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in men), due primarily to a fall in muscle mass. The above patient, for example, excreted 1200 mg (10,600 micromol) of creatinine or 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/kg),</span> suggesting that the collection is probably complete. </p><p>Other methods can be used for estimating an individual's expected daily creatinine excretion. A more accurate equation, for example, incorporates weight, age, race, and sex, as well as serum phosphate if that is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calculation-of-the-creatinine-clearance/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>Estimated creatinine excretion <span class=\"nowrap\">(mg/day)</span> = 1115.89 + (11.97 x weight in kg) &ndash; (5.83 x age) &minus; (60.18 x phosphorous in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> + (52.82 if black) &ndash; (368.75 if female)</p></div></div><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16405081\"><span class=\"h3\">Example</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The creatinine clearance is calculated on two separate occasions in a patient with known renal disease and a stable weight and diet. Despite identical serum creatinine concentrations, the results from the second collection suggest that the creatinine clearance has declined by 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. However, this interpretation contrasts with the stability of the patient's weight (muscle mass), diet, and serum creatinine. Based upon the formula for creatinine clearance derived above [UCr x <span class=\"nowrap\">V/SCr],</span> the difference in creatinine clearance must be related to differences in creatinine excretion (UCr x V). There are two possible explanations: the reduced creatinine excretion in the second specimen reflects either an incomplete second collection or an overcollection in the first specimen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased creatinine secretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even with an accurate urine collection, the accuracy of the creatinine clearance as a measurement of GFR is limited by the fact that, at a normal GFR, 10 to 20 percent of creatinine excretion is derived from secretion in the proximal tubule, resulting in the creatinine clearance being 10 to 20 percent higher than the GFR. As the GFR falls, the associated reductions in creatinine filtration and excretion will result in an increase in serum creatinine, which provides the signal for enhanced creatinine secretion. The increase in secretion counterbalances the reduction in creatinine filtration so that a steady state is reestablished in which creatinine excretion is maintained at the same level as creatinine production with a slightly higher creatinine concentration than before [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calculation-of-the-creatinine-clearance/abstract/2,4,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,9-11</a>]. However, the increase in creatinine secretion will result in the creatinine clearance being a progressively greater overestimate of the GFR. </p><p>As an example, as the true GFR falls from 80 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> (as measured by the clearance of an accurate filtration marker such as inulin or radioisotopic iothalamate or DTPA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calculation-of-the-creatinine-clearance/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>], the absolute amount of secreted creatinine can rise by more than 50 percent, accounting for as much as 35 percent of urinary creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calculation-of-the-creatinine-clearance/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In this setting, creatinine excretion is much greater than creatinine filtration. As a result, calculation of the creatinine clearance from a 24-hour urine collection will represent a large overestimate of the true GFR. The net effect is that the creatinine clearance may be normal (&gt;90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> in about one-half of patients with a true GFR of 61 to 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> and one-quarter of those with a true GFR of 51 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calculation-of-the-creatinine-clearance/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Some patients with advanced disease have a creatinine clearance that exceeds the GFR by more than twofold.</p><p>As a result, all that can be concluded is that the creatinine clearance determined from an accurately timed, preferably 24-hour urine collection represents an upper limit of what the true GFR may be. As an example, a creatinine clearance of 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> indicates decreased kidney function, although the GFR may be as low as 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. Furthermore, the degree of creatinine secretion appears to vary with time, changing the creatinine clearance independent of alterations in the GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calculation-of-the-creatinine-clearance/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In some cases, the change in creatinine clearance is discordant from that of the GFR (as measured by inulin or radioisotopic clearance). Thus, the creatinine clearance can fall modestly (suggesting disease progression) at a time when the GFR is actually increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calculation-of-the-creatinine-clearance/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>].</p><p>More accurate determination of the GFR requires measurement of an exogenous substance such as inulin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iohexol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iohexol</a>, iothalamate, DTPA, or EDTA&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calculation-of-the-creatinine-clearance/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]. Inulin is the ideal filtration marker in that it is neither secreted nor reabsorbed, but inulin has not been approved for clinical use in the United States, and is expensive and difficult to handle. The other markers provide reasonable approximations of inulin clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calculation-of-the-creatinine-clearance/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16405108\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased extrarenal creatinine degradation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with advanced renal failure (serum creatinine greater than 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [530 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> extrarenal creatinine degradation is increased due, at least in part to increases in intestinal bacterial overgrowth and bacterial creatininase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calculation-of-the-creatinine-clearance/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

In one study of 16 patients with underlying renal insufficiency, 400 mg of cimetidine was given as an oral priming dose followed by 200 mg every three hours; both the creatinine and inulin clearances were measured every three hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calculation-of-the-creatinine-clearance/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The ratio of the creatinine to inulin clearance at baseline was about 1.5 (range 1.14 to 2.27), indicating substantial creatinine secretion.

Because of this adaptive response, the GFR falls very little in mild kidney disease, and measurement of the creatinine clearance or use of an estimation equation will fail to detect the presence of disease. Mild kidney disease may be detectable by abnormal findings in the urinalysis, such as hematuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteinuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Intraglomerular hypertension and glomerular hypertrophy'</a>.) </p><p>Renal transplant donors who acutely lose half of their functioning nephrons represent a good example of this phenomenon. Despite the loss of nephrons, the GFR is approximately 70 percent of baseline at 10 to 14 days after donation and 75 to 85 percent of baseline at long-term follow-up. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-of-living-kidney-donation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk of living kidney donation&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In addition, in patients who begin with a normal GFR, mild to moderate percentage reductions in GFR produce only a small elevation in serum creatinine that may remain within the normal range and within the range of laboratory variability. As an example, a 10 to 15 percent fall in GFR will produce at most a 10 to 15 percent increase in serum creatinine. If, for example, the baseline serum creatinine is 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (71 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> the serum creatinine will only increase to 0.9 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (80 to 88 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. </p><p>These relationships have been demonstrated in a variety of disorders, including lupus nephritis and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.

(See <a href=\"#H16405048\" class=\"local\">'Example'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are several limitations to measurement of the creatinine clearance. Thus, for many patients, ascertaining whether the GFR is changing or is stable can usually be determined by monitoring the serum creatinine concentration. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Limitations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An incomplete urine collection leads to an underestimate of creatinine excretion and therefore of the GFR. The completeness of the collection can be estimated from knowledge of the normal rate of creatinine excretion. In adults under the age of 50, daily creatinine excretion should be 20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (177 to 221 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/kg)</span> lean body weight in men and 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (133 to 177 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/kg)</span> lean body weight in women. After age 50, creatinine excretion falls progressively due to a decrease in muscle mass, and may be as low as 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Errors in urine collection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The accuracy of the creatinine clearance is limited by the fact that as the GFR falls, the rise in the serum creatinine is partially ameliorated by enhanced creatinine secretion. As a result, all that can be concluded is that the creatinine clearance, assuming a complete 24-hour urine collection, represents an upper limit of the true GFR. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Increased creatinine secretion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two enhancements to the creatinine clearance measurement may provide a more accurate estimate of the GFR: measurement of the creatinine clearance during the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cimetidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cimetidine</a>; and averaging the creatinine and urea clearances in patients with a moderate to advanced decrease in kidney function. (See <a href=\"#H16405127\" class=\"local\">'Enhancing the creatinine clearance measurement'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Rose BD, Post TW.
