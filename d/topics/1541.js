It is likely that a network of interrelated brain areas is involved in the attentional-executive impairments of individuals with ADHD.</p><p>Both structural and functional imaging studies of adults, using either computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), found some evidence of structural brain abnormalities among ADHD patients that are related to the functional impairments seen in ADHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The most common findings are smaller volumes in the frontal cortex, cerebellum, and subcortical structures. Dysfunction in fronto-subcortical pathways occurs in ADHD and three subcortical structures, the caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus, which are part of the neural circuitry underlying motor control, executive functions, inhibition of behavior, and the modulation of reward pathways. These frontal-striatal-pallidal-thalamic circuits provide feedback to the cortex for the regulation of behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>ADHD-related abnormalities in reward processing and motivation may lead to lower reward anticipation, insufficient motivation, and impulsive behavior with the preference of immediate rather than delayed reward [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Preliminary studies suggest that subcortical structural abnormalities noted in childhood studies of ADHD normalize into adulthood but that cortical abnormalities persist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Because of the catecholaminergic nature of many of these brain circuits, hypoactivity of dopamine and norepinephrine in frontal-subcortical circuits underlies the brain and functional dysfunction in ADHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Noradrenaline and dopamine exert neuromodulatory influences over behavior and cognition through fronto-striato-cerebellar circuitry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. ADHD medications that block the dopamine transporter or the norepinephrine transporter increase free brain levels of noradrenaline and dopamine by blocking reuptake and triggering release. These medications are thought to target the systems to ameliorate problems with impulsivity, inattention, and hyperactivity.

Results of behavioral genetic investigations using family, twin, and adoption studies converge with those of molecular genetic studies in showing that genes influence susceptibility to ADHD. Several genes have been implicated in the etiology of ADHD, however small their effects. Polymorphisms in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1<em>, </em>SLC6A3) and the dopamine 4 (D4) receptor gene (DRD4) have been most often associated with ADHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], suggesting a complex genetic mechanism by which the disorder is caused by the combined actions of several genes interacting with environmental risk factors. A meta-analysis of 61 gene association studies, found adult ADHD to be associated with the presence of rs8079781 in BAIAP2 and with the rs8079626-rs7210438 GC haplotype. BAIAP2 is expressed at higher levels in the left human cerebral cortex and participates in neuronal proliferation, survival, and maturation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1647059637\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ADHD in adults is characterized by symptoms of inattention, impulsiveness, restlessness, executive dysfunction, and emotional dysregulation.

Only 60 children with ADHD continued to have ADHD as young adults (17.2 percent) and only 60 young adults with ADHD had the disorder in childhood (12.6 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a nationally representative birth cohort of 2232 twins born in England and Wales in 1994 to 1995, results from logistic regressions indicated that individuals with late-onset ADHD showed fewer externalizing problems and higher IQ in childhood compared with a group with persistent ADHD from childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. At age 18 years, however, those with late-onset ADHD demonstrated comparable ADHD symptoms and impairment as well as similarly elevated rates of mental health disorders.</p><p/><p>Another study found that most patients who were initially identified through screening to have late-onset ADHD were found on more thorough assessment to be false positives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The study analyzed data from longitudinally administered psychiatric assessments of 239 patients in the local normative comparison group of the Multimodal Treatment Study of ADHD from mean ages of 9.9 to 24.4 years old. Approximately 95 percent of those who initially screened positive on symptom checklists for late-onset ADHD were ultimately diagnosed as having another condition.</p><p>A systemic review of adverse occupational effects of ADHD found that adults with ADHD had higher levels of unemployment compared to control groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Adults with ADHD who are employed experience workplace impairment and reduced productivity; they are also at increased risk of accidents, trauma, and workplace injuries, particularly traffic accidents. Other problems associated with adult ADHD include reduced educational achievement and increased rates of substance abuse and criminality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,35,36,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,35,36,45</a>].</p><p>Some adults present with impairment in a clinical setting only later in life when they confront new and increasingly complex tasks that characterize adulthood and that cannot be managed with their existing neuropsychological repertoire.</p><p>The domains of emotional, educational, and social adjustment follow variable courses in individuals with ADHD, ranging from poor to good. The persistence of ADHD is not associated with a uniform functional outcome but leads instead to a wide range of emotional, educational, and social adjustment outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/44,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46</a>].</p><p>The rate of comorbid psychiatric disorders in adults with ADHD tends to increase with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,47,48</a>]. As people with ADHD age, findings suggest, the likelihood of anxiety, depression, substance-use disorder, and antisocial personality disorder increases and often becomes more evident, while the underlying ADHD becomes less evident. In our clinical experience, adults with ADHD are commonly diagnosed and treated for a comorbid condition, while ADHD is often unrecognized and untreated.

The patient&rsquo;s symptoms should be persistent and severe enough to have contributed to significant psychosocial impairment. </p><p>Specific impairments should be documented, along with the age of onset of symptoms and impairments. Recall bias can affect the reliability of self-assessment, particularly with ADHD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Many adults have difficulty recalling when ADHD symptoms began. Obtaining patient history from another adult informant (eg, parent, significant other, friend) can be very useful in making a valid ADHD diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H327210215\" class=\"local\">'DSM-5 diagnostic criteria'</a> below and <a href=\"#H327207708\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The best approach to the assessment of adult ADHD may be to use a combination of a structured or semi-structured diagnostic interview along with a dimensional rating scale that provides quantitative measures of symptom severity and impairment. Neuropsychological testing may be used to complement the interview and rating scale if indicated by other cognitive deficits. (See <a href=\"#H1845510802\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in adults'</a> below and <a href=\"#H327210162\" class=\"local\">'Rating scales'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H129101522\"><span class=\"h2\">Adult manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical interview should focus on adult manifestations of ADHD.

Of 14 adult ADHD rating scales with a total of 35 validation studies, the Conners&rsquo; Adult ADHD Rating scale (CAARS) and the Wender Utah Rating Scale (short version) have more robust psychometric statistics and content validity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1064290451\"><span class=\"h3\">Conners&rsquo; adult ADHD rating scale (CAARS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CAARS is suggested for use by mental health professionals assessing patients prior to <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> over the course of ADHD treatment. Although longer than many of the available instruments and requiring a modest cost, the CAARS provides a detailed assessment of relevant symptoms and domains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The CAARS comes in formats for self-report and observer report, which provide multimodal assessments of the same behaviors and problems, and contain an identical set of scales, subscales, and indexes. CAARS forms are available in long, short, and screening versions. The reliability and validity of the CAARS-S are satisfactory. Nine empirically-derived scales that help assess a broad range of problem behaviors, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Inattention/memory</span> problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Impulsivity/emotional</span> lability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Hyperactivity/restlessness</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with self-concept </p><p/><p>A study of the ability of the CAARS to discriminate between 249 postsecondary students with carefully diagnosed ADHD and 507 clinical controls found that the overall discriminant validity of the CAARS was 69 percent, and it had an unacceptably high false positive and false negative rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. At lower prevalence rates, a high score on the CAARS displayed only a 22 percent chance of accurately identifying individuals with ADHD. As it frequently misidentifies individuals with other psychological problems as having ADHD, it should not be the sole method of diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1064290485\"><span class=\"h3\">Adult ADHD self-report scale</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For assessing adults in primary care for ADHD, the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) is a brief and practical choice. ASRS is the World Health Organization's (WHO) rating scale for adult ADHD and is designed to measure current ADHD symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,55</a>]. It consists of 18 items based on DSM-IV <span class=\"nowrap\">symptoms/criteria</span> adapted to adults with ADHD, which are measured on a five-point scale (0 = <span class=\"nowrap\">never/seldom</span> and 4 = very often). The items 1 to 9 cover the symptoms of inattention; items 10 to 18 the symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity. ASRS has normative data and information on psychometric properties are available for several populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].

These criteria are used to diagnosis ADHD in both children and adults. Changes from DSM-IV include modifications to criterion B, which now requires that several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present prior to age 12 years, versus age 7 years in DSM-IV. Some examples of ADHD symptom manifestations in adults were added to the criteria, which are described as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A.

Patients with anxiety disorders can be distracted by the focus of the disorder, which can present similarly to the distractibility seen in ADHD. In contrast to ADHD, distraction with an anxiety disorder only occurs in the presence of the focus of that disorder (eg, when the patient is experiencing obsessional thinking in OCD or is preoccupied with self-conscious ideation in social phobia). The onset of anxiety disorders may be later than the onset of ADHD in adults. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substance use disorders (SUDs) &ndash; Cognitive and behavioral impairments (poor attention, distractibility, hyperactivity) can be seen in both ADHD and in SUDs. Acute impairments in SUDs, however, occur only the context of substance use.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H299905748\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood and adolescence, often persists in adults. Many studies have found that a majority of people diagnosed with ADHD in childhood continue to meet criteria for the disorder as adults. More recent findings show that a substantial proportion of those with adult ADHD did not have the condition in childhood. (See <a href=\"#H1647059643\" class=\"local\">'Course'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidemiologic studies of adult ADHD have estimated the current prevalence to be 4.4 percent in the United States and 3.4 percent internationally; however, individual study results have varied widely. Other psychiatric disorders often co-occur with ADHD in adults, including mood and anxiety disorders, substance use disorder, and intermittent explosive disorder. (See <a href=\"#H1647059625\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H327207679\" class=\"local\">'Comorbidity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinically significant impairments in neuropsychological functioning have been found in some studies of adults with ADHD, although those with adult-onset ADHD may be much less likely to show impaired neuropsychological function and impact on IQ compared with adults who had childhood-onset ADHD. No specific deficit or group of deficits is pathognomonic for the disorder. Impairment has been shown on neuropsychological measures of vigilance, perceptual-motor speed, working memory, verbal learning, and response inhibition. (See <a href=\"#H1647059631\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ADHD in adults is characterized by symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and restlessness, resulting in functional impairment. Impairment in executive function is common. Emotional dysregulation is often seen in these patients. (See <a href=\"#H1647059637\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DSM-5 diagnostic criteria were developed to diagnose ADHD in children, and this is reflected in their content. In assessing possible ADHD in adults, the clinician should additionally ask about common adult manifestations of the disorder. (See <a href=\"#H327210215\" class=\"local\">'DSM-5 diagnostic criteria'</a> above and <a href=\"#H129101522\" class=\"local\">'Adult manifestations'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Fayyad J, De Graaf R, Kessler R, et al.
