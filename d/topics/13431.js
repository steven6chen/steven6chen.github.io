Clinicians often must decide if chronic medications should be continued in the perioperative period. Unfortunately, there are few outcome data about the majority of medications taken in the perioperative period.</p><p>This lack of medical evidence is reflected by the large variation in perioperative management recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The recommendations in this review are to a large degree expert opinion, based on information from other reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>] and textbooks, along with clinical experience and theoretic considerations.</p><p>This topic will focus on medications known to have perioperative effects, those known to interact with anesthetic agents, and those in common use.

Medication use reported by the patient should be verified (medication reconciliation) to address accuracy of drugs and doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This should include all over-the-counter and <span class=\"nowrap\">herbal/complementary</span> medications, as well as prescription drugs. In addition, substance use information (including alcohol, nicotine, and illicit drugs) should be elicited.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications associated with known medical morbidity if withdrawn abruptly should be continued in the perioperative period or tapered if feasible. Intravenous, transdermal, or transmucosal medicines should be substituted when absorption will be impaired because of loss of gastrointestinal function or restrictions on oral intake. Medications thought to increase the risk of anesthetic or surgical complications and not essential for the short-term should be held through the perioperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other medications can be discontinued or continued based upon clinician judgment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The many medications administered perioperatively during a relatively short period increase the potential for drug-drug interactions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The metabolism and elimination of medications and their metabolites may be altered during the perioperative period. In particular, gastrointestinal absorption of oral medications may be impaired due to changes in splanchnic blood flow and edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For elective surgery, preoperative planning and care should be optimized to reduce risk and minimize the need for acute changes in medication management perioperatively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62659\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62659 \">table 1</a>). For example, we suggest control of clinical signs of heart failure (HF) for one week or longer preoperatively if time permits. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-heart-failure-in-patients-undergoing-noncardiac-surgery#H27556629\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of heart failure in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery&quot;, section on 'Intraoperative hemodynamic monitoring'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-heart-failure-in-patients-undergoing-noncardiac-surgery#H694557425\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of heart failure in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery&quot;, section on 'Preoperative management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Beta blockers</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Benefit/risk</strong></span> &ndash; Beta blockers have a number of potential beneficial effects when taken perioperatively. Beta blockers reduce ischemia by decreasing myocardial oxygen demand due to increased catecholamine release. They may also help prevent or control arrhythmias. Patients who take beta blockers chronically for management of angina are at risk of ischemia with withdrawal of beta blockade. Acute withdrawal of a beta blocker pre- or postoperatively can lead to substantial morbidity and even mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Withdrawal issues are of less concern when beta blockers are used for hypertension or migraine prophylaxis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Whether to initiate beta blockers as prophylaxis for ischemia in the perioperative period in patients at increased risk for coronary disease is complex and discussed separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of cardiac risk for noncardiac surgery&quot;, section on 'Beta blockers'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Potential adverse effects of perioperative beta blockade include bradycardia and hypotension. Nonselective beta blockers can interact with epinephrine, used for infiltration anesthesia or management of intraoperative anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of cardiac risk for noncardiac surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of beta blockers&quot;, section on 'Beta blocker withdrawal'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Continue/discontinue</strong></span> &ndash; In light of the potential benefits of perioperative beta blockade, minimal adverse effects, and consequences of acute withdrawal, we recommend that beta blockers be continued in the perioperative period and continued throughout the hospital stay. The dose of the beta blocker should be closely regulated throughout the perioperative period to maintain the blood pressure and heart rate (rate-pressure product) below the patient's ischemic threshold.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Since adequate beta blockade can take weeks to achieve safely in patients with systolic heart failure, we prefer initiation of beta blockade in the preoperative period only if acute decompensated heart failure is not present and surgery can be substantially delayed. If surgery is urgent, we prefer postponing beta blockade until a later date. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-heart-failure-in-patients-undergoing-noncardiac-surgery#H694557657\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of heart failure in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery&quot;, section on 'Beta blockers'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Formulations/alternatives</strong></span> &ndash; Intravenous forms of beta blockade, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a>, should be given if the patient cannot take oral medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Esmolol</a> is also available to be used intraoperatively or in an intensive care unit (ICU) but cannot be administered on a regular hospital floor. We have a slight preference for beta 1 cardioselective beta blockers, since they are less likely to cause adverse pulmonary and peripheral vascular effects and may be associated with a lower risk of postoperative stroke. Several studies suggest that the risk of perioperative stroke may vary with the specific beta blocker used, and that metoprolol, compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a>, has been associated with a greater risk of perioperative stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, patients who are taking a nonselective beta blocker (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>) chronically do not need to be switched to a beta 1 selective agent perioperatively.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Alpha 2 agonists</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Benefit/risk</strong></span> &ndash; Although earlier smaller randomized trials suggested that centrally acting sympatholytic drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> may improve perioperative outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>], the larger POISE-2 randomized trial in 10,010 patients undergoing noncardiac surgery found that preoperative initiation of low-dose clonidine resulted in increased harm (no change in mortality or myocardial infarction but increase in clinically significant hypotension and nonfatal cardiac arrest) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A substudy of the trial also found no benefit of perioperatively administered clonidine in reducing the risk of acute kidney injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients already taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>, abrupt withdrawal of clonidine can precipitate rebound hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. This usually occurs after abrupt cessation of fairly large oral doses (eg, greater than 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> but has also been noted in patients using transdermal clonidine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=withdrawal-syndromes-with-antihypertensive-drug-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Withdrawal syndromes with antihypertensive drug therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Continue/discontinue</strong></span> &ndash; Given the possible negative consequences of withdrawal, we recommend that alpha 2 agonist drugs be continued in the perioperative period, but not initiated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Formulations/alternatives</strong></span> &ndash; Transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> is available for patients who likely will not be able to resume oral medications by 12 hours after surgery. The decision to substitute this form of therapy must be made before surgery; an equivalent dose of the transdermal preparation should be started three days prior to surgery while the oral clonidine is tapered. The persistent effect of transdermal clonidine for 24 to 48 hours after patch removal should be considered when transitioning back to the oral form.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other centrally acting sympatholytic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methyldopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methyldopa</a> or guanabenz) are rarely used today. Withdrawal from abrupt discontinuation has been reported but is less common because of their slower onset of action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. For patients unable to take oral medications perioperatively, we recommend withholding methyldopa and guanabenz and using other parenteral hypertensive agents if hypertension becomes a problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. An intravenous form of methyldopa is available in the rare cases in which abrupt stoppage appears to be leading to a withdrawal syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcium channel blockers</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Benefit/risk</strong></span> &ndash; Data are limited regarding the risks and benefits of calcium channel blockers in the perioperative setting. Small trials have shown a more stable intraoperative hemodynamic profile in patients treated with continuous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, compared with placebo, during coronary bypass surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], but these studies are not large enough to demonstrate improved outcomes. In an observational study, continued use of calcium channel blockers was associated with reduced mortality for patients undergoing cardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A meta-analysis found that use of calcium channel blockers was associated with reduced ischemia and atrial arrhythmia in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are no serious interactions between calcium channel blockers and anesthetic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A withdrawal syndrome is not typical of calcium channel blockers, although abrupt discontinuation of these drugs has been reported to cause severe vasospasm in patients undergoing coronary revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Concerns have been raised about a possible association between calcium channel blockers and an increased risk of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A randomized trial in valvular surgery patients found that, compared with placebo, patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nimodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nimodipine</a> had increased bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Reports conflict on whether there is a greater incidence of anemia in patients receiving calcium channel blockers after hip surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Two large trials in cardiac surgery patients did not find any association between bleeding risk and use of calcium channel blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Continue/discontinue</strong></span> &ndash; Despite little data regarding calcium channel blockers during the perioperative period, these agents appear safe and have theoretic benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]; data regarding bleeding risk are contradictory. Thus, we recommend that calcium channel blockers be continued in patients who are already taking them preoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Formulations/alternatives</strong></span> &ndash; Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> is available for patients who are unable to tolerate oral agents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most oral calcium channel blockers are formulated as extended release and should not be crushed for administration in enteral tubes. Short-acting calcium channel blockers are available (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>) and can be substituted with appropriate dosing interval adjustments. Short-acting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> should be avoided, however, because it can cause rapid decreases in blood pressure. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amlodipine</a> has a long washout period, and short-acting substitutes may not be necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Benefit/risk</strong></span> &ndash; The management of patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors preoperatively is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) can theoretically blunt the compensatory activation of the renin-angiotensin system during surgery and result in prolonged hypotension. Also, the effect of these drugs may be different in noncardiac and cardiac surgery as well as with general and neuraxial anesthesia. Data regarding use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in the perioperative period are inconsistent, with most studies indicating some increased risk for peri- and postoperative hypotensive episodes but little or no significant adverse effect on cardiovascular or respiratory outcomes when the medications are continued. Representative studies include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In two trials of patients undergoing vascular surgery, one involving continuing ACE inhibitors through the morning of surgery compared with stopping 12 to 24 hours earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>] and one involving continuing ARBs compared with stopping the day prior to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], patients continuing medication through the morning of surgery had significantly more episodes of hypotension requiring treatment with pressor agents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An observational cohort study of 14,687 patients (with 4802 taking either ACE inhibitors or ARBs for unspecified indications) found an association between withholding ACE inhibitor or ARB in the 24 hours before noncardiac surgery and reduced risk of a composite of 30-day all-cause death, stroke, or myocardial injury (adjusted relative risk [ARR] 0.82, 95% CI 0.70-0.96) as well as reduced risk of intraoperative hypotension (ARR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72-0.93) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

We suggest individualizing the decision to continue or discontinue ACE inhibitors based on the indications for the drug, the patient's blood pressure, and the type of surgery and anesthesia planned. Some anesthesiologists may prefer to withhold these medications on the morning of surgery based on concerns about possible hypotension. We recommend resuming these agents as soon as possible postoperatively, as failure to restart ARBs within 48 hours after surgery has been associated with increased 30-day mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-medication-management/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-heart-failure#H316650049\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for noncardiac surgery in patients with heart failure&quot;, section on 'Medications'</a>).
