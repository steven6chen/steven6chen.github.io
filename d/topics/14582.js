In addition, the factors are not part of another mental disorder (eg, unipolar major depression).</p><p>Virtually all medical illnesses are potentially affected by psychological and behavioral factors (as well as social and environmental factors, such as employment status, poverty, relationships, and neighborhood). Variation in how patients respond to medical illnesses and hospitalization appears to be due at least in part to psychological factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Hippocrates wrote that &ldquo;It is more important to know what sort of person has a disease than what sort of disease a person has&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>PFAOMC emphasizes one causal direction in the interactions between mind and body, that is, the effects of psychological factors on general medical conditions. In most patients with medical conditions, there are also effects in the other direction (ie, medical illnesses affect psychological function). </p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, assessment, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of PFAOMC. Management of PFAOMC is discussed separately.

The prevalence may be large:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonadherence is one feature of PFAOMC and several studies have found large nonadherence rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], even for cardiovascular disease and posttransplant immune suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As an example, one review found that among patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction, medication nonadherence within the first month after discharge occurred in approximately 25 to 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of general medical patients (n &gt;1500) found that irritability in the absence of any mental disorder was present in 27 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A comparable study (n &gt;800 general medical patients) found that demoralization in the absence of major depression was present in 21 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In United States private insurance billing data, PFAOMC is a more common diagnosis than conversion disorder and other somatic symptom disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p>Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions can occur at any point in the lifespan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122788\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychological and behavioral factors can affect general medical illnesses in many ways, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Promoting known risks for medical illness, including smoking, substance abuse, overuse of analgesics, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, obesity, poor sleep hygiene, and unsafe sex </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Influencing how patients respond to their symptoms, including whether and how they seek care </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effects upon the physician&minus;patient relationship and the physician&rsquo;s diagnostic and treatment decisions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reducing compliance with diagnostic recommendations, treatment, and lifestyle change</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interfering with rehabilitation through lack of motivation and poor tolerance of pain and frustration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many of the adverse effects of psychological factors upon medical illness may be amplified by social factors, including marital stress, poor social support, job strain, and disadvantaged socioeconomic status.</p><p/><p>In addition, psychological factors can directly affect pathophysiology. As an example, stress has been experimentally shown to cause myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, stress and depression are associated with several adverse effects upon the immune system, including poorer antibody response to vaccines, decreased control of latent viruses, and worse wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Psychopathology is also associated with disruptions in homeostasis, including sleep architecture, other circadian rhythms, and endocrine function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122855\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The essential feature of psychological factors affecting other medical conditions (PFAOMC) is the presence of psychological factors (eg, distress) or behaviors (eg, maladaptive health behaviors such as nonadherence with assessments) that adversely affect a general medical symptom or disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The factors can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constitute a risk factor for the medical disorder (eg, smoking among patients with coronary heart disease or overeating in diabetes)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Influence the underlying pathophysiology of the medical illness (eg, marital conflict leads to angina in patients with coronary heart disease or to bronchospasm in asthma)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adversely affect either the course of illness or treatment (eg, anxiety that exacerbates asthma, or neglecting doses of insulin to lose weight)</p><p/><p>The adverse effects of PFAOMC include increased risk for suffering, disability, or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These effects can develop acutely (eg, stress-induced cardiomyopathy) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of stress (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>) or chronically (eg, time urgency, impatience, or hostility leading to hypertension).</p><p>Psychological and behavioral factors can potentially affect virtually all general medical conditions, including illnesses with well established pathophysiology (eg, coronary heart disease, cancer, or diabetes), functional syndromes (eg, migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, or fibromyalgia), or symptoms (eg, pain, fatigue, or dizziness) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H125568007\"><span class=\"h2\">Type of psychological factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many different types of psychological factors can affect general medical illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Denial </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anger</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122862\"><span class=\"h3\">Regression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regression is a partial or complete return to immature patterns of behavior, including dependency upon others. It is common for medically ill patients to regress and seek comfort, care, and release from their responsibilities. </p><p>Regression varies across a spectrum and in moderation is adaptive, because sick patients must give up some control and accept dependency upon others. This level of regression may evoke positive emotions in clinicians, such as feeling capable and needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, more pronounced regression is problematic; it is difficult to care for patients who have minimal tolerance for frustration, pain, or being alone; or are infantile, needy, continuously whining, and easily upset. Like young infants, some regressed patients are constantly making requests of clinicians and other caregivers. These patients avoid responsibility for their care and complain about its inadequacy. Other regressed patients excessively need to control their medical care; they may insist that care is provided in a specific manner, and they tend to be perfectionistic and intolerant of any (perceived or real) errors or delays in care. Regression can also take the form of entitlement, in which patients demand attention and are oblivious to the needs of other patients. </p><p>Patients who seem too comfortable in a regressed state have often received significant secondary gain during previous illnesses. Secondary gain is an external motivation for behavior. As an example, during a traumatic childhood with emotionally or physically absent or abusive parents, the care of clinicians may have been among the only experiences of nurturance and kindness received by a child. Now as an adult patient, the individual may unconsciously yearn to re-create this experience and thus regress. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122868\"><span class=\"h3\">Anxiety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anxiety occurs along a continuum that includes normal reactions as well as anxiety disorders, and can potentially affect the course and treatment of medical illness. Different patients react with widely varying concerns to the same diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and complications. Clinicians may become desensitized to patients&rsquo; experiences of serious illness and lose sight of what constitutes normal anxiety reactions. </p><p>Fear of death is frequent in the medically ill, but not necessarily in proportion to the severity of disease. Many other factors may magnify or diminish this fear (eg, previous losses, religious beliefs, personality, intractable pain, and previous treatment experiences, including witnessing other patients&rsquo; deaths). For some patients with minor illness, the fear of death can be troubling; for other patients, with severe or even terminal illness, the fear of death may be less important than other fears.</p><p>Other common forms of anxiety experienced by medically ill patients include separation anxiety (eg, fear of being alone in the hospital), fear of strangers (eg, difficulty trusting new clinicians), fear of injury to or losing control of bodily functions (eg, blindness, incontinence, or paralysis), fear of losing body parts (amputation), fear of pain, fear of losing one&rsquo;s social role and function (eg, career or family), fear of dependency upon others, and fear of closeness (eg, in paranoid patients). Patients may be aware of some fears but unaware of others. </p><p>In most diseases, some degree of anxiety is expected and adaptive because it puts the patient on alert. However, even normal anxiety may occasionally have adverse effects. As an example, immediately after an acute myocardial infarction, anxiety-associated increases in heart rate and blood pressure may be dangerous and require treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Anxiety symptoms may also aggravate asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and are associated with poorer behavioral management of diabetes and poorer glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Too little anxiety makes one vulnerable to minimizing the risks of disease and need for treatment. However, in some cases the apparent absence of anxiety is misleading, because the patient may be extremely anxious without conscious awareness of it, using defenses like denial (see <a href=\"#H122880\" class=\"local\">'Denial'</a> below) to avoid feeling overwhelmed. </p><p>Anxiety symptoms and disorders may adversely affect the course of illness in general medical disorders. A meta-analysis of seven prospective observational studies (n &gt;6700 patients with coronary artery disease), which adjusted for potential confounding factors (eg, age or history of smoking or diabetes), found that a one standard deviation increase in anxiety rating scale scores was associated with a 21 percent increase in poor outcomes (eg, mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, a prospective study followed patients with myocardial infarction (n &gt;1900) for up to three years found; after adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, age, body mass index, and prior general medical history), the analyses found that among patients with the highest level of anxiety, all-cause mortality was 78 percent higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Too much anxiety can also lead to functional impairment and poor adherence to diagnostic tests or treatment (eg, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to get a mammogram because I&rsquo;m afraid it might find something&rdquo;). Medical care is often disrupted by common health-related phobias, including fear of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Needles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dentists</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being put to sleep</p><p/><p>Anxiety can also amplify perception of pain and other aversive sensations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122874\"><span class=\"h3\">Depression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depression in the context of PFAOMC refers to depressed mood (dysphoria) or other depressive symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 1</a>), rather than a full syndrome or mental disorder (eg, unipolar major depression). Dysphoria can take the form of sadness, emptiness, hopelessness, demoralization, grief, or irritability. Different definitions of the term &ldquo;depression&rdquo; are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Definitions of depression'</a>.)</p><p>Depressive symptoms are associated with onset of general medical conditions and poor outcomes in these conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coronary heart disease</strong> &ndash; Many studies have demonstrated that depression is an independent risk factor for incident coronary heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], as well as poor outcomes in coronary heart disease, including recurrent coronary events, impaired functioning, poorer quality of life, and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stroke</strong> &ndash; A prospective community study (n &gt;6000 individuals followed for up to 22 years) found that after adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, age, blood pressure, body mass index, and smoking status), increasing levels of depression at baseline were associated with an increased risk of subsequent stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In addition, a national registry study of patients with stroke (n &gt;150,000) found that during two years post-stroke, depression occurred in 25 percent; after controlling for potential confounding factors (eg, age, sex, and general medical comorbidities), the analyses found that all-cause mortality was 89 percent greater in patients with post-stroke depression than nondepressed stroke patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diabetes</strong> &ndash; The number of depressive symptoms is related to the number of diabetic symptoms (eg, coldness, numbness or pain in the hands and feet; polyuria; and abnormal thirst) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and depressive syndromes are associated with increased rates of hyperglycemia, diabetic complications, and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. As an example, a prospective observational study followed patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for up to three years, and found that after adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, age, sex, obesity, smoking, and hemoglobin A1C), death was more likely to occur in patients with minor depression (n &gt;300) than nondepressed patients (n &gt;3300) (14 versus 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In a cross-sectional study of patients with type 2 diabetes (n &gt;700), those who were depressed were more likely to smoke, be <span class=\"nowrap\">overweight/obese,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have worse glycemic control than patients who were not depressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>End stage renal disease</strong> &ndash; Hospitalization and mortality are greater in patients with end stage renal disease who are depressed, compared with patients who are not depressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. As an example, a prospective observational study of a nationally representative sample of hemodialysis patients (n &gt;5000) found that the risk of death was 40 percent greater in depressed patients than nondepressed patients (relative risk 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis</strong> &ndash; Among patients with rheumatoid arthritis, depressive symptoms are associated with increased pain, fatigue, and disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In addition, depression is an independent risk factor for mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p>In the face of disease and disability, patients frequently feel dejected, discouraged, and helpless. When sadness becomes too great and demoralization occurs, maladaptive behaviors may ensue; depressed patients are at increased risk for nonadherence with medical treatment, smoking, substance abuse, a sedentary lifestyle, unsafe sex, and poor nutrition. Nonadherent depressed patients may appear to be passively suicidal (eg, transplant patients who deliberately miss doses of maintenance immunosuppressive drugs). Depression can amplify perception of pain and other aversive sensations. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122880\"><span class=\"h3\">Denial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Denial is conceptualized as a defense mechanism (see <a href=\"#H277728589\" class=\"local\">'Other'</a> below) that reduces anxiety by blocking conscious awareness of thoughts, feelings, or facts that are unwanted and threaten to overwhelm the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (Suppression is the conscious avoidance of upsetting knowledge.) Although denial of a general medical disease may be a symptom of a psychiatric disorder (eg, schizophrenia), denial also occurs in the absence of psychiatric syndromes. </p><p>Denial occurs often in major medical illnesses, particularly among individuals who deny other life stressors, such as marital problems. In addition, denial is frequent in patients who poorly tolerate dependency associated with medical illness, and for whom the sick role is inconsistent with how they think of themselves. </p><p>The extent of denial in patients with general medical conditions varies. Patients may deny any illness at all, or acknowledge the symptoms but deny the particular diagnosis (usually displacing it to a more benign organ system, such as interpreting angina as indigestion), or accept the diagnosis but deny the need for treatment and lifestyle change. </p><p>Severe denial, in which patients refuse to accept obvious symptoms and signs of a disease, is a defense against overwhelming fear, if no other evidence of major psychopathology (eg, paranoid delusions) is present. Extreme denial of a general medical illness may distort the perception of reality, reach psychotic proportions, and appear comparable to the gross impairment in reality testing that occurs in psychotic disorders (eg, schizophrenia or delusional disorder) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, extreme denial in psychological factors affecting other medical conditions is not regarded as a psychotic phenomenon.</p><p>Denial of a medical illness is not always pathologic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]; the adaptive value varies, depending upon the nature or stage of the illness. Excessive denial may delay diagnosis, result in nonadherence with medications and rehabilitation plans, and lead patients to ignore modifiable risk factors. However, maintaining some degree of denial in the initial response to a grave diagnosis or complication helps patients to adjust to the bad news and continue functioning without feeling overwhelmed by the full awareness of the implications of their disease. Although denial of early cancer can be maladaptive if patients delay seeking necessary treatment, denial of untreatable metastatic cancer may enhance quality of life before death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>In addition, moderate denial during treatment for acute coronary syndromes may be adaptive by reducing anxiety without preventing the patient from cooperating with clinical care.

One example is the brittle diabetic adolescent with labile blood glucose levels and frequent episodes of ketoacidosis, despite efforts by the physician to improve diabetic management. The difficulty in controlling the illness is often attributed to the patients and their dislike of lifestyle restrictions, tendency to rebel against feeling controlled by others, denial of vulnerability, and wish to be &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; In many adolescent (and some adult) diabetic patients, these psychological issues undermine management through nonadherence with medication, diet, follow-up visits, and activity limitations, as well as substance abuse. Also, some female patients with body image problems may skip insulin doses as a way to lose weight.
