SSS may also manifest as chronotropic incompetence with inappropriate heart rate responses to physiological demands during activity. SSS can also be accompanied by AV nodal conduction disturbances and by atrial tachyarrhythmias as part of the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome.

Most patients with SSS present with one or more of the following nonspecific symptoms: fatigue, lightheadedness, palpitations, presyncope, syncope, dyspnea on exertion, or chest discomfort. Symptoms are frequently intermittent with gradual progression in frequency and severity, although some patients may present with profound, persistent symptoms at the initial visit. Rarely, SSS may be asymptomatic and identified on routine ECG or ambulatory ECG monitoring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26361577\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with symptomatic SSS are primarily older and frequently have comorbid diseases. Patients with SSS often seek medical attention with symptoms of lightheadedness, presyncope, syncope, and, in patients with alternating periods of bradycardia and tachycardia, palpitations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other symptoms associated with a rapid heart rate. Patients with coexisting cardiac pathology may notice increasing dyspnea on exertion or worsening chest discomfort related to lower heart rate and the resulting reduction in cardiac output. Because symptoms may be variable in nature, nonspecific, and frequently transient, it may be challenging at times to establish this symptom-rhythm relationship.</p><p>Prior to any testing beyond an ECG, a thorough evaluation should be performed for potentially reversible causes, which include medication use (eg, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, antiarrhythmics), myocardial ischemia, systemic illness (eg, hypothyroidism), and autonomic imbalance. (See <a href=\"#H90573371\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>SSS is defined by ECG abnormalities (eg, bradycardia, sinus pauses, sinus arrest) that occur <strong>in association with</strong> clinical signs and symptoms. Of note, ECG abnormalities alone, in particular sinus bradycardia, do not always denote the presence of SSS. As an example, highly conditioned athletes often have a pronounced increase in vagal tone at rest with heart rates well below 60 beats per minute in the absence of symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26361849\"><span class=\"h2\">ECG findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of SSS in persons with suggestive symptoms is often made from the surface ECG.

However, the symptoms of SSS are nonspecific and the electrocardiogram (ECG) findings may not be diagnostic. Hence, the key to making a diagnosis of SSS is to establish a correlation between the patient's symptoms and the underlying rhythm at the time of the symptoms.</p><p>Patients may present with symptoms of fatigue, lightheadedness, presyncope, syncope, dyspnea on exertion, chest discomfort, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> palpitations. A routine ECG <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ambulatory ECG monitoring may confirm the diagnosis if typical ECG findings (eg, one or more of sinus bradycardia; sinus pauses, arrest, and sinoatrial [SA] exit block; or alternating bradycardia and atrial tachyarrhythmias) can be correlated with symptoms. In some patients, however, additional diagnostic testing may be required, and SSS should not be diagnosed until any potentially reversible causes have been identified and treated.</p><p>Our approach is as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F103295\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef103295 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comprehensive history and physical examination, resting 12-lead ECG, review of prior records and ECG tracings, and exercise stress testing &ndash; The key to making a diagnosis of SSS is establishing a symptom-rhythm correlation. Hence, a good history and ECG findings during symptoms are often sufficient to diagnose SSS. Careful review of prior records, in particular previous ECG tracings, can provide subtle clues to changes in the ECG over time. For patients with clinically suspected SSS in whom the diagnosis remains uncertain following the initial ECG, we perform exercise stress testing.<br/><br/>Exercise stress testing can aid in identifying abnormal sinus node function, excluding myocardial ischemia, and can help guide device programming for patients who ultimately receive a permanent pacemaker (eg, rate responsiveness). A subnormal increase in heart rate after exercise (ie, chronotropic incompetence) can help identify individuals with abnormal sinus node function who may benefit from a pacemaker implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. While there are various definitions on what is considered subnormal, most clinicians diagnose chronotropic incompetence as either a nontachycardic monotonic heart rate over a 24-hour period or the inability of achieving at least 80 percent of the maximum predicted heart rate with exercise testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of this latter approach, however, are uncertain, and the results obtained may not be reproducible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise ECG testing: Performing the test and interpreting the ECG results&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Careful review for potentially reversible causes and medication use should be performed to exclude remediable causes for apparent SSS. In patients with medication use (eg, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, antiarrhythmics, and acetylcholine esterase inhibitors) suspected to result in symptomatic bradycardia, the patient should remain on an ECG monitor while the medications are withdrawn. If symptoms and ECG abnormalities persist following the withdrawal of the medications (ie, after three to five half-lives), then SSS can be diagnosed. Similarly, patients with symptomatic bradycardia suspected to be due to myocardial ischemia, hypothyroidism, or another condition should receive treatment directed at that condition while ECG monitoring continues.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If SSS cannot be definitively diagnosed following history, physical, and initial 12-lead ECG, ambulatory ECG monitoring (with a continuous monitor [Holter] for 1 to 14 days <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> event monitor for up to four weeks) should be performed to identify symptomatic episodes of arrhythmias and average heart rates over extended periods of surveillance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-ecg-monitoring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory ECG monitoring&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with suspected SSS but without a confirmed diagnosis following ambulatory ECG monitoring, additional testing may include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extended ambulatory ECG monitoring with an implantable loop monitor.

In most patients, ambulatory ECG monitoring for an extended period of time (typically two to four weeks but potentially longer) has the greatest yield and allows for correlation with symptoms. In select patients where the diagnosis remains uncertain, other diagnostic testing options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> administration, carotid sinus massage, and invasive electrophysiology studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1117942113\"><span class=\"h2\">Ambulatory ECG monitoring and event recording</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with clinically suspected SSS in whom the initial ECG and monitoring are non-diagnostic, we perform additional ambulatory ECG monitoring. We most frequently use an ambulatory event monitor for two to four weeks to try to capture the ECG during a symptomatic episode. Rare patients with frequent symptoms may be successfully diagnosed with an ambulatory Holter monitor worn for 24 to 48 hours, while patients with less frequent symptoms may require extended monitoring for months to years with an implantable cardiac monitor. The introduction of the implantable loop monitor into the diagnostic armamentarium has enhanced the diagnostic yield of the clinical evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The challenge of evaluating patients with sick sinus syndrome remains the nonspecificity of symptoms, apart from syncope, and the inconsistency of electrocardiographic clues. Management requires correlation between symptoms and electrocardiographic findings. The implantable loop recorder is uniquely suited to achieve this goal and is becoming more frequently and earlier in the cascade of diagnostic tools. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-ecg-monitoring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory ECG monitoring&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ambulatory ECG monitoring with a 24-hour Holter monitor may provide important clues in 50 to 70 percent of patients with suspected SSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. However, the sensitivity and specificity of a 24-hour continuous monitor is relatively low due to the variable nature of symptoms and short duration of monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The use of cardiac event monitors, ambulatory ECG monitors which are typically worn for two to four weeks, has been shown to be more effective than 24-hour continuous monitors in establishing a diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In some instances where the symptoms are very infrequent, the use of implantable event monitors have been used that allow for monitoring periods of greater than one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Variable patient compliance and sensitivity to the adhesive electrode patches further limits the utility of two- to four-week week monitoring. The enhanced diagnostic utility of implantable loop recording has significantly reduced the role of pharmacological challenge, determining the intrinsic heart rate and invasive electrophysiological studies. The latter tests are of limited diagnostic yield lacking both sensitivity and specificity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic challenge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of drugs have been used in aiding the diagnosis of SSS, but none are used in routine clinical practice.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Atropine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoproterenol</a> &ndash; Atropine (1 or 2 mg) and isoproterenol (2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/minute)</span> may be useful, since both agents normally increase the sinus rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. A suggested abnormal response is an increase in the sinus rate of less than 25 percent, or to a rate below 90 beats per minute.

(See <a href=\"#H1117942113\" class=\"local\">'Ambulatory ECG monitoring and event recording'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom the diagnosis remains uncertain following ambulatory ECG monitoring, additional diagnostic options include the insertion of an implantable loop recorder that may last as long as three years. Pharmacologic challenge and invasive electrophysiology testing are rarely employed. Referral to a cardiac electrophysiologist should be considered.
