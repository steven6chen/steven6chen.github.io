This topic will consider all three tumor origins under the heading EOC. </p><p>EOC is the most common cause of death among women with gynecologic malignancies and the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States. Only approximately 25 percent of women will be diagnosed with early stage ovarian cancer, either confined to the ovary (stage I) or confined to the pelvis (stage II). For women with EOC confined to the ovary (IA or IB) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> well-differentiated (grade 1) tumors, prognosis is excellent with survival of at least 90 percent following surgery alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-of-early-stage-stage-i-and-ii-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-cancer/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

It is controversial whether women with grade 2 ovarian cancer should be considered as having high risk disease and offered adjuvant therapy. </p><p>The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early stage EOC has been further shown in two meta-analyses: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the first, 13 trials conducted between 1965 and 2004 were included, although only eight of these studies were performed exclusively in stage I ovarian cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-of-early-stage-stage-i-and-ii-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The pooled results for chemotherapy for women with stage I ovarian cancer showed a benefit for adjuvant treatment in terms of recurrence-free survival (Relative Risk [RR] 0.70, 95% CI 0.58-0.86) and overall survival (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58-0.94).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Five-year overall survival was improved with the use of adjuvant platinum-based therapy (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.90). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the second, five randomized trials conducted between 1990 and 2003 involving 1277 women were included in the analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-of-early-stage-stage-i-and-ii-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Again, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with benefit in terms of both progression-free survival (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52-0.84) and overall survival (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53-0.93). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women who had no gross residual following surgery, chemotherapy did not appear to improve overall survival when compared with observation (HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.63-2.37).

The ACTION study enrolled 448 women with early EOC and high risk features and randomly assigned post-surgical care to adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy versus observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-of-early-stage-stage-i-and-ii-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. While surgical treatment was not protocol mandated, the study incorporated strict definitions of optimal versus non-optimal staging. After a median follow-up of ten years, adjuvant chemotherapy resulted in the following outcomes when compared with observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-of-early-stage-stage-i-and-ii-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A significant improvement in recurrence free survival (RFS, 70 versus 62 percent, HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46-0.89) and a trend towards an improvement in cancer specific survival (CSS, 82 versus 76 percent, HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.48-1.13). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who underwent complete surgical staging, there was no significant improvement in either RFS (78 versus 72 percent, HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.38-1.42) or CSS (85 versus 89 percent, HR 1.58, 95% CI 0.61-4.08). However, for women who had incomplete surgical staging, there was a significant improvement in both RFS (65 versus 56 percent, HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41-0.87) and CSS (80 versus 69 percent, HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35-0.95). </p><p/><p>Overall, the available evidence supports the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early stage ovarian cancer with high risk features. In contrast, patients with no risk factors do not appear to benefit from chemotherapy. Further prospective clinical trials are needed to determine whether patients with one or more of these high risk features who have undergone optimal surgical staging may omit adjuvant chemotherapy. </p><p>Our approach is consistent with that of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-of-early-stage-stage-i-and-ii-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. For women with resected grade 1, stage IA or IB disease, we recommend observation alone rather than the use of adjuvant therapy. For women with high-risk disease (defined as stage IC or II, high grade or clear cell cancers of any stage), we recommend adjuvant chemotherapy. We also suggest the use of adjuvant chemotherapy for women with grade 2 tumors but acknowledge that observation, in the absence of other risk factors, is an acceptable alternative for this subgroup of patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF ADJUVANT TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1173577\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described above, adjuvant therapy is offered to women with early-stage EOC with high-risk features, typically between 21 and 35 days from primary debulking surgery, given some evidence of worsened survival with delay beyond 35 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-of-early-stage-stage-i-and-ii-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. For such women, adjuvant intravenous chemotherapy is the preferred modality. While the optimal adjuvant chemotherapy regimen is unknown, most clinicians offer treatment with a platinum-based doublet, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>, largely because of its demonstrated efficacy in the adjuvant therapy of women with advanced stage EOC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65626\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65626 \">table 1</a>).

In each of these, P 32 therapy was associated with increased toxicity without improved efficacy. In particular, P 32 therapy was complicated by problems with adequate distribution and bowel toxicity (eg, perforation). Given the effectiveness of chemotherapy, intraperitoneal P 32 has been abandoned and is no longer used in the treatment of early stage ovarian cancer. </p><p>There is a lack of consensus regarding the optimal adjuvant regimen in this setting. We prefer a platinum-based doublet (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>) largely based upon indirect evidence that it improves outcomes when administered as adjuvant therapy for more advanced disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65626\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65626 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-of-early-stage-stage-i-and-ii-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-cancer/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

Comparing six versus three cycles, five year overall survival was not significantly different among women with serous cancers (86 versus 73 percent). For women with other tumor types there was no difference in overall survival with three or six cycles (79 percent in both groups). Therefore, our approach is to treat with at least three cycles and assess the patient for tolerance to the treatment.

In these cases, women will not have undergone surgical staging and technically speaking would be considered to have apparent early but unstaged ovarian cancer. For women with unstaged apparent early EOC, we suggest staging because both prognosis and adjuvant treatment options are tied to disease stage. Often this surgery can be performed through a minimally invasive approach. Alternatively, some evidence suggests that surgery may not be required if adjuvant chemotherapy is administered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As described above, the Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Ovarian Neoplasm (ACTION) trial of adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation highlighted the importance of complete surgical staging in patients with early stage EOC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-of-early-stage-stage-i-and-ii-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

When compared with observation, maintenance paclitaxel was not associated with improvements in the five-year risk of recurrence (HR 0.807, 95% CI 0.565-1.15) or estimated rate of survival at five years (85 versus 86 percent, respectively). Grade 2 or greater adverse events were significantly increased with maintenance paclitaxel compared with observation. Given these findings, we suggest observation following adjuvant chemotherapy rather than the use of maintenance therapy for early stage EOC.

EOC is the most common cause of death among women with gynecologic malignancies and the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States. Approximately 25 percent of cases are early stage ovarian cancer, either confined to the ovary (stage I) or confined to the pelvis (stage II). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not all patients with early stage EOC require adjuvant chemotherapy. A decision to administer chemotherapy is largely based upon the stage of disease and tumor characteristics (see <a href=\"#H21075699\" class=\"local\">'Selection of patients'</a> above): &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with completely resected grade 1, stage IA or IB EOC, we recommend observation alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with high-risk EOC (defined as stage IC or II, high grade or clear cell cancers of any stage), we recommend adjuvant chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We also suggest adjuvant chemotherapy for grade 2 stage I or II EOC (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Observation is an acceptable alternative for stage I EOC provided there are no high risk factors. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When adjuvant chemotherapy is used, we suggest a platinum-based two-drug combination chemotherapy regimen rather than single agent therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> for six cycles. We recognize that the benefit of six cycles may be limited to women with serous cancers or women with stage II disease. It is reasonable to individualize the number of cycles based upon patient risk factors and the tolerance of therapy. In this case, we prefer a minimum of three cycles be administered. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Duration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following adjuvant chemotherapy, we suggest observation rather than maintenance chemotherapy given the lack of an overall survival benefit associated with maintenance therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1173719\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combination intraperitoneal and intravenous chemotherapy is experimental for women with early stage ovarian cancer and should be reserved for clinical trials. (See <a href=\"#H1173790\" class=\"local\">'Intraperitoneal chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The finding of early-stage EOC is occasionally made during surgery for an emergent (eg, torsion) or a benign (ie, ovarian cystectomy) indication. For these women with unstaged apparent early EOC, we suggest surgical staging because both prognosis and adjuvant treatment options are intimately tied to disease stage (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). Any patient who elects not to undergo staging should receive adjuvant chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H112932639\" class=\"local\">'Unstaged patients'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We agree with the posttreatment surveillance recommendations from expert panels, such as the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.
