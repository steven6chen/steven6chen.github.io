However, when surgery is delayed, contraindicated, or unsuccessful, medical therapy is often required. Adrenal enzyme inhibitors are the most commonly used drugs, but adrenolytic agents, drugs that target the pituitary, and glucocorticoid-receptor antagonists also have been used.</p><p>The pharmacologic management of hypercortisolemia in Cushing's syndrome will be reviewed here. An overview of the treatment options for Cushing's syndrome and additional details about drugs that inhibit cortisol synthesis are discussed separately.

The first is a &ldquo;block and replace&rdquo; strategy in which the goal is total ablation of cortisol secretion, with the addition of replacement glucocorticoid therapy when cortisol levels are extremely low. The second is a &ldquo;normalization&rdquo; strategy in which the goal is to reduce cortisol levels to normal. The &ldquo;block and replace&rdquo; strategy is almost always needed in patients with wide variability in cortisol production and urinary free cortisol (UFC) because attempts to normalize cortisol secretion with an invariant treatment will result in over- and under-suppression on different days. Conversely, the normalization strategy works best in patients with relatively invariant hypercortisolism. Thus, it is important to collect sufficient basal urine cortisol results to judge the extent of variability. Compared with the normalization approach, the block and replace approach generally requires higher doses and sometimes additional drugs, and thus is more costly and exposes the patient to the risk of additional adverse effects.</p><p>We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a> as the first drug used. Its effect can be assessed within 24 to 48 hours by measuring serum cortisol or 24-hour urine cortisol excretion and its dose adjusted frequently. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-cortisol-in-serum-and-saliva\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of cortisol in serum and saliva&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-urinary-excretion-of-endogenous-and-exogenous-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of urinary excretion of endogenous and exogenous glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ketoconazole</a> should be started at a dose of 200 mg two or three times daily and increased rapidly to 400 mg three times daily; higher doses are seldom more effective.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ketoconazole</a> requires an acidic environment for maximal absorption. The bioavailability of ketoconazole may be reduced as much as 50 percent if it is given with a proton pump inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-therapy-of-hypercortisolism-cushings-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Most patients show near-maximal responses at a daily dose of 2 g.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An alternative is the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitotane</a>, but its effects occur slowly. (See <a href=\"#H6330785\" class=\"local\">'Mitotane'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study of 11 cases of severe hypercortisolism in whom adrenalectomy was not feasible, triple drug therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitotane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a> normalized UFC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-therapy-of-hypercortisolism-cushings-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p>These drugs tend to act synergistically; using them in combination often allows one to obtain the greatest therapeutic benefit with the lowest incidence of side effects. It is seldom necessary to use maximum doses. Particularly in patients with severe hypercortisolism, it is important to control cortisol synthesis quickly. In these patients, the doses should be increased as rapidly as laboratory results are available. Patients with mild-moderate hypercortisolism may be advanced more slowly, ideally within one month.</p><p>An alternative approach is to begin treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> using the doses described above, and to add <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a> if cortisol is not adequately controlled. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mitotane</a> is rarely given as the initial agent except in patients with adrenocortical cancer. However, if the other agents cannot be used it can be used as monotherapy.</p><p>Unless <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitotane</a> is given in adrenolytic doses, these medications do not permanently cure the hypercortisolism, leading to recurrence when the drug is discontinued. As a result, they must be continued indefinitely unless a tumor is found and excised or pituitary radiotherapy is effective.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H716246889\"><span class=\"h2\">Replacement glucocorticoid therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a block and replace strategy, patients must receive replacement glucocorticoid therapy. This should be started when the serum or urine cortisol is in the normal range and the treatment doses are increased to achieve complete ablation of cortisol secretion. With steroidogenesis inhibitors, any agent can be used in the usual way (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>). If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> is used, a pre-dose cortisol level can be used to assess treatment efficacy or the patient can be placed on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> for that day.</p><p>One cannot predict when a patient will become hypocortisolemic after beginning treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitotane</a>. As a result, replacement glucocorticoid, usually 5 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or 0.5 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> each day, should be begun rapidly when increased levels of cortisol in urine or saliva begin to decrease. Mitotane increases the metabolism of dexamethasone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-therapy-of-hypercortisolism-cushings-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludrocortisone</a>, and cortisol and induces an increase in cortisol-binding globulin (CBG) levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-therapy-of-hypercortisolism-cushings-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, replacement dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> usually requires a two to three-fold increase in the usual dose after long-term therapy with mitotane. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Adjuvant mitotane'</a>.)</p><p>If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> is used for replacement therapy during <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitotane</a> administration, it may be necessary to increase its dose (and that of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludrocortisone</a>, if it is required) to three to seven times the usual dose; in these cases, amelioration of symptoms of hypocortisolism or normalization of UFC values must be used to guide glucocorticoid replacement, while symptoms and signs of volume depletion or excess (postural hypotension, systemic hypertension, or edema), serum electrolytes, and plasma renin activity are used to guide mineralocorticoid replacement.

At the outset of treatment, we recommend measurement of a morning cortisol level on the day that urine is collected for cortisol measurement. This allows the two to be correlated, with the potential later use of the morning cortisol only, as most patients find it more convenient than urine collection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For the &ldquo;normalization&rdquo; strategy, a serum cortisol target of 7 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (193 to 331 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> can be used while awaiting the urine result. This target range includes the upper part of the normal 24-hour mean cortisol values up to values slightly above normal. This approach minimizes the chance of adrenal insufficiency. Because of this possibility, patients on the normalization approach should receive education about adrenal insufficiency signs and symptoms and how to administer emergency doses of glucocorticoid.

However, aminoglutethimide is no longer available in the world market, trilostane is a very weak inhibitor, and fluconazole has rarely been used clinically; these will not be considered further. These agents (ketoconazole, metyrapone, and etomidate) are usually used in patients with corticotropin (ACTH)-dependent Cushing's syndrome. They are sometimes used in patients with adrenal cancer when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitotane</a> is not able to control hormone excess (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma&quot;</a>). Patients with benign adrenal sources of cortisol are generally treated with adrenalectomy.

Combinations of these drugs often have additive or synergistic therapeutic effects at lower individual doses, thereby minimizing side effects. The mechanism of action of the different drugs that can be used is discussed separately.

It also inhibits ACTH secretion in vitro at therapeutic doses (200 to 400 mg two or three times a day) by impairing corticotroph adenylate cyclase activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-therapy-of-hypercortisolism-cushings-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, the contribution of this effect to its action in patients with Cushing's disease has not been demonstrated.</p><p>In a large series of 200 patients with Cushing's disease treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a>, 49 percent achieved normal urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels, 26 percent had at least a 50 percent decrease, and 25 percent had unchanged UFC levels.

In men, inhibition of androgen production may lead to gynecomastia, decreased libido, and impotence. Because of this, some practitioners do not use ketoconazole as the first-line drug for men requiring long-term medical therapy of Cushing's syndrome. Others opt to use ketoconazole and replace testosterone if needed. Ketoconazole also decreases estradiol and testosterone production in women; this effect usually is not clinically apparent because of the oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea seen in most women with Cushing's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-therapy-of-hypercortisolism-cushings-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ketoconazole</a> is also a potential cause of reversible hepatotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-therapy-of-hypercortisolism-cushings-syndrome/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>].
