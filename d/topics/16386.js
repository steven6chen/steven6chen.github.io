As a result, empirical steroid therapy is given to most children who present with idiopathic NS.</p><p>However, approximately 10 to 20 percent of patients will fail to respond to initial steroid treatment. In many instances, steroid-resistant cases are due to single gene mutations that affect glomerular podocyte differentiation and function. Patients with genetic forms of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) are usually unresponsive to immunosuppressive therapy. Thus, therapeutic decisions in children with SRNS are based on the underlying etiology.</p><p>The causes and management of steroid-resistant idiopathic NS in children will be reviewed here. The etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and initial management of NS in children are discussed separately. In addition, the management of children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) is presented elsewhere.

In one study from a tertiary center of 77 consecutive children presenting with SRNS, a disease-causing mutation was identified in 8 out of the 72 families by a cost-effective mutation analysis using a high-throughput polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based microfluidic technology for 24 single-gene causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-resistant-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>].</p><p>Some have suggested that to avoid unnecessary exposure to steroid therapy, all children with a first episode of the NS prior to initiation of steroid therapy should be screened for <em>NPHS2</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-resistant-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, given that over 85 percent of children with idiopathic NS are steroid-sensitive, and only approximately one-third of steroid-resistant patients have a genetic mutation, less than 5 percent of all cases with NS would have a genetic basis for idiopathic pediatric NS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-resistant-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. As a result, we do not recommend genetic testing for all children with idiopathic NS prior to initiation of steroid therapy.</p><p>We suggest genetic testing in patients who do <strong>not</strong> respond to steroid therapy and in whom renal biopsy findings are consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic NS (eg, MCD or FSGS). Two studies reported that one-third of patients with sporadic disease were identified as having a genetic alteration associated with SRNS using next-generation sequencing analysis of target genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-resistant-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/45,130\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,130</a>].
