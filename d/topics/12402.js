However, glaucoma is more accurately defined as an optic neuropathy and may not always be associated with elevated IOP. Glaucoma can lead to optic nerve damage and consequent visual loss. Peripheral vision loss occurs first, but if glaucoma is untreated, central vision loss and complete blindness can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In infants and toddlers, additional damage to the visual system, including large refractive error, astigmatism, strabismus, and amblyopia, may occur. Early diagnosis and referral are crucial to ensuring optimal visual outcome.</p><p>An overview of the causes, presentation, and treatment of pediatric glaucoma will be presented here. Primary infantile glaucoma and glaucoma in adults are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-infantile-glaucoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary infantile glaucoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open-angle glaucoma: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The angle of the eye is the recess formed by the irido-corneal juncture. The scleral spur, trabecular meshwork, and Schwalbe's line lie within this angle. The trabecular meshwork is a fenestrated structure that transmits aqueous fluid to Schlemm's canal, from which it drains into the venous system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71234\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71234 \">figure 1</a>). When the drainage of aqueous fluid from the anterior chamber is compromised, a new steady state develops with abnormally high intraocular pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71433\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71433 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pediatric glaucoma is classified into primary and secondary types to provide a framework for the evaluation and management of individual patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56982\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56982 \">table 1</a>). Primary glaucomas are those with isolated angle malformations (trabeculodysgenesis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Primary glaucoma may have onset at birth, in the first few years of life, or later in life (congenital, primary infantile, and juvenile glaucoma, respectively). The age at which symptoms first appear probably is related to the severity of angle dysgenesis. Although congenital, infantile, and juvenile glaucoma appear to represent three points on the spectrum of one disease, juvenile glaucoma traditionally is treated as a separate entity because it has a different clinical presentation. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Juvenile glaucoma'</a> below.)</p><p>Secondary glaucoma either is acquired or related to an underlying ocular abnormality; it can occur at any age and may be present at birth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY INFANTILE GLAUCOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary infantile glaucoma is a rare disease, with onset in the first years of life. A distinction sometimes is made between glaucoma that is present at birth (true congenital glaucoma) and glaucoma that has onset in the first two to three years of life (infantile glaucoma) because the prognosis differs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The later the onset, the less severe the structural anomaly, and the more likely the glaucoma will respond to treatment. Primary infantile glaucoma is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-infantile-glaucoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary infantile glaucoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">JUVENILE GLAUCOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary glaucoma diagnosed after four to five years of age usually is referred to as juvenile glaucoma. The pathogenesis of juvenile glaucoma is similar to that of infantile glaucoma (angle dysgenesis) and the disorder sometimes is called late-onset primary infantile glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The age at which symptoms first appear probably is related to the severity of angle dysgenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Juvenile glaucoma overlaps with juvenile-onset open-angle glaucoma (JOAG), a form of glaucoma that presents in childhood to early adulthood without ocular enlargement. JOAG is commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Molecular defects causing primary open-angle glaucoma have been identified on the long arm of chromosome 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. One such molecular defect has been mapped to the trabecular meshwork-induced glucocorticoid response gene (TIGR), also known as myocilin (MYOC) on chromosome 1q23-25 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the pathogenesis of infantile and juvenile glaucoma is similar, the presenting signs and symptoms differ. The presentation of juvenile glaucoma is insidious. Patients usually are asymptomatic and optic nerve damage is occult. In contrast to infantile glaucoma patients, who present in the first few years of life when the cornea and sclera are more elastic, patients with juvenile glaucoma do not develop enlarged cornea or buphthalmos; they are much less likely to develop corneal edema with tearing and photophobia. Elevations of intraocular pressure are usually unrecognized unless optic nerve cupping (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71467\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71467 \">picture 1</a>) is noticed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Peripheral vision is affected first, and if left untreated, central vision loss and blindness may occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is usually made because of coexisting ocular or systemic disease or because of a positive family history of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Once the diagnosis is made, children and adolescents with juvenile glaucoma can be followed with intraocular pressure measurements in the office and serial automated visual field testing. The frequency of follow-up depends upon individual case severity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with infantile glaucoma, surgical intervention is the mainstay of therapy, and medications are used as an adjunct. First-line surgical options include goniotomy and trabeculotomy. Trabeculectomy, drainage devices, and cyclodestructive procedures are generally considered when first-line procedures fail. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-infantile-glaucoma#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary infantile glaucoma&quot;, section on 'Surgery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SECONDARY GLAUCOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondary glaucoma can occur in a variety of conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56982\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56982 \">table 1</a>). Some of the causes of secondary glaucoma have associated angle anomalies. In others, glaucoma may become an important complication, although it is not usually considered a primary manifestation of the disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Angle anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glaucoma occurs secondarily in several disorders that have associated angle anomalies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56982\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56982 \">table 1</a>). Detailed descriptions of many of these disorders are provided separately. (See appropriate topic reviews). Sturge-Weber syndrome, aniridia, and neural crest disorders, three of the most common disorders with secondary glaucoma, are discussed briefly below.</p><p>The pathogenesis of angle-anomaly glaucoma is similar to that of primary infantile and juvenile glaucoma. For this reason, the treatment strategies are similar. Surgical therapy is almost always necessary to control intraocular pressure (IOP) and preserve vision. Medical therapy is adjunctive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Sturge-Weber syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic triad of Sturge-Weber syndrome includes facial port-wine stain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F59124%7EDERM%2F73978\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59124 graphicRef73978 \">picture 2A-B</a>), intracranial angiomata, and glaucoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74289\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74289 \">picture 3</a>). The disorder, one of the phakomatoses, also known as encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis, has several variants. Systemic manifestations include seizures, intellectual disability (mental retardation), paresis, and cerebral calcifications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sturge-weber-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sturge-Weber syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sturge-Weber syndrome is a sporadic disorder, with only rare familial cases. Although the syndrome is rare, it is one of the more common causes of secondary glaucoma in children. Individuals with Sturge-Weber syndrome can develop glaucoma even if they do not have the classic triad [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Glaucoma has been reported in 40 to 60 percent of patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Glaucoma is most often unilateral on the same side as the port wine stain. Patients who develop glaucoma usually have port-wine stains of both the upper and lower eyelids. The risk of glaucoma is highest in the first decade of life. Approximately one-half of patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome have glaucoma at birth and present with enlargement of the globe. Occasionally, patients develop glaucoma in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Thus, continued vigilance is needed, even in patients with initially normal intraocular pressure.</p><p>The pathogenesis of the glaucoma is variable, depending upon the age of onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Most cases that present early are due to a developmental angle anomaly that is indistinguishable from that in primary infantile glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Other possible mechanisms for later-onset glaucoma include hypersecretion from an associated angioma of the choroid, elevated venous pressure associated with an episcleral hemangioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>], or a combination of these abnormalities.</p><p>As is the case with primary pediatric glaucoma, surgery is the mainstay of treatment for glaucoma in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. However, some patients can be successfully managed medically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Aniridia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aniridia is a rare congenital abnormality caused by mutations in the <a href=\"https://www.omim.org/entry/607108&amp;token=tEpDslnpc0F0kICl/z7sFUfdC7kgbt7z3sRDeh8bdypq1RopDrWi65RSjFSWAKu8&amp;TOPIC_ID=6272\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">PAX6</a> gene. The <em>PAX6</em> gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the early development of the eyes, brain, and central nervous system. The majority of cases are sporadic, with occasional familial cases. The familial cases are autosomal dominant and involve deletion of chromosome 11p13, a deletion that increases the risk of Wilms tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cytogenetic abnormalities&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The ocular manifestations of aniridia are not limited to the iris, although it is nearly always affected. The iris may be almost completely absent or have only minor changes. Other ocular manifestations include macular hypoplasia, nystagmus, optic nerve hypoplasia, glaucoma, and progressive corneal degenerative changes. Glaucoma often presents in infancy but can present at any time.</p><p>The pathogenesis of the glaucoma in aniridia is variable. A minority of patients have an anomalous angle present from birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Others form iris adhesions within the anterior chamber angle and go on to develop classic secondary angle closure glaucoma. Thus, aniridic glaucoma can result from congenital or acquired structural angle anomalies. Patients with aniridia should be regularly monitored for the development of glaucoma. Evaluation should include assessment of corneal signs (eg, edema, enlargement), examination of the optic nerve, and measurement of IOP.</p><p>The treatment of aniridic glaucoma is difficult. Goniotomy appears to be a reasonable option for patients with an open angle. Some authors have suggested prophylactic goniotomy for patients with aniridia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]; however, this is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Trabeculotomy may be best suited for patients with angle closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Anterior segment dysgenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anterior segment dysgenesis refers to developmental defects of the anterior segment and iris that result in a spectrum of ocular and systemic manifestations. These disorders were formerly known as anterior chamber cleavage syndromes or mesodermal dysgenesis, terms that should be avoided as it is now known that neural crest cells, not mesoderm, are primarily responsible for anterior segment development and that the simple concept of anterior segment &quot;cleavage&quot; may not be valid.</p><p>Anterior segment dysgenesis represents an arrest in late gestational development that may result in retained primitive endothelium, failure of the peripheral iris to migrate posteriorly, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> failure of the corneal endothelium to fully differentiate. Individual disorders within this spectrum include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior embryotoxon or anteriorly displaced Schwalbe's line</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, which includes disorders formerly known as Axenfeld anomaly, Axenfeld syndrome, Rieger anomaly, Rieger syndrome, and iridogoniodysgenesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior keratoconus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peters anomaly, a central defect in the corneal basement membrane with various degrees of adhesion of the iris and lens capsule to the central cornea</p><p/><p>Glaucoma occurs at some time in approximately 60 percent of patients with these disorders. It may occur during infancy or much later. The increased intraocular pressure appears to be related to developmental angle anomalies. Patients with anterior segment dysgenesis should be monitored regularly for the development of glaucoma. Evaluation should include assessment of corneal signs (eg, edema, enlargement), examination of the optic nerve, and measurement of IOP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Retinopathy of prematurity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a developmental vascular proliferative disorder that occurs in the incompletely vascularized retina of premature infants. It is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinopathy of prematurity: Pathogenesis, epidemiology, classification, and screening&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p>Glaucoma is a severe complication of ROP. It can occur across the spectrum of visual acuity and at any time. Between one-quarter and one-third of patients with Stage 5 ROP (complete retinal detachment) develop glaucoma as a complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Diminished visual acuity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pain (particularly in blind eyes) may suggest the diagnosis of glaucoma in patients with ROP.</p><p>The pathogenesis of glaucoma in ROP varies. Mechanisms include contraction of the retrolental membranes leading to anterior rotation of the lens-iris diaphragm and secondary angle closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>], high iris convexity, anterior iris insertion, pigment clumping in the trabecular meshwork, and the appearance of a translucent matrix in the angle structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>The treatment of glaucoma in ROP varies depending upon the underlying mechanism. Lensectomy is the preferred procedure for obliteration of angle by forward displacement of the lens-iris diaphragm. Medications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgery may be used in other cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Aphakia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who have undergone cataract surgery are at risk for developing secondary open-angle or angle-closure glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Aphakic glaucoma is the second-most common cause of glaucoma in children (after primary infantile glaucoma), accounting for 20 percent of cases of glaucoma that presented to one children's hospital during a 20-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cataract-in-children#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cataract in children&quot;, section on 'Postoperative complications'</a>.)</p><p>The prevalence of glaucoma as a complication of pediatric cataract surgery has changed as surgical techniques have evolved. Current <span class=\"nowrap\">irrigation/aspiration</span> techniques for congenital cataract surgery, coupled with mechanical anterior vitrectomy, seem to have reduced the rate of postoperative glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, the exact prevalence is not known. In one study of 137 patients who had undergone congenital cataract surgery and were followed for a mean of 9.6 years, glaucoma developed in 12 percent of the eyes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In a meta-analysis using individual patient data on 470 children who underwent cataract surgery in infancy, 80 (17 percent) developed glaucoma at a median follow-up of 4.3 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The risk was highest among patients who underwent surgery at &le;4 weeks of age. Infants with microphthalmos are also at an increased risk for the development of glaucoma. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The implantation of an intraocular lens has not been shown to decrease the incidence of glaucoma after cataract surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p>The role of corneal thickness in the management of these patients is being investigated. Many patients demonstrate abnormally thick corneas, which may artificially raise IOP measurements.</p><p>Several factors may contribute to the development of aphakic glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An underlying anterior segment defect that contributed to the development of congenital cataract</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subclinical angle anomalies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Predisposition from the combination of cataract and microcornea</p><p/><p>Regardless of the pathogenesis, children who have undergone cataract surgery should be monitored for the development of glaucoma with periodic evaluation of the optic nerve and tonometry (in cooperative patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Most patients who develop aphakic glaucoma do so within four to six years of their cataract surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>], although it may take longer than eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Excessive loss of hyperopia (farsightedness) or corneal clouding in the aphakic patient should arouse immediate suspicion of glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p>The outcome of surgery for aphakic glaucoma is less favorable than that for primary congenital glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In contrast, aphakic glaucoma may respond to medical therapy. Thus, a trial of medical therapy usually is attempted before surgical intervention is undertaken.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraocular inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glaucoma can occur as a complication of inflammation or uveitis. The mechanism is similar regardless of age of onset: damage to and blockage of trabecular meshwork by inflammatory cells or scarring. The underlying cause of uveitis varies by age. Inflammatory glaucoma in children usually is a complication of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (formerly juvenile rheumatoid arthritis) or sarcoidosis, or is idiopathic (often of viral etiology). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uveitis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment centers on control of inflammation. Acute trabeculitis, inflammatory obstruction, and pupillary block usually respond to corticosteroids and antiglaucoma medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-infantile-glaucoma#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary infantile glaucoma&quot;, section on 'Medical therapy'</a>.) Goniotomy has been shown to be an effective procedure in children whose intraocular pressure remains elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].</p><p>Glaucoma caused by angle closure usually requires trabeculectomy or tube shunt surgery. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glaucoma can occur as a complication of ocular tumors, including retinoblastoma, medulloepithelioma, juvenile xanthogranuloma, histiocytosis X, and leukemia.

Intraocular pressure can rise rapidly to high levels, causing damage to the optic nerve and blood-staining of the cornea. Children with hyphema should be evaluated urgently by an ophthalmologist. Surgical evacuation of the blood collection may be necessary if the intraocular pressure cannot be controlled. Modest elevation of intraocular pressure usually responds to temporary medical therapy. Patients with sickle cell disease can present with significant increases in intraocular pressure with minimal hyphema. They typically do not respond well to medical management and may require early anterior chamber washout. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-hyphema-management#H714240958\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic hyphema: Management&quot;, section on 'Patients with intraocular hypertension'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-hyphema-management#H714240970\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic hyphema: Management&quot;, section on 'Surgical clot evacuation'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Steroid-induced</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Steroid-induced glaucoma is more common among adults but can occur in children. This form of glaucoma occurs most commonly in patients who use corticosteroid eye drops, although it has been observed infrequently in chronic and, to a lesser extent, acute systemic corticosteroid use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. The mechanism of steroid-induced glaucoma remains unknown. The condition usually subsides after discontinuation of steroids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;, section on 'Ophthalmologic effects'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that are traditionally characterized by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Glaucoma can lead to optic nerve damage and visual loss. Early diagnosis and referral are crucial to ensuring optimal visual outcome. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pediatric glaucoma is classified into primary and secondary types to provide a framework for the evaluation and management of individual patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56982\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56982 \">table 1</a>). Primary glaucomas are those with isolated angle malformations (trabeculodysgenesis). They may have onset at birth, in the first few years of life, or later in life. Secondary glaucoma either is acquired or related to an underlying ocular abnormality; it can occur at any age and may be present at birth. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary infantile glaucoma is a rare disease, with onset in the first years of life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-infantile-glaucoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary infantile glaucoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary glaucoma diagnosed after four to five years of age usually is called juvenile glaucoma. Patients typically are asymptomatic, and optic nerve damage is occult. Elevations of IOP usually are unrecognized unless optic nerve cupping (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71467\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71467 \">picture 1</a>) is noticed. The diagnosis generally is made because of coexisting ocular or systemic disease or because of a positive family history. Surgical intervention is the mainstay of therapy, and medications are used as an adjunct. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Juvenile glaucoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary glaucoma can occur in a variety of conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56982\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56982 \">table 1</a>). Causes of secondary glaucoma include angle anomalies (eg, Sturge-Weber syndrome, aniridia, anterior segment dysgenesis), retinopathy of prematurity, aphakia, intraocular inflammation, ocular tumors, trauma, and glucocorticoids.
