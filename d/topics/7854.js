It develops in some people who have chronically high levels of urate (also called uric acid) in their blood; urate can form urate crystals that deposit in tissues. The medical term for high blood urate levels is &quot;hyperuricemia.&quot; Not everyone with hyperuricemia develops gout; up to two-thirds of people with hyperuricemia never develop symptoms, but it is unclear why this is. In people who do have gout, the symptoms result from the body's reaction to deposits of urate crystals in tissues.</p><p>Although the joints are the most commonly affected part of the body, related crystals called uric acid crystals can form in the kidney or other parts of the urinary tract, where they can occasionally impair kidney function or cause urinary tract stones.</p><p>Gout is different from another disease called calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease (formerly called &quot;pseudogout&quot;), which is discussed separately. This other condition develops in some people in response to the presence of a different type of crystal known as a calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GOUT RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gout usually develops in adulthood and is rare in children. It commonly develops earlier in adult men (often at ages 30 to 45 years) than in women (usually after age 55) and is particularly common in people older than 65 regardless of gender. It is estimated that gout affects nearly 4 percent of adults in the United States.</p><p>There are several medical conditions and lifestyle factors that increase a person's risk of developing gout, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic kidney disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fasting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consuming excessive amounts of alcohol (particularly beer, whiskey, gin, vodka, or rum) on a regular basis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overeating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consuming large amounts of meat, seafood, or beverages containing high fructose corn syrup (such as non-diet sodas)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking medications that affect blood levels of urate (especially diuretics)</p><p/><p>In people already diagnosed with gout (referred to as &quot;established gout&quot;), there are also certain characteristics that increase the risk of repeated gout flares. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injury or recent surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fasting </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consuming excessive amounts of alcohol (wine may also be implicated as a risk for additional gout flares in people who have had prior flares)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overeating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking medications that affect blood levels of urate</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GOUT SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gout flares (also called gout attacks) are sudden episodes of severe joint pain, usually with redness, swelling, and tenderness of the joint. Although a gout flare typically affects a single joint, some people develop a few inflamed joints at the same time. Gout flares start more often overnight and in the early morning hours than during the day, but they can occur at any time. The pain and inflammation usually reach their peak intensity within 12 to 24 hours and generally improve completely within a few days to several weeks, even if untreated. It is not clear how the body &quot;turns off&quot; a gout flare.</p><p>The characteristic pain and inflammation of gout develop when white blood cells and cells in the joint linings attempt to surround and digest urate crystal deposits. These cells recognize the crystal deposits as foreign material and release chemical signals that contribute to the pain, swelling, and redness associated with a gout flare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PHASES OF GOUT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three main phases of gout: gout flare, intercritical gout, and tophaceous gout.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Gout flare</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial gout flares usually involve a single joint, most often your big toe or knee. Over time, flares can begin to involve multiple joints at once and may be accompanied by fever. People with osteoarthritis in their fingers may experience their first gout flares in the fingers rather than the toes or knees.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Intercritical gout</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The time between gout flares is known as an intercritical period. A second gout flare typically occurs within two years, and additional gout flares may occur thereafter. If your gout is untreated over a period of several years, the time between gout flares may shorten, and your gout flares may become increasingly severe and prolonged and involve multiple joints.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Tophaceous gout</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who have repeated gout flares or persistent hyperuricemia for many years can develop tophaceous gout. This term describes the accumulation of large numbers of urate crystals in masses called &quot;tophi.&quot; People with this form of gout develop tophi in joints, bursae (the fluid-filled sacs that cushion and protect tissues), bones and cartilage, or under the skin. Tophi may cause erosion of the bone and eventually joint damage and deformity (called gouty arthropathy).</p><p>Developing tophi near the knuckles or small joints of the fingers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64367\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64367 \">picture 1</a>) can be a distressing cosmetic problem. Tophi are usually not painful or tender. However, they can become inflamed and can cause symptoms like those of a gout flare.</p><p>Tophaceous gout used to be more common in the past, when treatment for hyperuricemia was unavailable. Certain groups are still at risk for tophaceous gout, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who are treated with a medication called cyclosporine after organ transplantation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those who cannot tolerate or do not receive adequate doses of medications to treat hyperuricemia (for example, due to kidney failure or drug allergy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who have already been through menopause, especially if they are taking a diuretic medication</p><p/><p>The known risk factors for gout can also contribute to the development of tophaceous gout. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Gout risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">GOUT COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with gout are at increased risk of developing kidney stones. This can happen if uric acid crystals build up in the kidney or other parts of the urinary tract. If a stone gets large enough, it can block one of the ureters (the tubes that carry urine from the kidney to the bladder and out of the body) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 1</a>). Medications that increase the amount of uric acid excreted by the kidneys, which are commonly used in people with frequent or severe gout flares, may increase the risk of developing kidney stones. The most common symptom of kidney stones is pain in the side of the back (&quot;flank pain&quot;).</p><p>Kidney stones caused by uric acid crystals occur in approximately 15 percent of people with gout. This compares with an 8 percent risk of kidney stones in people without gout. Sometimes these kidney stones also contain calcium crystals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">GOUT DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many illnesses that can cause joint pain and inflammation. Gout is strongly suspected if a person has an acute attack of joint pain, followed by a period in which there are no symptoms. It is important to confirm the diagnosis of gout to ensure that potentially harmful medications are not taken unnecessarily over a prolonged period of time.</p><p>The best way to diagnose gout is for a doctor to examine the fluid lining the affected joint (synovial fluid) under a microscope to look for urate crystals. To do this, he or she uses a needle and syringe to withdraw a small amount of fluid from inside the joint. Tophi located just beneath the skin can also be sampled with a needle to diagnose tophaceous gout.</p><p>If it is not possible to do a synovial fluid analysis, a doctor can make a tentative diagnosis of gout based on your symptoms, a physical examination, and blood tests. Among the clinical criteria for suspecting gout are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapidly developing pain and inflammation initially involving one joint at a time, especially the joint at the base of the large toe</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete resolution of symptoms between flares</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blood test showing high levels of urate (most accurate for diagnosis after a gout flare resolves)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF GOUT FLARES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of treatment of gout flares is to reduce your pain, inflammation, and the accompanying disability quickly and safely. This treatment is usually short-term and limited to the duration of the flare. Deciding which medication to use is based upon several factors, including your risk of bleeding, kidney health, and whether you have a past history of an ulcer in the stomach or small intestine. Antiinflammatory medications are the best treatment for gout flares and are best started early in the course of a gout flare.</p><p>If you have a history of gout, your doctor can give you medication to keep on hand in the event of a flare. This is important because early treatment is key in minimizing the amount of time it takes to decrease the pain, severity, and duration of a flare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H755164956\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiinflammatory steroids, also known as glucocorticoids, are effective and frequently used medications for treating gout flares. They may be given orally (as pills), by direct injection into an involved joint (called an intraarticular injection), or, in certain circumstances, by intravenous (IV) or intramuscular injection. Commonly used oral glucocorticoids include prednisone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone.</p><p>Oral glucocorticoids can be given to people with impaired kidney function or at increased risk for bleeding, as well those with multiple affected joints or who cannot take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or colchicine. Certain people are generally not candidates for glucocorticoid treatment, including those who have poorly controlled diabetes, in whom infection is a concern, or who cannot tolerate steroids for some other reason. Reducing the dose of glucocorticoids too quickly in the setting of increasingly frequent gout flares can increase your risk of a recurrent flare (called a rebound flare). In these cases, your dose of glucocorticoid should be reduced slowly over a period of at least 14 to 21 days. Your doctor will work with you to figure out how to reduce (or &quot;taper&quot;) your dose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NSAIDs work to reduce swelling in a joint and include ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), naproxen (sample brand names: Aleve, Anaprox), indomethacin (brand name: Indocin), and celecoxib (brand name: Celebrex). NSAIDs are generally recommended for people under age 65 who have no history of kidney or liver disease, have no bleeding problems, do not use anticoagulant medications such as warfarin (brand name: Coumadin), and have no history of a stomach or duodenal ulcer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>NSAIDs are most effective in the treatment of a gout flare when they are started as early as possible in the flare and when taken in higher doses than when used for minor pain relief alone (at which they have antiinflammatory, not just pain-relieving, properties). Your doctor will work with you to figure out the most appropriate NSAID dose. People who have had previous flares may start taking an NSAID at the first signs of a recurrence. NSAID treatment is stopped within a day or two of the resolution of the gout flare.</p><p>Although aspirin is an NSAID, it is not usually recommended for the treatment of gout because it can, depending upon the dose, either raise or lower urate levels in the blood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Colchicine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A medication called colchicine may be prescribed instead of an NSAID. Colchicine does not increase the risk of ulcers, has no known interaction with anticoagulants (&quot;blood thinners&quot;), and, in proper doses, does not affect kidney function. However, colchicine can have bothersome side effects when given in excess, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and crampy abdominal pain. Lower doses of colchicine than formerly used have been shown to be as effective for gout flares as the higher doses recommended in the past, and the gastrointestinal side effects have been much less of a problem. Colchicine therapy seems to be most effective when started within 24 hours of the first symptoms of a gout flare. Colchicine should be taken only as a pill. The dose of colchicine should be reduced in people with impaired kidney function. IV colchicine should be avoided because of potentially severe adverse effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">PROPHYLACTIC ANTIINFLAMMATORY GOUT THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prophylactic (preventive) antiinflammatory therapy aims to prevent or reduce the occurrence of gout flares. Colchicine is usually recommended as prophylactic therapy; it is taken daily at low doses to avoid gastrointestinal side effects. Colchicine reduces the frequency of gout flares, particularly while starting drugs that lower urate levels.</p><p>Prophylactic colchicine is not usually used alone as a long-term treatment (ie, for years), but can serve as a helpful &quot;bridge&quot; if you are transitioning from treating a gout flare to longer-term urate-lowering therapy. Although not nearly as well-studied as colchicine, daily nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are sometimes used for prophylactic therapy and may have an advantage for people who also have osteoarthritis (due to their pain-relieving properties).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG-TERM URATE-LOWERING THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapy to prevent progression of gout may include medications and lifestyle changes that can be used long-term to lower urate levels and thus prevent or reverse the urate crystal deposits that cause worsening of gout. Progressive gout can cause severe gouty arthropathy (joint damage), disability, kidney stone formation, and possibly kidney damage. People who have one or more of these complications are especially encouraged to take a urate-lowering treatment.</p><p>Not everyone with gout will require urate-lowering therapy; if you only have rare or mild flares, you may be able to manage your gout by treating the flares alone; however, if progression to joint damage or tophus development occurs, you may need urate-lowering medication. On the other hand, if you have frequent gout flares or flares that are unusually prolonged, painful, or disabling, or involve gouty joint damage or tophi, your doctor will likely suggest urate-lowering therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urate-lowering medications lower urate levels in one of three ways: they increase uric acid elimination by the kidneys; they decrease production of urate; or they convert urate to a substance called allantoin, which is more easily excreted by the body. Urate-lowering therapy is usually started after a gout flare has resolved. People who take their medication regularly and maintain urate levels below the target range over months to years eventually experience fewer flares. Doctors recommend that preventive therapy be continued indefinitely because there is no benefit to taking a break from medication.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allopurinol (brand names: Alloprim, Zyloprim) and febuxostat (brand names: Uloric, Adenuric) work by preventing the formation of urate. Allopurinol is the most commonly used drug for lowering urate levels in people with gout. Allopurinol can cause side effects, including rash, lowered white blood cell and platelet counts, diarrhea, and fever, although these problems occur in a small percentage of people. The starting dose of allopurinol needs to be reduced in people with impaired kidney function, but doses can usually be gradually increased to achieve the target urate level. No such dose-lowering concern is present with febuxostat when used at the approved doses. Periodic measurement of liver function is recommended during treatment with febuxostat and with allopurinol. Febuxostat should be used with caution in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Probenecid increases the efficiency of uric acid excretion by the kidney and is called a uricosuric drug. Benzbromarone is a more potent uricosuric drug but is not available in the United States. Both drugs can cause side effects, including rash, upset stomach, and kidney stone formation. Effective probenecid use requires two or three doses daily. Probenecid is not effective in patients with advanced kidney disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losartan (brand name: Cozaar) is used to treat high blood pressure but also has a useful, though weak, urate-lowering effect, as does the lipid-lowering drug fenofibrate. These agents can be useful adjuncts to urate-lowering treatment with allopurinol or febuxostat or with lifestyle modifications in gout patients with high blood pressure or high blood lipid levels, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesinurad (brand name: Zurampic) can be given in addition to either allopurinol or febuxostat if a person's urate levels are still too high after taking one of those drugs. Lesinurad should not be used alone; it should be prescribed along with either allopurinol or febuxostat. Lesinurad is also available as a combination pill with allopurinol (brand name: Duzallo). Lesinurad can cause side effects, including kidney problems. Close monitoring of kidney function by your doctor is needed when taking lesinurad.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pegloticase (brand name: Krystexxa) works by breaking down urate into allantoin, a substance that is more easily excreted. Pegloticase is given by repeated intravenous (IV) infusions and can lower urate levels rapidly and profoundly. This medication is expensive; may cause allergic-like infusion reactions, some of which can be severe; needs careful monitoring; and is effective in the long term in only about 50 percent of cases. For these reasons, it is recommended that pegloticase use be limited to people with advanced gout that cannot be controlled with oral urate-lowering therapies.</p><p/><p>It takes weeks or months to lower urate levels to where they should be. During this period, your doctor will gradually adjust your medication doses to meet the goal (usually a blood urate level &lt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>. Very rapid urate lowering can cause more frequent gout flares. Increased fluids are recommended during this time (generally at least two liters per day).</p><p>Antiinflammatory prophylactic therapy (with colchicine or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic antiinflammatory gout therapy'</a> above) can usually be safely discontinued when blood levels of urate are normal and have been in the goal range for about six months. Some people may need a longer period of prophylactic therapy, particularly if they have tophi. Blood levels of urate should be monitored periodically to ensure that the goal urate level is maintained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Changing your diet may reduce the frequency of gout flares. Because obesity is a risk factor for gout, as well as for many other health conditions, losing weight is an important goal. However, starvation or fad diets are not recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-treatments-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Weight loss treatments (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Changes in diet are often recommended along with urate-lowering medications. Changing your diet alone is unlikely to lower blood urate levels by more than about 15 percent, even if you make major changes to your diet. On the other hand, if you lose weight in addition to changing your diet, it is possible to see more significant improvements in urate control.</p><p>Diet guidelines for patients with established gout have changed over time, and it is not completely clear which combination of foods is best. Until validated diet guidelines for gout patients are available, a reasonable approach is to try to establish and maintain a healthy body weight with a balanced diet, and to limit your intake of alcohol and sugar-sweetened drinks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=514\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
