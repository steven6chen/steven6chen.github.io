In practical terms, almost all injections into joints consist of a glucocorticoid, a local anesthetic, or combinations of the two. Adverse outcomes from glucocorticoid injection are uncommon, but several are serious. These include iatrogenic infection and three serious types of atrophy (ie, tendon rupture, nerve damage, and inhibition of chondrocytes leading to glucocorticoid arthropathy) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74660\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74660 \">table 1</a>). The last of these is more of a theoretical than actual risk of glucocorticoid injection.</p><p>The complications of joint aspiration or injection in adults are discussed here. The technique and indications for joint aspiration and intraarticular and periarticular injections of glucocorticoids and intraarticular hyaluronate derivatives, as well as the choice and frequency of agents for injection, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint aspiration or injection in adults: Technique and indications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraarticular-and-soft-tissue-injections-what-agents-to-inject-and-how-frequently\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraarticular and soft tissue injections: What agent(s) to inject and how frequently?&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NONINFECTIOUS COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tendon rupture is most commonly encountered when undiluted glucocorticoid is injected near the rotator cuff or near the insertion of the long head of the biceps tendon. This complication may be more common with the posterior approach, which can be directed upward in the direction of the subdeltoid bursae and rotator cuff, than with the anterior approach, which is only intraarticular (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F53450\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53450 \">figure 1</a>). Tendon rupture can usually be avoided by sticking to one size of needle and syringe so as to be able to recognize the higher resistance that comes with injecting into a tendon.</p><p>Nerve atrophy or necrosis occurs when glucocorticoids enter the nerve sheath directly, an event which usually occurs only with carpal tunnel injections that come quite close to the median nerve. These injections should be performed by a subspecialist with specific training (eg, a hand surgeon or a rheumatologist). One would think that injection of the nerve would be quite painful and would, therefore, be uncommon. However, once the perineurium is pierced, the pain may be moderate and may be accompanied by a burning sensation. In the worst case, permanent nerve injury with a claw hand deformity ensues.</p><p>Other minor atrophies can also occur. These include skin atrophy, hypopigmentation, and dystrophic calcification around joint capsules. Hypopigmentation around the injection site is the most troublesome, especially on the wrist and hand of deeply pigmented individuals in whom it takes years to resolve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74337\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74337 \">picture 1</a>). Thus, such patients should be specifically advised about this complication. It may be possible to reduce the incidence of hypopigmentation by switching syringes and by flushing the needle with a small volume of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> before withdrawing it.</p><p>The risk of bleeding complications in patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation is low and is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications#H8656865\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint aspiration or injection in adults: Technique and indications&quot;, section on 'Approach to the patient on anticoagulants'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoid toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraarticular glucocorticoid injections do not appear to have measurable effects upon the rate of progression of osteoarthritis. This was illustrated in a study of 68 patients who were followed for two years; no discernible effects upon cartilage depth, either chondroprotective or destructive, were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Side effects related to systemic absorption of glucocorticoids can occur, however. Among the complications that can be seen are ecchymoses, menstrual irregularity, accelerated cataract formation, and osteoporosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and evaluation of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Two other clinically meaningful systemic metabolic effects of have been measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-complications/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis lasting from a week to two weeks after a single injection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increases in blood glucose for up to four days</p><p/><p>A rare complication, but one with major clinical implications, is osteonecrosis (ischemic or avascular necrosis of bone) from intraarticular glucocorticoids. The risk of this complication is reported to range from less than 0.1 to 3 percent of injected joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-complications/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, experience suggests that the former figure is closer to the mark, and severity of the underlying joint disease may contribute more to this risk than the injection itself.</p><p>Bone metabolism markers suggest that bone metabolism recovers completely in one to two weeks after the injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-complications/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is probably not a major concern for the majority of patients who have reasonably long intervals between their injections.</p><p>Instead, the major practical feature of glucocorticoid toxicity from joint injection is impaired blood glucose control in diabetic patients for several days after the injection, particularly if multiple injections are used. However, on average, diabetic patients suffer no decrement in blood glucose control from a single soft tissue injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-complications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Adverse effects of hyaluronate injection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a canine model of osteoarthritis, there was a significant decrease in the concentration of cartilage proteoglycan following injections of hyaluronate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-complications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This finding has raised concern that a similar effect may occur with repeated injections in humans. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraarticular-and-soft-tissue-injections-what-agents-to-inject-and-how-frequently\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraarticular and soft tissue injections: What agent(s) to inject and how frequently?&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are several short-term adverse effects of intraarticular hyaluronate injection.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each intraarticular injection carries a small risk of iatrogenic infection; this is perhaps as small as 1 in 10,000 injections as reported in some textbooks, but we have observed an incidence of approximately 1 in 2500.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute flares, termed pseudoseptic reactions, may occur in 11 percent of injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-complications/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. These reactions generally occur within one week of injection and after a follow-up injection rather than after the first injection; involve an effusion from 10 to 70 mL in volume; have nucleated cell counts of 3500 to over 100,000; and show a differential of approximately 50 to 90 percent of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In addition, the fluids are culture negative and, with a few exceptions, show no crystals. Nonbirefringent intracellular material in Wright-stained leukocytes in synovial fluid was seen in six of eight patients in one observational study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-complications/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the hylan GF-20 preparation (Synvisc), some cases of crystal-proven pseudogout have occurred two or three days after hyaluronate injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-complications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">IATROGENIC SEPTIC ARTHRITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of a septic joint is the most feared complication of joint aspiration (arthrocentesis), with or without glucocorticoid injection. The frequency of this complication is estimated to lie between 1 in 2000 and 1 in 15,000 procedures. The former number is the combined experience of one author of this topic review and a community-based practice of rheumatology; the latter estimate is the experience of the other author and the accepted textbook frequency. Although this range of estimated frequency of iatrogenic septic arthritis is broad, we suspect that the complication rate lies closer to 1 in 3000 procedures. This is based on another estimate from a nationwide study in Iceland in which data from all arthrocentesis procedures performed over a 13-year period were reviewed. The estimated frequency of septic arthritis from arthrocentesis in this large cohort was approximately 1 in 2600 procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-complications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although all needle sizes can theoretically inoculate a joint by depositing a core of tissue within the joint, translocation of bacteria seems in animal models to be correlated both with needle size and with infected tissue overlying (aspirating through cellulitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-complications/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Presumably, aspirating through cellulitis would be less of a concern if the patient has already been established on an antibiotic regimen. In addition, ultrasound guidance can assist aspiration via a less familiar route chosen to avoid cellulitis.</p><p>A septic joint must be distinguished from the more common postinjection flare. Infection should be suspected if the flare lasts longer or begins later than 48 hours after injection. The usual postinjection flare lasts hours rather than days. Other findings suggestive of an iatrogenic septic joint include a crescendo pattern of pain, redness or drainage around the injection site, and fever or malaise.</p><p>The principles of management of iatrogenic septic joints due to arthrocentesis and of management of spontaneous septic joints are identical, while the principles of primary prevention differ radically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-complications/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The major determinant of outcome in almost all clinical studies is the length of delay between the first symptom and initial drainage (the diagnostic arthrocentesis) plus antibiotic treatment. In spontaneous septic joints, the patient alone controls the length of this delay. By contrast, the clinician has the chance to educate the patient at the time of arthrocentesis and therefore can potentially control the delay in iatrogenic sepsis.
