It is caused by genetic faults in the immune system.</p><p>An overview of CMCC is given and the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of identified genetic defects leading to CMCC are reviewed here. The differential diagnosis and treatment of CMCC are also discussed. A general discussion of <em>Candida</em> infections and their clinical manifestations are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-candida-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of Candida infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candida-infections-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Candida infections in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-oropharyngeal-and-esophageal-candidiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10714495\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMCC was first described in 1929 by Thorpe and Handley [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], followed by a more extensive description in the 1950s and 1960s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. CMCC traditionally referred to a heterogeneous group of patients who suffered persistent, noninvasive <em>Candida</em> infections of the skin, mucous membranes, and nails, as well as autoimmune manifestations, most commonly involving the endocrine system. Since the discovery of autoimmune regulator (<em>AIRE</em>) mutations as a cause of CMCC, a number of other genes have been fully or partially implicated in CMCC and related clinical phenotypes including the interleukin-17 (IL-17) sensing system.</p><p>Mutations in the <em>AIRE</em> gene lead to CMCC in distinct populations, such as the Finns and Sardinians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, the majority of patients with CMCC outside of these ethnic groups do not carry mutations in this gene. Most papers related to CMCC were published prior to the discovery of AIRE, making it impossible to correlate phenotypes with the <em>AIRE</em> genotype in most publications.</p><p>Progress in techniques that will allow for genomic sequencing as well as development of novel bioinformatic models should improve our understanding of the genetic causes of CMCC. These methodologies should also unravel phenotype diversity in classical Mendelian inherited disorders, such as AIRE deficiency. Fundamental questions, such as why these patients are susceptible to infections with <em>Candida</em>, are just beginning to be answered.</p><p>CMCC can be associated with a variety of clinical features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoimmune manifestations other than endocrinopathy, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia purpura, autoimmune neutropenia, and rheumatoid arthritis, have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various degrees of bone marrow failure with aplastic anemia have been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neoplastic diseases have occurred in several patients, mostly involving the mouth and esophagus. Benign and malignant thymomas are also reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple abnormalities in the immune system are reported in patients with CMCC:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The most common is in vitro anergy of T cells to stimulation with <em>Candida</em> antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Lymphopenia and abnormal in vitro responses to mitogens have also been reported. However, these cohorts included patients with secondary immunodeficiency due to human immunodeficiency (HIV) infection, making it difficult to attribute such abnormalities to CMCC. In the cohort of patients followed by the author's group, 20 percent with non-AIRE deficiency CMCC had reduced number <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function of circulating T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections was identified in 50 percent of patients in one cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Severe lung infections and sepsis were the cause of death in some of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Patients with AIRE deficiency do not display a predisposition to bacterial and viral infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Humoral deficiencies were also reported in patients with CMCC. In one series, four patients with recurrent pulmonary infections causing chronic lung disease and bronchiectasis all had normal serum immunoglobulin levels but reduced antibody responses to immunization with polysaccharide antigens and decreased immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) and IgG4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In another series, nine patients with CMCC and recurrent infections were unable to respond adequately to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-polysaccharide-vaccine-23-valent-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. All cases reported by the author's group had no mutations in the <em>AIRE</em> gene. Two of these patients, as well as three other patients with antibody deficiency, had a lymphoid phosphatase (Lyp) mutation, and it is unclear at present how the humoral deficits segregate with the other genetic lesions.</p><p/><p>Before effective oral antifungal drugs became available, there were attempts to treat CMCC with transplantation of thymus tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>] or human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched peripheral blood leukocyte infusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. All showed limited and short-lived clinical improvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H571991\"><span class=\"h1\">AUTOIMMUNE REGULATOR DEFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autoimmune regulator (AIRE) deficiency accounts for the majority of CMCC cases in distinct populations, such as the Finns and Sardinians but only 20 to 40 percent of cases in other populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The <em>AIRE </em>gene is localized to chromosome 21q 22.3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Patients suffer chronic candidiasis as well as autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, most commonly hypoparathyroidism and adrenal insufficiency, and skin dystrophy, hence the name given to this disorder: <strong>autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED)</strong> (MIM 240300). The disorder is also referred to as autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type I (APS-I or APS1). The condition is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner and is detected at a frequency of 1:9000 in Iranian Jews, 1:14,500 in Sardinians, and 1:25,000 in Finns. More than 50 mutations have been described so far, with the most common mutation being R257X in the Finnish population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10714680\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis of AIRE deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Random rearrangement of antigen-specific receptor genes during lymphocyte maturation produces a diverse repertoire of receptors including some able to recognize the body's own antigens. To prevent autoimmunity, thymocytes expressing self-reactive T cell receptors (TCRs) are eliminated. This selection process is primarily mediated by stromal cells (macrophages, dendritic cells) in the thymus that purge the repertoire of self-reactive TCRs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A subpopulation of stromal cells, called medullary epithelial cells (MECs), express a vast spectrum of peripheral tissue autoantigens. MECs present these antigens to differentiating T cells, and only the cells that recognize the autoantigens with high affinity are clonally deleted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Expression of many of these autoantigens is regulated by the transcription factor, AIRE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Abnormal AIRE allows for forbidden T cells expressing autoreactive TCRs to expand to the periphery and induce autoimmunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>Humans and mice with a mutated <em>AIRE</em> gene suffer multiorgan autoimmunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The endocrine system is most commonly involved. The severity of the inflammation and the <span class=\"nowrap\">organs/systems</span> targeted vary with genetic background (human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-DR) in both species. As examples, HLA-DRB1*15-DQB1*0602 appears protective against type 1 diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>], while HLA-DRB1*04-DQB1*0302 is associated with alopecia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], and HLA-DRB1*DQ1*0602 is associated with adrenal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Autoimmunity in both humans and mice is associated with increased levels of autoantibodies against proteins made specifically by the affected organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. These autoantibodies may have some predictive value. However, serum from AIRE knockout mice loaded with autoantibodies was incapable of inducing autoimmunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In contrast, deletion of B cells with anti-CD20 antibody resulted in improvement of autoimmunity, suggesting that antigen presentation by B cells to T cells is critical in the pathogenesis of CMCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Autoantibodies against interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-22 were identified in the serum of patients with AIRE deficiency, suggesting that susceptibility to <em>Candida</em> infections has an autoimmune basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. One study suggested that IL-7A autoantibodies were correlated with disease severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Another study found impaired T helper cell type 17 (Th17) responses to <em>Candida</em> in patients with AIRE deficiency and other types of CMCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Further investigation is needed.</p><p>Susceptibility to candidal infection in patients with AIRE deficiency may result from both abnormal adaptive and innate immunity. Dectin-1 is a beta-glucan receptor involved in the innate immune response to candidal infection. AIRE associates with components of the Dectin-1 signaling pathway, including Dectin-1, Syk, and caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The trace constitutive association increases with stimulation of the Dectin-1 pathway, resulting in production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. TNF-alpha production after stimulation of the Dectin-1 pathway is reduced in patients with AIRE deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H572040\" class=\"local\">'Dectin-1 deficiency'</a> below and <a href=\"#H572069\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-disorders-of-phagocytic-function-an-overview#H6320403\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary disorders of phagocytic function: An overview&quot;, section on 'CARD9 deficiency'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H571998\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features of AIRE deficiency/APECED</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) is known for its wide variation in clinical presentation and course of disease, even among affected family members carrying an identical genetic aberration. In addition, the disease may present with rare manifestations that persist for many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/6,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,41,42</a>]. This clinical heterogeneity can lead to a significant delay in diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The first manifestation of the disease can start between the ages of two months to even past 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The classic triad is mucocutaneous candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism, and adrenal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic, or sometimes recurrent, candidal infection of the oral cavity, nails, and skin, and less frequently the esophagus, vagina, and gastrointestinal tract, is the presenting feature in 60 percent of patients and affects all patients by the time they are 40 years old. Skin lesions are frequently raised and sometimes disfiguring. Similarly, affected nail beds result in structurally malformed nails. These changes are probably due to a combination of infection and an exaggerated inflammatory (autoimmune) response (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F59947\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59947 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71698\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71698 \">picture 2</a>). <em>Candida albicans</em> is the most common species to cause infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoparathyroidism is the most common endocrine abnormality in this disease and the second most common feature in AIRE deficiency, occurring at presentation in approximately 30 percent of patients. More than 80 percent of patients are eventually afflicted. Hypoparathyroidism appears earlier and is more common in females than males. The resultant hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia is sometimes hard to control and may lead to seizures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adrenal failure is the third most common feature in the disease.

Pernicious anemia affects more than 20 percent of patients after the age of 30 years. Hepatitis is rare.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications presumed due to chronic <em>Candida</em> infection include keratoconjunctivitis, which may lead to blindness, esophageal stricture, and squamous cell carcinoma of the mouth and esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibody deficiency to polysaccharide antigens may occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other oral and gastrointestinal manifestations include enamel abnormalities, chronic diarrhea, and constipation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other ocular features reported include cortical lenticular opacities and chronic iridocyclitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary disease, interstitial nephritis, and encephalopathy may also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p>AIRE deficiency may also present with unusual features. Young children, even in their first year of life, may present with fever and periodic rash, dry eyes, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, or renal involvement, including hypokalemia, hypertension, or tubular interstitial nephritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8501601\"><span class=\"h1\">STAT1 DEFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH CMCC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monoallelic mutations in the coiled&ndash;coil (cc) domain of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (<em>STAT1</em>) were identified in a cohort of families with a presumed autosomal dominant inheritance of CMCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The clinical manifestations in these patients are predominantly limited to the skin, nails, and mucous membranes and rarely central nervous system vascular events. These patients tend to develop skin cancer later in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. The decreased production of interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-17, and IL-22 seen in the mononuclear cells of these patients suggests a defect in T helper cell type 1 (Th1) and Th17 responses. A proposed mechanism for these mutations is a gain of function causing impaired nuclear dephosphorylation of STAT1, which was detected in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B cells of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>Heterozygous mutations in the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of STAT1 were also reported in several patients in association with CMCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. Some of these patients suffered from sinopulmonary infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], while others had disseminated fungal infections (coccidiomycosis, histoplasmosis, and mucormycosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/51,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,53</a>] or colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. A case with fatal hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) in a patient with a mutation in the DBD was reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. One group of patients with monoallelic mutations in the DBD was reported to have declining immune function over time, leading to combined immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Their thymus glands appeared dysplastic, and they had multiple autoimmune manifestations including colitis. Patients died of overwhelming viral infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>The T385M mutation is associated with a severe phenotype and fatal outcome early in the first or second decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/50,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,55</a>]. Although STAT1 appears hyperphosphorylated (gain of function) as a consequence of a monoallelic mutation, the end result is an immunologic loss of function with decreased STAT1 expression and function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Thus, the term &quot;STAT1 dysfunction&quot; may be a more accurate description of the condition. It remains to be determined whether circulating lymphocytes from other patients with the T385M mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/46,50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,50-52</a>] also demonstrate loss of STAT1 function.</p><p>Other STAT1 mutations cause loss-of-expression and loss-of-function produce different phenotypes, such as susceptibility to mycobacterial and viral infections or combined immunodeficiency.

He had oral thrush and diaper rash resistant to topical antifungal treatment. He also had severe atopic dermatitis and developed <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> abscess and folliculitis early in infancy. In addition, he had conjunctivitis, otitis media, and respiratory infections. He did not have any hair, nail, or teeth anomalies and suffered no endocrine abnormalities. His eczema improved over time.</p><p>Another kindred in the same report was found to have multiple family members with a monoallelic change in the <em>IL17RA</em> gene. The index case had oral thrush, recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, asthma, and recurrent furunculosis during the first year of life. He too had no endocrinopathy or hair or nail changes. Two siblings with the same mutation were completely healthy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H572091\"><span class=\"h2\">Lyp mutation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor-type 22 (<em>PTPN22</em>) gene localized to 1p13 encodes Lyp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The substrates of Lyp include the kinases Lck, Fyn, Zap-70, and the CD3-zeta chain of the T cell receptor (TCR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In accordance with this observation, Lyp overexpression downregulates TCR signaling while Lyp deficiency enhances T cell activation. Lyp also interacts with the Src family negative regulatory kinase, Csk. Lyp and Csk act in tandem to negatively regulate activation of Src kinases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The interaction between Lyp and Csk is lost in the R620W mutation of Lyp since the arginine at this position is necessary for Csk-SH3 domain recognition of protein-rich areas of Lyp. This mutation is also believed to result in gain of function that alters TCR signaling, resulting in possible compromised central as well as peripheral tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>].</p><p>Six patients with CMCC who carried a R620W mutation of <em>PTPN22</em> all had oral or skin candidiasis, similar to patients with autoimmune regulator (AIRE) mutations, but none had enamel defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The most common endocrine abnormalities were hypothyroidism and gonadal failure. None had hypoparathyroidism, the most common endocrine abnormality in AIRE deficiency. A unique finding seen in five of the patients with the R620W Lyp mutant was chronic lung disease, including bronchiectasis. This is probably due to antibody deficiency in four of the six patients, another manifestation almost nonexistent in AIRE deficiency.</p><p>The R620W mutant was previously found to be associated with a variety of autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and Addison's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/64-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-71</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H572040\"><span class=\"h2\">Dectin-1 deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>C. albicans</em> is recognized by the innate immune system through pattern-recognition receptors, such as the toll-like receptors (TLRs) and lectin-like receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. TLR2, TLR4, and mannose receptors recognize mannans, <em>Candida</em> cell wall components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/57,72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,72-74</a>]. These receptors collaborate with the beta-glucan receptor Dectin-1 (MIM *606264) in stimulation of cytokine production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Dectin-1 enhances TLR2 and TLR4 induced cytokine production, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF). In its absence, mice have increased susceptibility to <em>C. albicans</em> and <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii </em>(<em>carinii</em>) infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>].</p><p>A family with Dectin-1 deficiency was identified in which affected members had a homozygous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 6 that caused a change of amino acid 238 from tyrosine to a stop codon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. These patients suffered vulvovaginitis and onychomycosis but did not have invasive candidiasis, other major infections, or autoimmune manifestations. It therefore appears that Dectin-1 deficiency leads to a pure susceptibility to mucosal and skin, but not invasive, fungal infection. However, the allelic frequency of these Dectin 1 variants are common and therefore probably represent modifying or predisposing variants rather than directly pathogenic variants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10677880\"><span class=\"h2\">Toll-like receptor 3 defect (L412F mutant)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TLR3 plays a role in initiating adaptive immune responses, suppressing autoimmune disorders, and protecting against viral infection. Fourteen patients with no identified mutations in the other genes known to cause CMCC were found to carry the TLR3 L412F mutant that renders TLR3 dysfunctional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. These patients were previously classified as a distinct clinical subgroup, CMCC with autoimmunity and combined immunodeficiency.</p><p>The one patient who was homozygous for this variant had more severe disease with treatment-resistant oral and esophageal candidiasis; cytomegalovirus (CMV)-induced hepatitis, viremia, and pneumonitis; recurrent sinopulmonary infections; chronic lung disease with bronchiectasis; and thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and neutropenia.</p><p>Patients heterozygous for the TLR3 variant all had chronic candidiasis and most had nail dystrophy, similar to other forms of CMCC. However, these patients also had severe chronic infections (mainly sinopulmonary), often leading to chronic lung disease and bronchiectasis. In addition, they had a high frequency of severe viral infections, particularly CMV, autoimmune disorders (eg, cytopenias), and endocrine abnormalities (eg, hypothyroidism). Rarely, these patients develop bone marrow failure, possibly due to CMV infections.</p><p>Immune evaluation reveals antibody deficiency as well as abnormal in vitro proliferative responses to mitogens.

The mode of inheritance appears to be autosomal dominant, but the genetic defect in this group of patients remains largely unknown. Sequence analysis of the coding region of the autoimmune regulator (<em>AIRE</em>), CD25, Dectin-1 and caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (<em>CARD9</em>) genes were normal in these patients, although some of these patients were found to have monoallelic mutations in signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (<em>STAT1) </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].

Most do not display endocrine abnormalities, except for hypothyroidism. Recurrent infections, especially pneumonia and sinusitis, are common in this group of patients, and some develop bronchiectasis over time. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin may develop, similar to patients with AIRE deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H571998\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features of AIRE deficiency/APECED'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29999189\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of CMCC is primarily based upon clinical features including chronic, noninvasive candidiasis of the skin and mucous membranes associated with autoimmune manifestations, most commonly endocrinopathies. The diagnosis can be confirmed in some cases by identifying a disease-causing mutation in the autoimmune regulator (<em>AIRE</em>) gene or signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (<em>STAT1</em>). Other patients have genetic alterations in lymphoid phosphatase (Lyp) or Dectin-1.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29999197\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with chronic candidiasis should be evaluated for primary and secondary immunodeficiencies. This should include a complete blood count with differential, immunoglobulin levels including immunoglobulin E (IgE) level, and B and T cell subsets at a minimum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory evaluation of the immune system&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with recurrent infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-recurrent-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with recurrent infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The only definitive laboratory test for the diagnosis of CMCC is the genetic analysis of the autoimmune regulator (<em>AIRE</em>) gene for disease-causing mutations. Other laboratory findings are less definitive but can aid in the diagnosis. These include standard laboratory tests to evaluate for endocrine disorders, such as hypoparathyroidism and adrenal insufficiency that are associated with CMCC. A blood count can reveal anemia, either due to iron deficiency (hypochronic, microcytic) or due to vitamin B12 deficiency (megaloblastic). Both may be caused by malabsorption and parietal cell atrophy. Liver function should also be screened because hepatitis is rarely associated with CMCC.</p><p>Evaluation of the immune system may identify a selective inability to respond in vitro (T cell proliferation) or in vivo (cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity) to <em>Candida</em>, especially in patients with AIRE deficiency. In other patients, more extensive abnormalities in in vitro antigenic and mitogenic responses are identified. Humoral immunity may also be affected, including low immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) and IgG4, hypogammaglobulinemia, and an inadequate response to vaccination with polysaccharide antigens (eg, unconjugated pneumococcal vaccine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Patients with signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) mutation in the DNA-binding domain may have a gradual decline of T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells, as well as deteriorating T cell function. They also demonstrate an inability to produce specific antibodies to immunization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. STAT1 function should be tested in freshly obtained peripheral blood lymphocytes and not in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed lines. (See <a href=\"#H8501601\" class=\"local\">'STAT1 defects associated with CMCC'</a> above.)</p><p>Serum <em>Candida</em> antibodies are not of value in the diagnosis of CMCC, nor are skin or serum IgE tests for <em>Candida</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H572069\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic candidiasis can be encountered in many types of primary immunodeficiencies. Most commonly, profound primary or secondary T cell deficiencies predispose to susceptibility to <em>Candida</em>. Patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and acquired immunodeficiency almost invariably present with oral thrush <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with other cutaneous <em>Candida</em> infections. However, unlike patients with CMCC, <em>Candida</em> infections in these disorders can become invasive with systemic spread. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-specific-defects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): Specific defects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary immunodeficiency due to underlying disease states, environmental exposures, and miscellaneous causes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-immunodeficiency-induced-by-biologic-therapies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary immunodeficiency induced by biologic therapies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Similarly, patients with caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) deficiency appear to have selective susceptibility to invasive <em>Candida</em> infection in mice and humans but do not have other features typically associated with CMCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. CD25 deficiency, a combined immunodeficiency, can cause persistent oral and esophageal candidiasis. Other conditions, such as hyperimmunoglobulin E (hyper-IgE) syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>], DOCK8 deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>], and ataxia-telangiectasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>] can also present with oral thrush, but common to all these conditions is the presence of other major clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Candidiasis was reported in a series of 35 patients with interleukin-12 receptor beta1 (<em>IL12RB1</em>) mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. In this report, 97 percent of patients studied had oral candidiasis, although few had esophageal involvement, and cutaneous lesions were rare. Unlike typical cases of CMCC, some patients had disseminated candidiasis. The majority of the individuals in this series had risk factors for candidal infections, such as antibiotic treatment for mycobacterial infections. In some of these cases, a molecular diagnosis was not obtained, making it difficult to link IL-12Rbeta with candidiasis. To a lesser degree, some patients with IL-12p40 deficiency also had either oral thrush or disseminated candidiasis in another series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].
