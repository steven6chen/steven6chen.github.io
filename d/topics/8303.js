Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is made up of organs all over the body that make and store cells that fight infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63854\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63854 \">figure 1</a>). Infection-fighting cells are also called &quot;white blood cells.&quot;</p><p>When children have lymphoma, their white blood cells become abnormal, grow out of control, and travel to different parts of the body. The abnormal cells often collect in bean-shaped organs called lymph nodes. This makes the lymph nodes swell.</p><p>Hodgkin lymphoma happens more often in teens than in younger children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8970245\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might see or feel a swollen, painless lymph node under your child's skin. Swollen lymph nodes are usually in the neck, above the collar bone, or in the armpit or groin.</p><p>Lymph nodes deeper in the body can also become swollen and cause symptoms. For example, swollen lymph nodes in the chest can cause a cough, trouble swallowing, or trouble breathing.</p><p>Other symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling very tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss or loss of appetite</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Night sweats that soak the clothes</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8970262\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for Hodgkin lymphoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will ask about your child's symptoms and do an exam. He or she will also do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lymph node biopsy &ndash; For this test, a doctor removes one of the swollen lymph nodes. Then another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope to check for cancer cells.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8970277\"><span class=\"h1\">What is lymphoma staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphoma staging is a way in which doctors find out how far the lymphoma has spread in the lymphatic system or in the body.</p><p>Hodgkin lymphoma usually starts in lymph nodes in the neck or chest. If the cancer spreads, it usually spreads to nearby lymph nodes, and then to organs such as the spleen or liver.</p><p>To check how far your child's Hodgkin lymphoma has spread, the doctor will do an exam, blood tests, and imaging tests. Imaging tests, such as CT and PET scans, create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p>The doctor might also do a bone marrow biopsy. For this test, a doctor takes a small sample of bone marrow (the tissue in the middle of your child's bones). Then another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope to check for cancer cells.</p><p>The right treatment for your child will depend a lot on the stage of his or her Hodgkin lymphoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8970292\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Hodgkin lymphoma treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. Doctors use different chemotherapy medicines to treat Hodgkin lymphoma. The doctor will work with you and your child to choose the ones that are right for your child.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells.</p><p/><p>In most cases, Hodgkin lymphoma can be cured with treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8970307\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, the doctor will check your child every so often to see if the Hodgkin lymphoma comes back. Follow-ups can include talking with the doctor, exams, blood tests, and imaging tests.</p><p>You should also watch your child for the symptoms listed above. Having those symptoms could mean the lymphoma has come back. Tell the doctor or nurse if your child has any symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8970322\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if the Hodgkin lymphoma comes back?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the lymphoma comes back, your child might have more chemotherapy, radiation, or a bone marrow transplant. In a bone marrow transplant, the doctor replaces cells in the bone marrow that are killed by chemotherapy or radiation. This is also called a &quot;stem cell transplant.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8970337\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should my child and I know about treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma can cause certain medical problems in the future.</p><p>Talk with your child's doctor about these problems, so that you know what to watch for. Your child should also be seen regularly by a doctor who will check him or her for these problems later on.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8970352\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to follow all of the doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to let the doctor know if your child has any side effects or problems during treatment.</p><p>Hodgkin lymphoma treatment can involve making many choices, such as what treatment your child should have and when.</p><p>Always let the doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time your child is offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help my child live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if my child does not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8970367\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=swollen-neck-nodes-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Swollen neck nodes in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lymphoma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lymphoma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hodgkin lymphoma in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-marrow-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone marrow transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-when-you-have-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain when you have cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-your-cancer-treatment-makes-you-tired-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When your cancer treatment makes you tired (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-loss-of-appetite-and-weight-loss-with-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing loss of appetite and weight loss with cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-with-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting with cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hair-loss-from-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hair loss from cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-care-during-advanced-illness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medical care during advanced illness (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preserving-fertility-after-cancer-treatment-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preserving fertility after cancer treatment in children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hodgkin lymphoma in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-bone-marrow-transplantation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (bone marrow transplantation) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
