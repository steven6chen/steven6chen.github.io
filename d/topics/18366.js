To maintain acid balance, these nonvolatile acids must be excreted in the urine. The hydrogen ions are excreted via a process that includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First, filtered bicarbonate must be reabsorbed since sodium or potassium bicarbonate loss is equivalent to the generation of hydrogen ions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Next, the hydrogen ions associated with the nonvolatile acid that is generated must be excreted. Only trivial amounts of free hydrogen ions can be excreted since, at a urine pH of 4.5, the free hydrogen ion concentration is less than 0.04 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. Thus, urine hydrogen ions must be bound to buffers such as phosphate (converting HPO<sub>4</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>), urate, citrate and creatinine, or ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>; converting NH<sub>3</sub> to the ammonium ion [NH<sub>4</sub>]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main adaptive renal response to chronic metabolic acidosis is to increase hydrogen ion excretion in the form of NH<sub>4</sub>. Patients who develop persistent (greater than several days) and severe metabolic acidosis may increase their NH<sub>4</sub> excretion rates from the normal value of 30 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span> (for those on a typical Western diet) to as much as 200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-anion-and-osmolal-gaps-in-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. NH<sub>4</sub> is often excreted with chloride but may also be excreted with other anions such as ketoacid anions, sulfate, hippurate, or bicarbonate (although the excretion of NH<sub>4</sub> with bicarbonate does not remove nonvolatile acid from the body, since bicarbonate loss is equivalent to hydrogen ion generation).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H634207391\"><span class=\"h1\">USE OF URINE ANION AND OSMOLAL GAPS IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF DISTAL RTA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual renal response to metabolic acidosis with acidemia is to reduce the urine pH to 5.3 or less. Distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is characterized by a urine pH that is persistently above 5.5 despite metabolic acidosis and acidemia. However, other conditions, such as severe or chronic diarrhea, can present with similar findings despite a normal kidney response to acidosis. These disorders are distinguished by high urine ammonium levels with diarrhea and low urine ammonium levels in patients with RTA. UAG or UOG, which are potential analogs of the urine ammonium concentration, may be useful in distinguishing distal RTA from certain nonRTA causes of metabolic acidosis. Because of diagnostic difficulties associated with the UAG described below, we prefer to use the UOG. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of the UAG'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with metabolic acidosis due to persistent severe diarrhea may have a urine pH above 5.5 despite normal kidneys and an appropriate renal response to the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-anion-and-osmolal-gaps-in-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This occurs because both metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia combine to generate a potent stimulus to renal ammoniagenesis and the secretion of ammonia into the urine. Hypokalemia does this, at least in part, by promoting the exit of potassium from cells in exchange for hydrogen entry into cells. The resulting intracellular acidification stimulates ammoniagenesis and renal tubular ammonium secretion. Hypokalemia also has other effects on renal ammoniagenesis and ammonia transport that simultaneously enhance ammonium excretion and potassium conservation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-anion-and-osmolal-gaps-in-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]; expression of major ammonia transporters are increased, such as Rhesus glycoproteins in alpha-intercalated cells and principal cells of the collecting duct. Ammonia that is secreted into the tubular lumen usually binds to hydrogen ions to form NH<sub>4</sub>:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;NH3 + H &#160;&harr; &#160;NH4</p></div></div><p>Binding H to NH<sub>3</sub> reduces the urine hydrogen ion concentration, and this can raise the urine pH above 5.5. When this occurs, the relatively high urine pH in a patient with hyperchloremic, hypokalemic metabolic acidosis may incorrectly suggest that the patient has RTA. However, the high urine pH in patients with distal RTA reflects a defect in renal hydrogen ion secretion and is typically associated with a reduced urine NH<sub>4</sub> excretion rate. By contrast, diarrhea-associated metabolic acidosis may generate a relatively high urine pH because of a potent renal ammoniagenesis and ammonium excretory response.</p><p>Direct measurement of urine NH<sub>4</sub> should readily differentiate these conditions. Unfortunately, many if not most hospital clinical laboratories do not offer this measurement. Thus, two alternative urine electrolyte <span class=\"nowrap\">measurements/calculations</span> have been proposed as indirect, semiquantitative analogs of urine NH<sub>4</sub>. They are the UAG and the UOG. These indirect indicators of urine NH<sub>4</sub> can help differentiate certain nonRTA-induced hyperchloremic metabolic acidoses, such as that generated by chronic diarrhea, from RTA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-anion-and-osmolal-gaps-in-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">URINE ANION GAP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The UAG, sometimes also called the &quot;urine cation gap&quot; or the &quot;urine net charge&quot;, is calculated as the difference between the sum of the urine sodium (Na) plus potassium (K) concentrations and the urine chloride (Cl) concentration (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-urine-anion-gap\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>).</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;UAG (in <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> &#160;= &#160;Urine (Na + K - Cl)</p></div></div><p>It is important to understand that the formula for the UAG is different from the formula used to calculate the serum anion gap. The serum anion gap is the difference between the serum sodium and the sum of the serum chloride and bicarbonate concentrations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-metabolic-acidosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with metabolic acidosis&quot;, section on 'Physiologic interpretation of the serum anion gap'</a>.)</p><p>When individuals ingest a typical Western diet, the quantity of sodium and potassium absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract usually exceeds the quantity of absorbed chloride. Thus, under normal circumstances, net balance considerations mandate that the sum of sodium and potassium excreted into the urine is greater than the amount of excreted urine chloride. The UAG therefore has a <strong>positive</strong> value (between 20 and 90) in healthy individuals ingesting such diets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-anion-and-osmolal-gaps-in-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/4,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,13</a>].</p><p>If large volume <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic, watery diarrhea develops, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis can develop due to the loss of sodium and potassium with bicarbonate and with potential bicarbonate anions (such as butyrate, citrate, and lactate) in the stool. Loss of these ions causes renal sodium and potassium excretion to fall without a parallel fall in chloride excretion. The cation excreted with the chloride under these conditions is NH<sub>4</sub>. As a result, the urine Cl concentration usually exceeds the sum of urine sodium plus potassium concentrations, and the UAG becomes <strong>negative</strong> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-anion-and-osmolal-gaps-in-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/1,2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4,5</a>]. By contrast, patients with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis generated by renal tubular acidosis (RTA) have reduced urinary ammonium excretion. Also, they are not losing sodium and potassium in the stool. Thus, their urine sodium, potassium, and chloride excretion reflects their dietary intake, and these patients generally have a <strong>positive</strong> UAG. The UAG can therefore provide an indirect, or surrogate, estimate of urinary NH<sub>4</sub> excretion.</p><p>Although the UAG is a gross indicator of the urine NH<sub>4</sub> concentration, the relationship is too loose to be considered a quantitative or exact measurement of urine NH<sub>4</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-anion-and-osmolal-gaps-in-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/1,3-5,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-5,13,14</a>].

Some examples of these unmeasured urine anions include beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate in patients with ketoacidosis, hippurate following toluene inhalation (glue sniffing), bicarbonate when patients with proximal RTA are treated with alkali therapy, D-lactate in D-lactic acidosis, and 5-oxoproline associated with chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> ingestion (especially in malnourished women). These anions may be excreted with sodium or potassium or with NH<sub>4</sub>. The excretion of NH<sub>4</sub> with such unmeasured anions will not reduce the UAG as occurs when NH<sub>4</sub> is excreted with chloride. In addition, the excretion of sodium <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> potassium with such unmeasured anions contributes to a positive UAG. Thus, the excretion of such anions will disrupt the relationship between the UAG and urine NH<sub>4</sub>.

Toluene is metabolized to benzoic acid and then to hippuric acid. Accumulation of these relatively strong acids in the body fluids generates metabolic acidosis. To the extent that the benzoate and hippurate anions are retained in the extracellular fluid, the metabolic acidosis is of the high-anion-gap type (caused by a reciprocal reduction in HCO<sub>3</sub> and increase in benzoate and hippurate). However, in patients with normal or near-normal renal function, the hippurate and benzoate anions are rapidly excreted in the urine by both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. These anions are initially excreted together with sodium and potassium (in this phase, the UAG will become more positive). With time, urine NH<sub>4</sub> excretion progressively increases in response to both acidemia and hypokalemia. The NH<sub>4</sub> is largely excreted with hippurate. Under these conditions, the UAG will likely remain positive and erroneously suggests a relatively low NH<sub>4</sub> excretion (since the UAG only detects NH<sub>4</sub> excreted with chloride).</p><p>Marked hypokalemia often develops in these patients because the early loss of sodium hippurate generates volume contraction and secondary hyperaldosteronism. High aldosterone levels, together with high distal tubule sodium delivery (as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-benzoate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium benzoate</a> and sodium hippurate), causes substantial renal potassium wasting. Hypokalemia further increases renal ammoniagenesis and ammonium excretion. As a result, more hydrogen ions become bound to NH<sub>3</sub> to form NH<sub>4</sub>, and the urine pH will often rise above 5.5. The combination of a hyperchloremic, hypokalemic metabolic acidosis, a high urine pH, and a positive UAG mimics the findings expected with distal RTA.</p><p>These diagnostic difficulties associated with the UAG led to the introduction of another surrogate indicator of urine NH<sub>4</sub>: the UOG.

Since, under most conditions, ammonium salts are the only other major urinary solutes that contribute importantly to the urine osmolality, this result should be proportional to urinary ammonium. The ammonium salts include NH<sub>4</sub>Cl as well as NH<sub>4</sub> excreted with any &quot;unmeasured&quot; anions such as beta-hydroxybutyrate or hippurate. Thus, the UOG will increase when the urinary excretion of any NH<sub>4</sub> salt increases.

Distal RTA is characterized by a urine pH that is persistently above 5.5 despite metabolic acidosis and acidemia. The normal renal response to metabolic acidosis with acidemia is to increase acid secretion and reduce the urine pH to 5.3 or less. However, some patients with normal renal acidification mechanisms who develop metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia may have a urine pH above 5.5. This is due to high levels of urine ammonium. If patients with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and acidemia have a urine pH above 5.5, measurement of urine ammonium can differentiate those with distal RTA from those with normal renal acidification mechanisms. However, if urine ammonium cannot be readily measured, then the urine anion gap (UAG) or urine osmolal gap (UOG) may be useful in distinguishing RTA from nonRTA causes of metabolic acidosis (such as diarrhea).

The excretion of NH<sub>4</sub> with such unmeasured anions will not reduce the UAG as occurs when NH<sub>4</sub> is excreted with chloride. When these conditions exist, the UAG may become a misleading indicator of urine ammonium excretion and no longer correctly indicate the etiology of the metabolic acidosis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of the UAG'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An alternative method to qualitatively estimate the urine NH<sub>4</sub> concentration is the UOG. This calculation correlates well with urine NH<sub>4</sub> whether it is excreted with chloride or any other anion. Thus, the relationship between the UOG and NH<sub>4</sub> excretion is generally <strong>not</strong> disrupted by those conditions that will disrupt the relationship between urine NH<sub>4</sub> and the UAG. The UOG is calculated as the mathematical difference between the directly measured urine osmolality and the calculated urine osmolality derived from the urine concentrations of sodium, potassium, urea nitrogen (or urea), and, if the dipstick is glucose positive, glucose concentrations (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-urine-osmolal-gap-uog\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-urine-osmolal-gap-uog-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 3</a>) (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Urine osmolal gap'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3570211824\" class=\"local\">'Usual clinical application of the UOG'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A UOG of less than 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> in a patient with chronic metabolic acidosis suggests that NH<sub>4</sub> excretion is impaired.

The urine ammonium concentration will no longer reflect renal ammonium excretion. Both direct measurement of urine ammonium and the UOG will then fail as indicators of renal NH<sub>4</sub> excretion. The UOG will also become misleading as an index of urine ammonium if osmotically active, nonammonium solutes are excreted that are not included in the calculated urine osmolality (eg, alcohols [ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol] and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>).
