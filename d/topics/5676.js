Teenagers as a group are at highest risk for crashes related to drowsy driving; other high-risk groups include patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and other sleep disorders, shift workers, medical house staff, law enforcement officers, and commercial drivers.</p><p>Individuals at high risk for drowsy driving crashes should be identified and educated about how to recognize symptoms of drowsy driving and about countermeasures they can institute to reduce crash risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Education has been endorsed by a National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) expert panel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and by the American Thoracic Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Additionally, sleep disorders and other medical conditions that may contribute to sleepiness while driving are important to recognize and treat.</p><p>This topic will review important aspects of the evaluation and management of drowsy driving. An approach to the evaluation of excessive daytime sleepiness more generally is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-excessive-daytime-sleepiness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H877976865\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drowsy driving is a very common problem. In polls conducted by the National Sleep Foundation and others, about 60 percent of drivers admit to driving while feeling sleepy, about 40 percent have nodded off or fallen asleep while driving during the prior year, and about one-quarter report drowsy driving at least once per month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Among teenagers, 50 to 70 percent admit to drowsy driving in the past year, and 15 percent report doing so at least once per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Self-reported sleepiness while driving is associated with a 2.5-fold increase in the relative risk of motor vehicle crash [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Crash data from police reports and federal databases in the United States indicate that an average of 83,000 crashes occur annually because of drowsy driving, causing 1000 deaths and 71,000 injuries annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Crashes due to drowsy driving are a particular concern in teenagers and young adults. (See <a href=\"#H2378728395\" class=\"local\">'Teenage and young adult drivers'</a> below.)</p><p>Drowsy driving accounts for an estimated one in six fatal crashes and one in eight crashes leading to hospitalization of the driver or passengers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These high proportions are consistent with the observation that drowsy driving crashes occur at high speed, with an absence of avoidance maneuvers such as braking or swerving that could mitigate crash severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Off-road deviation, rear-ending another vehicle, and late-night or early-afternoon timing of a crash also increase the likelihood that a crash was related to drowsy driving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The number of crashes due to drowsy driving may be underestimated, as drivers may be unaware of their sleepiness or reluctant to volunteer it to police. In addition, many law enforcement officers are insufficiently trained to recognize drowsy driving crashes, and during the immediate aftermath of a crash, the driver may appear to be alert because of the sympathetic hyperactivity that accompanies the event. Sleepiness may be overlooked when alcohol is also involved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19898068\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS OF DROWSINESS ON DRIVING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drowsiness impairs a host of cognitive functions that are important for driving, including judgment, attention, executive function, cognitive processing speed, memory, reaction time, and muscular coordination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These cognitive effects may be compounded by &quot;microsleeps&quot; &ndash; brief, involuntary episodes of sleep, which can last from a fraction of a second up to 30 seconds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insufficient-sleep-definition-epidemiology-and-adverse-outcomes#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insufficient sleep: Definition, epidemiology, and adverse outcomes&quot;, section on 'Effects of acute sleep deprivation'</a>.)</p><p>During a microsleep, an individual experiences a temporary lapse in consciousness and is unable to respond to sensory stimuli. Electroencephalography (EEG) shows sleep in the theta range (4 to 7 Hz) superimposed on a background of wakefulness (alpha) rhythm (8 to 12 Hz). Despite EEG evidence of sleep, most individuals are unaware of a microsleep and believe they were awake. Behavioral manifestations of microsleeps include head nodding, slow eyelid closure, and eyelid drooping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Drowsy driving has been compared with drunk driving in terms of its impact on performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>]. After 24 consecutive hours of being awake, the level of impairment on the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (a test of sustained attention and vigilance, which measures the speed with which individuals respond to visual stimuli) resembles that seen in drivers with a blood alcohol of 0.08 percent, which is considered legally drunk across the United States. In driving simulator studies, sleep-deprived subjects have more lane (steering) deviations and more simulated crashes than well-rested subjects. Similar effects are well documented in patients with chronic sleep disruption due to untreated sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). (See <a href=\"#H3142054689\" class=\"local\">'Sleep apnea and other sleep disorders'</a> below.)</p><p>Circadian factors also influence driving performance. Accidents in which drowsiness, rather than alcohol, is deemed to be a factor tend to coincide with times of highest sleep propensity: early morning (midnight to 7 AM) and mid-afternoon (3 PM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This pattern is most obvious among the youngest drivers.</p><p>Inter-individual differences may also play a role in driving performance, as healthy adults show marked differences in neurobehavioral performance after sleep deprivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insufficient-sleep-definition-epidemiology-and-adverse-outcomes#H433566550\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insufficient sleep: Definition, epidemiology, and adverse outcomes&quot;, section on 'Interindividual variation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3585313850\"><span class=\"h1\">HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although drowsy driving is a common problem that may arise situationally in any driver who is sleep deprived, certain groups are recognized to be at higher risk than others for habitual drowsy driving and its consequences, including teenage drivers, patients with sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and narcolepsy, and commercial drivers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F106459\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106459 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2378728395\"><span class=\"h2\">Teenage and young adult drivers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Young drivers are at particularly high risk for drowsy driving-related crashes. In a study that examined over 4000 drowsy driving crashes, drivers aged 16 to 24, mostly males, accounted for over half of the crashes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Multiple factors may contribute to the risk of drowsy driving accidents among teens, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A state of chronic sleep deprivation resulting from the combination of delayed sleep phase, with teens having a greater preference for later bedtimes and wake times, and early school start times. Over half of teenagers report getting less than the recommended number of hours of sleep per night (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F106597\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106597 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/5,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,28-30</a>].

On average, young adults respond faster than older adults. After sleep deprivation, however, younger drivers have much slower reaction times compared with older drivers, whose reaction times remain relatively resistant to sleep deprivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Sleep deprivation can also impair executive function, leading to impulsivity, aggression, and risky decision-making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3142054689\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep apnea and other sleep disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OSA increases the risk of crashes by two- to threefold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 16 observational studies, most of which were retrospective, the relative risk of crash in patients with OSA compared with controls was 2.4 (95% CI 1.2-4.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The most consistently identified factors associated with increased risk were body mass index, apnea-hypopnea index, and severity of hypoxemia. The presence of daytime sleepiness predicted risk of crash in some studies but not others, indicating that the absence of subjective sleepiness does not eliminate risk. Additional risk factors include advanced age and concomitant use of alcohol or sedatives.</p><p>Laboratory-based studies have shown impaired psychomotor vigilance and driving simulator performance in patients with untreated OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/22,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,36</a>]. In one study, performance of patients with mild to moderate untreated OSA was worse than those with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.06 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These effects can be seen in patients with and without daytime sleepiness and are magnified by concurrent use of alcohol or sedatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>Patients with other sleep disorders may also be at increased risk for drowsy driving crashes, although data are more limited.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Narcolepsy &ndash; One case-control study evaluated 70 control drivers and 424 drivers who had untreated sleep disorders including sleep apnea, narcolepsy, another sleep disorder with excessive sleepiness, or a sleep disorder without excessive sleepiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Patients with narcolepsy were most likely to be involved in a sleep-related crash. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults#H364808752\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of narcolepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Driving safety'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic insomnia &ndash; Insomnia may contribute to an increased risk of crashes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. In a population-based study of 54,399 adults in Norway followed for a median of 14 years, self-reported insomnia was associated with a two- to threefold increase in the risk of fatal crashes, independent of age, alcohol use, and medication use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The use of hypnotics for insomnia is another factor that may contribute to impaired driving in some individuals; particularly high-risk groups include women and older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults#H1965505\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of insomnia in adults&quot;, section on 'Dosing precautions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3731862220\"><span class=\"h2\">Sedating medications and alcohol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many classes of medications can cause drowsiness, including benzodiazepines, opioids, sedative hypnotics, barbiturates, antiemetics, anticonvulsants, antihistamines, anticholinergics, antidepressants, muscle relaxants, antipsychotics, anti-Parkinson medications, and hypoglycemic agents. These drugs pose risks for drowsy driving when used alone and especially in combination with other drugs, alcohol, or sleep deprivation. </p><p>Groups at particular risk are those receiving a new or increased dose of a sedating medication; those who are using multiple sedating medications concomitantly; those who are using sedating medications at high doses; and older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>One study in older adults found that the traffic accident risk increased by nearly 50 percent in the first week after starting benzodiazepine therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. A population study of older drivers involved in traffic accidents resulting in hospitalization found that the use of benzodiazepines was associated with a fivefold increased risk for having a serious accident; increased risk was also associated with use of antidepressants (odds ratio [OR] 1.8) or opioids (OR 1.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the evaluation of older drivers&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The combination of alcohol or sedatives and sleep deprivation compounds drowsiness. In a laboratory-based study in which participants were restricted to four hours of sleep, consuming one unit of beer had the same impact that six beers would have in fully rested individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1512410313\"><span class=\"h2\">Commercial drivers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Commercial drivers have been identified as a high-risk group for drowsy driving and its consequences. Contributing factors include sleep deprivation, overnight driving (at a time of peak sleep propensity), and high rates of comorbid OSA.</p><p>The National Transportation Safety Board in the United States estimates that drowsy driving is responsible for more than half of all crashes in which the operator of the truck is killed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Large truck crashes account for nearly 4000 deaths and 100,000 injuries per year in the United States, and approximately three-quarters of those injured or killed are occupants of other vehicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>Sleep deprivation and self-reported drowsy driving is common in commercial drivers. In a poll of transportation workers, 20 percent admitted to driving a private vehicle while drowsy in the prior month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Another study found that 14 percent of long-haul commercial truck drivers sleep for an average of less than five hours per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Train operators as a group had the highest rates of self-reported drowsy driving, with 39 percent admitting to driving while drowsy at least once in the prior month.</p><p>OSA is a common cause of daytime sleepiness and a known risk factor for drowsy driving and crashes. The reported prevalence of sleep apnea in commercial truck drivers is very high, ranging from 28 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. This high prevalence is probably because commercial truck drivers are disproportionately male, middle aged, and obese. (See <a href=\"#H3142054689\" class=\"local\">'Sleep apnea and other sleep disorders'</a> above.)</p><p>Commercial drivers may require a higher standard for assessing medical fitness to drive compared with passenger car drivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], based on the fact that crashes involving commercial vehicles are more likely to result in the death of others on the road and carry a high cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/46,52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,52-54</a>].

In a prospective cohort study of 2737 interns who completed web-based surveys, interns who drove after an extended work shift (&ge;24 hours) were more likely to be involved in a fall-asleep crash (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.6-3.3) or a near-miss incident (OR 5.9, 95% CI 5.4-6.3) than interns who drove after a normal work shift [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. For each extra monthly extended shift worked, the odds of a fall-asleep crash increased by 9 percent. These findings have been corroborated in driving simulator studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>] and have contributed to duty hour regulations that limit the number of extended shifts and weekly hours worked for interns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Law enforcement officers &ndash; One study assessed nearly 5000 state and local law enforcement officers in the United States and Canada for sleep disorders and sleepiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. A total of 40 percent screened positive for a sleep disorder; 46 percent admitted to having fallen asleep while driving, and 26 percent stated that this happened one to two times during the past month.

Patients should also be advised that self-assessment of drowsiness is unreliable, and that in the setting of inadequate sleep, they may be at risk even if they do not feel drowsy. Technological countermeasures may also play an increasingly important role in real-time recognition and prevention of drowsy driving, particularly since self-rating of performance can be inaccurate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2722615687\"><span class=\"h2\">Driver education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drivers should be educated about the symptoms and signs of drowsy driving and about effective countermeasures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Symptoms of drowsy driving include difficulty focusing, frequent blinking, heavy eyelids, daydreaming, <span class=\"nowrap\">wandering/disconnected</span> thoughts, difficulty remembering the last few miles driven (sometimes called &quot;automatic behavior&quot;) or missing exits and street signs, frequent yawning, rubbing eyes, difficulty keeping head up, drifting from lane to lane, tailgating or hitting a shoulder, and feeling restless and irritable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>].</p><p>Individuals should also be aware that the ability to self-rate sleepiness and performance is unreliable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Although performance continues to decline with cumulative days of sleep deprivation, subjective ratings of sleepiness tend to level off after the first few days in laboratory conditions of sleep deprivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>], and drivers are often unaware of their own level of sleepiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>Rather than driving while drowsy, drivers should be told to use other modes of transportation, such as ride sharing, public transportation, taxis, or walking. Importantly, drivers should be advised to plan ahead so that they avoid driving during times of day when they are likely to be sleepy, such as mid-afternoon, late at night, or after a period of sleep deprivation; to keep their trips short (under 20 minutes); and to use alternative modes of transportation.</p><p>All patients who have a sleep disorder that may contribute to sleepiness should be warned about the risk of driving while drowsy. Those patients who are considered high-risk (eg, those with excessive daytime sleepiness and a history of a drowsy driving crash or near miss) should be warned not to drive until therapy has been instituted and proven effective. A written information sheet is ideal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F75875\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75875 \">table 5</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H834956812\"><span class=\"h2\">Counseling about sedating medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drivers who use sedating medications should be warned about the risk of drowsy driving crashes and advised not to consume alcohol in combination with such drugs. Individuals should be vigilant for symptoms that could indicate driving impairment, particularly during the titration period, including sleepiness, inattention, tremor, incoordination, confusion, gait instability, vision changes, fainting, or dizziness.</p><p>Individuals should also be advised to allow sufficient sleep opportunity following the use of sedating medications. Prescribing information for sedative hypnotic drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolpidem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zolpidem</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eszopiclone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eszopiclone</a> contains specific warnings about the risk of next-day &quot;sleep driving.&quot; This may be due to amnesia, microsleeps while driving, or a parasomnia characterized by a lack of awareness that they are operating a vehicle while under the influence of the drug. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults#H1965505\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of insomnia in adults&quot;, section on 'Dosing precautions'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to warning patients about the risk of drowsy driving, clinicians should also consider alternative nonsedating therapies, use the lowest dose required to achieve therapeutic effect, and modify dosing schedules when possible to limit drowsiness when the patient needs to drive. A clinician who considers prescribing a sedating medication should first conduct a careful analysis of potential risks, including drowsy driving, against the possible benefits of taking these drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4171656110\"><span class=\"h2\">Naps and caffeine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best countermeasure for combating drowsy driving is to obtain adequate sleep, as sleep debt can only be repaid with sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/10,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,83</a>]. Adequacy of sleep requires both sufficient sleep duration for age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F106597\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106597 \">figure 1</a>) and restorative sleep quality. Therefore, any underlying sleep disorders should be treated effectively.</p><p>If patients experience drowsiness when driving, they should be encouraged to pull off the road to a safe area as soon as possible and sleep. Even a brief 20-minute nap can improve neurobehavioral performance after sleep deprivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Longer naps may lead to sleep inertia, which can reduce performance during the first 30 minutes after waking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p>Judicious use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">caffeine</a> can also help. Although caffeine use has not been studied formally in real-world driving conditions, laboratory-based studies of sustained sleep deprivation have found that reaction times, vigilance, and sustained attention improve after caffeine intake, particularly when combined with napping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Small quantities of caffeine taken over a longer period may be more effective than a single larger dose. </p><p>Other strategies commonly used to counter sleepiness, such as exposure to cold air, eating, drinking, and turning on the radio have not been shown to be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/10,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,83</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1794088324\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of sleep apnea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of OSA is an important part of prevention in both commercial and noncommercial drivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/34,65,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,65,86</a>].

Individuals were given a single dose of 300 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a> or placebo and then underwent driving simulator testing two hours later. Compared with placebo-treated subjects, those treated with modafinil had fewer lane deviations on driving simulator testing, but other measures did not improve, including off-road deviations, reaction time to a concurrent task, and speed deviations. Despite this, subjects rated their own performance as improved. More studies are therefore needed before modafinil can be recommended for drowsy driving under conditions of sleep deprivation.</p><p>In patients with OSA, the use of stimulants is not routinely advised to reduce driving risk, given a paucity of evidence that benefits on driving performance would offset potential risks, including costs, side effects, less compliance with effective therapy such as positive airway pressure, and false reassurance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>In contrast, patients with severe hypersomnolence due to a primary sleep disorder such as narcolepsy are routinely treated with stimulants or wake-promoting agents to improve daytime alertness.

Some states mandate reporting of unsafe drivers, while others permit (without necessarily mandating) violation of doctor-patient confidentiality, if a physician believes it is in the best interest of the patient or the public safety. When determining whether to report, clinicians may have to weigh conflicting guidelines: a professional obligation to report and a legal requirement to maintain confidentiality, even in the face of danger to the public [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. An expert panel of the American Thoracic Society advocates reporting &quot;if a highest-risk patient (eg, severe daytime sleepiness and a previous motor vehicle crash or near miss) insists on driving before the condition has been successfully treated or fails to comply with treatment requirements&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Commercial drivers are generally held to a higher standard of medical fitness than noncommercial drivers, and in many cases, this includes considerations about known or suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or other sleep disorders such as shift work sleep disorder and chronic insufficient sleep, which may increase risk of drowsy driving. Sleepiness in long-haul commercial vehicle drivers carries great risk, as these operators spend many hours driving continuously in monotonous, sedentary conditions, in heavy vehicles, and sometimes late at night; yet, being unable to drive can be financially ruinous. Regulations and requirements for licensure may vary by state and country, and clinicians involved in the care of these individuals may find useful guidance in a task force report from the American College of Chest Physicians and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>] as well as the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration <a href=\"https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/medical&amp;token=oN6rXOmeBLkIpfIsq5mH5XJl0CCj+AEfNPSM1T+Swx75kfI9+fseYEHIUFFU0NtXMIU6ASnrNtYPVqlWTApklA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=101086\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a>.

Approximately 40 percent of drivers admit to having nodded off or fallen asleep while driving in the past year, and about 25 percent admit to habitual drowsy driving (eg, at least once per month). (See <a href=\"#H877976865\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self-reported sleepiness while driving is associated with a 2.5-fold increase in the relative risk of motor vehicle crashes. Drowsiness impairs a host of cognitive functions that are important for driving, including judgment, attention, executive function, cognitive processing speed, memory, reaction time, and muscular coordination. (See <a href=\"#H19898068\" class=\"local\">'Effects of drowsiness on driving'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although drowsy driving is a common problem that may occur in any driver who is sleep deprived, certain groups are recognized to be at higher risk than others for habitual drowsy driving and its consequences, including teenage drivers, patients with sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and narcolepsy, night shift workers, and commercial drivers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F106459\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106459 \">table 1</a>). Use of sedating medications and alcohol, particularly in combination with sleep deprivation, also poses risks. (See <a href=\"#H3585313850\" class=\"local\">'High-risk populations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with self-reported drowsy driving, including those with a history of a fall-asleep crash or near miss, should be evaluated to identify treatable causes of drowsiness and high-risk lifestyle behaviors or habits that can be targeted for counseling and prevention. The history should focus on risk factors as well as symptoms and signs suggestive of OSA or other sleep disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F106460\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106460 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2062755720\" class=\"local\">'Clinical history and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing is indicated in patients with suspected OSA, which is often undiagnosed and represents an important and treatable risk factor for drowsy driving and its consequences. Laboratory-based assessments of sleepiness, such as driving simulators, psychomotor vigilance testing, multiple sleep latency testing, and maintenance of wakefulness testing are not routinely indicated, as they have not been validated as predictive tools for on-the-road performance, and normal results do not guarantee adequate alertness and safety. (See <a href=\"#H1920291674\" class=\"local\">'Polysomnography and other testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Key aspects of prevention and risk modification include education about symptoms of drowsy driving, avoiding driving when drowsy, use of naps and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">caffeine</a> when driving cannot be avoided, and treatment of any underlying causes of excessive sleepiness, such as OSA. Technological countermeasures may also play an increasingly important role in real-time recognition and prevention of drowsy driving. (See <a href=\"#H877976949\" class=\"local\">'Prevention and countermeasures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with a sleep disorder that can cause sleepiness should be warned about the risk of driving while drowsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F75875\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75875 \">table 5</a>). Although specific laws vary by state and country, in general, clinicians who fail to inform a patient of his or her risk of injury due to a medical condition or its treatment may be held liable to the patient if an injury occurs subsequently.
