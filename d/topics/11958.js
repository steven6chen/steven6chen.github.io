In adults, the most common problems are deficiencies of micronutrients (nutrients needed for life in small quantities) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72725\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72725 \">table 1</a>), including several water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins, and minerals including calcium, iron, and other trace minerals. </p><p>Clinically important deficiencies in macronutrients (providing total energy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> protein) are less common in adults. However, these are very important issues in children with IBD, as discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth failure and poor weight gain in children with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Micronutrient deficiencies in adults and children with inflammatory bowel disease will be reviewed here. Weight loss and other manifestations of macronutrient deficiency in adults will be mentioned briefly. Diet and Inflammatory Bowel Disease are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition and dietary interventions in adults with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A combination of factors contributes to deficits in energy and protein in IBD. Reduced nutrient intake is common; it is associated with disease activity and may be mediated by proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha. Malabsorption, maldigestion, increased energy expenditure, and gastrointestinal protein loss also contribute to deficiencies of energy and protein, and are usually correlated with disease activity. These mechanisms are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth failure and poor weight gain in children with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis of growth failure'</a>.)</p><p>Similar mechanisms also contribute to micronutrient deficiencies in IBD. In addition, because some nutrients are digested and absorbed within specific locations within the gastrointestinal tract, the activity and location of a patient's intestinal disease determines risk for specific micronutrient deficiencies. As examples, patients with disease of the terminal ileum are at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency, and those with disease of the proximal small intestine are more likely to malabsorb calcium and iron.</p><p>Individuals who have undergone small bowel resection are also at risk for micronutrient deficiencies, the nature of which depends on the extent and location of the resected bowel. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of the short bowel syndrome in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of short bowel syndrome in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">WATER-SOLUBLE VITAMINS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Folic acid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Folate deficiency was observed in 20 to 60 percent of adults with IBD in older series, and is uncommon in studies from the last decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This historical difference may reflect changes in medical therapy (eg, less use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a>) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> higher levels of folate intake through supplements or foods. In modern series of children with newly diagnosed IBD, folate concentrations were normal or higher than those of controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The clinical implications of this finding have yet to be determined.</p><p>The diet of patients with inflammatory bowel disease often contains insufficient amounts of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In addition, treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> may exacerbate folate deficiency, since the drug's sulfa moiety can bind folate in the gut lumen, leaving it unavailable for absorption. This is not true for other aminosalicylates, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesalamine-mesalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mesalamine</a>. Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (a folic acid antagonist) can also contribute to folate deficiency. Folate deficiency may contribute to the development of anemia in patients with IBD.</p><p>Retrospective studies have raised the possibility that folate supplementation induces a protective effect against dysplasia and colorectal cancer in patients with ulcerative colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Another study suggested that this is the case only for the subgroup of patients with high serum levels of homocysteine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The possible effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplementation on colorectal cancer risk have been better studied in patients without IBD, as discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-supplementation-in-disease-prevention#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin supplementation in disease prevention&quot;, section on 'Folic acid'</a>.)</p><p>Supplementation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> is generally recommended in IBD patients who are treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, and in others if low serum folate levels are found on laboratory screening. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of supplemental folic acid for other patients with IBD.

Factors contributing to vitamin B12 deficiency include disease or resection of the terminal ileum, gastritis, and bacterial overgrowth. Vitamin B12 deficiency can contribute to the increased incidence of anemia seen in patients with IBD.</p><p>Serum vitamin B12 levels should be monitored periodically in all patients with ileal CD and in those who have undergone an ileal resection. The diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring serum homocysteine levels and methylmalonic acid. The diagnosis and treatment of this issue is discussed in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults#H12689078\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Malabsorption'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Niacin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low plasma concentrations of niacin are common among patients with CD, but clinically apparent disease is rare. In one study of adults with CD in remission, low plasma concentrations of niacin were found in 77 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Pellagra (the clinical manifestations of niacin deficiency) has been described in adult patients with CD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-water-soluble-vitamins#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of water-soluble vitamins&quot;, section on 'Vitamin B3 (niacin)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">FAT-SOLUBLE VITAMINS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (vitamins A, D, E, and K) can occur in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) if it is complicated by fat malabsorption. Fat malabsorption may be caused by bile acid deficiency due to terminal ileal disease or resection (because bile acids undergo active resorption in the terminal ileum), or by the use of medicines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholestyramine-resin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cholestyramine</a>, that bind bile acids. Currently, the recommended intake of fat-soluble vitamins for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is no different from the recommended intake for healthy individuals. However, patients with active IBD appear to be at increased risk for these deficiencies, so focused counseling and monitoring is warranted, as detailed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Vitamin A</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vitamin A</a> (retinol) deficiency has been described in IBD. In one study of adult patients with CD, 5 percent had clinically significant vitamin A deficiency characterized by impaired dark adaptation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Low serum levels of vitamin A do not always indicate clinical deficiency because this finding can be caused by hypoproteinemia. Vitamin A is considered an antioxidant, but there is no clear evidence that deficiency of this or other antioxidants are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation in IBD. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Antioxidant vitamins'</a> below.)</p><p>Excessive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> supplementation should be avoided because high intakes of vitamin A are associated with an increased risk of bone fractures, as well as other effects including pseudotumor cerebri. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-a#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin A&quot;, section on 'Adverse effects on bone'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Vitamin D</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vitamin D insufficiency is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In one study, 25 percent of adults with CD had deficient serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD, calcidiol) concentrations (&lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Studies in children report that 6 to 36 percent of children with IBD have deficient 25OHD concentrations (&lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Several factors probably contribute to the variability in reported vitamin D concentrations, including genetic and environmental factors (diet and sun exposure), as well as factors related to the IBD itself (malabsorption and anorexia). In addition, a study in children suggests that IBD is associated with abnormal vitamin D metabolism, reflected by the absence of a secondary elevation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations in the subset of children with 25OHD &lt;30, and impaired conversion of 25OHD to 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These effects may be mediated by inflammatory cytokines, which suppress PTH and renal 1-&alpha; hydroxylase activity. One study suggests that only about 10 percent of patients with IBD malabsorb vitamin D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Vitamin D deficiency is one of several mechanisms for bone disease in inflammatory bowel disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metabolic bone disease in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The recommended intake of vitamin D for children and adults with IBD is the same as for healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>], (ie, 600 IU daily according to a 2010 report by the Institute of Medicine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Because patients with IBD have an increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency and metabolic bone disease, we suggest that intake recommendations be reinforced by focused dietary counseling, and that vitamin D intake be augmented by supplements if necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-d#H1172139\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin D&quot;, section on 'Requirements'</a>.)</p><p>Individuals with malabsorption or established vitamin D deficiency may require higher doses of vitamin D to reach target levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. In such patients, the adequacy of the calcium and vitamin D supplementation should be confirmed by measurements of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D; some providers also measure PTH because elevated PTH provides additional evidence of clinically significant vitamin D deficiency or calcium malabsorption. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D deficiency in adults: Definition, clinical manifestations, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because of its effects as a regulator of the immune system, vitamin D has been investigated as a possible adjunctive therapy in IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. There is insufficient evidence to determine if vitamin D supplementation is effective in this role.

However, this association is based on indirect evidence, and whether supplementation with vitamin K in patients with IBD can help prevent or treat bone disease has not been established.

Indeed, a few studies have documented lower plasma concentrations of antioxidant vitamins (ascorbic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> [alpha- and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a>], lycopene, and beta-cryptoxanthin) in patients with CD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/25,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,29</a>]. Supplementation with high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a> (800 International Units) and C (1000 mg) significantly reduced laboratory measures of oxidative stress in a similar group of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A few other randomized trials using smaller doses of antioxidants in various combinations generally reduced measures of oxidative stress but did not show effects on disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

Thus, there is no direct evidence suggesting that supplementation with antioxidant vitamins can reduce inflammation in patients with IBD. Moreover, high dose supplementation of vitamins A or E may have adverse effects on bone or cardiovascular health, respectively, and is not recommended.

In the presence of inflammation (as suggested by an elevated CRP), serum ferritin levels below 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> should be considered abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/35,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,38</a>].

In such cases, addition of erythropoietin to the treatment program may result in improvement of the anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/46,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,52</a>].

However, serum zinc levels vary with albumin and correlate poorly with total body zinc stores; clinically significant zinc deficiency is probably much less common. A deficient state is often reflected by a decreased serum alkaline phosphatase concentration since alkaline phosphatase is a zinc metalloenzyme. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals#H58\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of dietary trace minerals&quot;, section on 'Zinc'</a>.)</p><p>Excessive losses of zinc may be observed in patients with ostomies, fistulas, and profuse diarrhea, or in those with prolonged parenteral nutrition unless trace minerals are included. Several clinical manifestations of zinc deficiency have been described (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F55126\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55126 \">table 2</a>). The skin changes are the most distinctive manifestations. These usually consist of dry scaly eczematous plaques, often on the face and anogenital area; the lesions often resemble psoriasis. Many other manifestations, such as growth failure, are nonspecific and are more likely to be caused by mechanisms other than zinc deficiency in patients with IBD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth failure and poor weight gain in children with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptomatic zinc deficiency in patients with IBD is treated with oral or parenteral zinc at replacement doses. A low serum alkaline phosphatase concentration is also suggestive of zinc deficiency, since alkaline phosphatase is a zinc-dependent enzyme. In our practice, we also provide zinc supplements to asymptomatic patients with low serum zinc concentrations, using maintenance doses of 10 to 15 mg of elemental zinc daily, because the symptoms of zinc deficiency may be subtle, and zinc supplementation at these doses is generally safe. Appropriate dosing of zinc supplements is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-sulfate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">&quot;Zinc sulfate: Pediatric drug information&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Because zinc supplementation has been useful in the treatment of chronic diarrhea, it has been suggested that supraphysiologic zinc replacement might be a helpful adjunct to treatment of patients with IBD. A small uncontrolled study of patients with CD in remission suggested that zinc supplementation reduced intestinal permeability, but the clinical relevance of this finding has not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Zinc is also a common component of antioxidant combinations that are occasionally given to patients with CD, although there is little evidence to support this practice.

This can occur due to the binding of calcium to undigested fats in the intestinal lumen, loss of the ileum leading to vitamin D deficiency, and possibly as a result of genetic factors and the effects of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, patients may have inadequate intake of calcium in their diets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Negative calcium balance is one of several factors contributing to bone disease in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. </p><p>The recommended intake of elemental calcium for children and adults with IBD is the same as for the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1 to 3 years &mdash; 700 mg daily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>4 to 8 years &mdash; 1000 mg daily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>9 to 18 years &mdash; 1300 mg daily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men and premenopausal women &mdash; 1000 mg daily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postmenopausal women and men older than 70 years &mdash; 1200 mg daily</p><p/><p>To minimize risks for metabolic bone disease, patients with IBD should be given focused nutritional counseling, and calcium supplements used as needed to meet the recommended target for calcium intake. This is particularly important in patients treated with glucocorticoid therapy. In patients with extensive CD of the small bowel, somewhat higher doses of calcium may be needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metabolic bone disease in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Negative calcium balance does not usually cause hypocalcemia. If the total serum calcium concentration is low, this may be caused by hypoalbuminemia, which lowers the total plasma calcium concentration without affecting the physiologically important free (ionized) calcium concentration. If the serum free calcium is low, this may be caused by concurrent vitamin D deficiency or hypoparathyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=relation-between-total-and-ionized-serum-calcium-concentrations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Relation between total and ionized serum calcium concentrations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hypocalcemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hypocalcemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The evaluation and management of IBD-associated bone disease in children differs in several respects from that in adults, as discussed separately.

However, phosphate stores can be depleted in patients with chronic diarrhea because of malabsorption of phosphate and vitamin D. In malnourished patients, sudden increases in nutrition can cause acute hypophosphatemia (refeeding syndrome). Thus, malnourished patients with CD and chronic diarrhea are at risk for hypophosphatemia and require close monitoring and phosphate replacement.
