For some vagal maneuvers, the doctor will press on a certain part of your body. For others, he or she will have you make a certain movement with your body.</p><p>Vagal maneuvers cause changes in your nervous system. Your nervous system then sends signals to your heart. These signals cause a response that affects your heartbeat.</p><p>Normally, a heartbeat happens when an electrical signal starts in a certain area in the heart. This electrical signal follows a set path to spread across the heart. As it spreads, the signal causes the heart muscle to squeeze in a normal way and at a regular rate. This causes the heartbeat.</p><p>Vagal maneuvers slow down the electrical signals that start a heartbeat. They can also slow down the electrical signals that spread across the heart. Both of these things can slow down the heartbeat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2366600500\"><span class=\"h1\">What are examples of vagal maneuvers?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many different vagal maneuvers. The 2 that doctors use most often are &quot;carotid sinus massage&quot; and the &quot;Valsalva maneuver.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2366600515\"><span class=\"h1\">What does carotid sinus massage involve?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To do carotid sinus massage, the doctor will have you lie down. Then he or she will press on a specific area in your neck. When your doctor does this, he or she is pressing on your carotid sinus. The carotid sinus lies under your skin in one of the carotid arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83850\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83850 \">figure 1</a>). The carotid arteries are the main blood vessels that bring blood to the brain. The doctor will press on your carotid sinus for about 5 to 10 seconds.</p><p>During carotid sinus massage, the doctor will monitor your blood pressure and heart activity. To monitor your heart activity, he or she will do an electrocardiogram (also called an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Carotid sinus massage slows down the heartbeat and lowers your blood pressure. This maneuver can make you feel light-headed or like you might pass out.</p><p>Doctors usually don't do carotid sinus massage in people who have certain medical conditions, including carotid artery disease. In carotid artery disease, fatty clumps called &quot;plaques&quot; build up in the carotid arteries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2366600547\"><span class=\"h1\">What does the Valsalva maneuver involve?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the Valsalva maneuver, your doctor will have you breathe in and then try to breathe out hard, keeping your mouth and nose closed. This can feel like you are &quot;bearing down&quot; and trying to have a bowel movement.</p><p>The doctor will have you hold this position for up to 10 seconds. Then you can breathe normally again. After holding your breath, the doctor might ask you to lie down and have someone hold your legs up for 15 seconds.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2366600562\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might my doctor use a vagal maneuver on me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors commonly use vagal maneuvers to diagnose or treat certain heart problems. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Different kinds of tachycardia &ndash; Tachycardia is the medical term for when the heartbeat is faster than normal. Carotid sinus massage or the Valsalva maneuver can sometimes slow down or stop tachycardia, so the heart can beat normally again.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart murmurs &ndash; The Valsalva maneuver is used in people who have a heart murmur. A heart murmur is an extra sound that doctors or nurses hear when they listen to the heart with a stethoscope. Your doctor or nurse might have you do the Valsalva maneuver when he or she listens to your heart. This will tell the doctor or nurse more about your heart murmur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A condition called &quot;heart block&quot; &ndash; In heart block, the electrical signals in the heart are slowed or stopped. Carotid sinus massage can help show your doctor where the block in your heart is.</p><p/><p>Doctors also sometimes use these maneuvers to try to find out why a person has fainted. Carotid sinus massage can show if the fainting is from a condition called &quot;carotid sinus hypersensitivity.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2366600577\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there other vagal maneuvers that doctors use?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors sometimes use other vagal maneuvers, but these are rarely done. They involve putting a person's face in a bowl of ice water, or pressing on a person's eyeball. Both of these maneuvers slow down the heartbeat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2366600592\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=carotid-artery-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Carotid artery disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-fainting-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Syncope (fainting) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tachycardia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tachycardia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-block-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart block in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-murmurs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart murmurs (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-fainting-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Syncope (fainting) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
