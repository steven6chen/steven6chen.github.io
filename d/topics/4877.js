These deep cervical space infections have become relatively uncommon in the postantibiotic era. Consequently, many clinicians are unfamiliar with these conditions. In addition, with widespread use of antibiotics <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> profound immunosuppression, the classic manifestations of these infections, such as high fever, systemic toxicity, and local signs of erythema, edema, and fluctuance, may be absent.</p><p>Deep neck space infections often have a rapid onset and can progress to life-threatening complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, clinicians must be aware of such infections and should not underestimate their potential extent or severity.</p><p>The relevant anatomy, microbial etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of deep neck space infections will be reviewed here. Peritonsillar abscesses and submandibular space infections (Ludwig's angina), suppurative parotitis, and odontogenic, middle ear, and sinus infections are discussed in detail separately.

The superficial cervical fascia consists of the subcutaneous tissues of the neck, which completely enclose the head and neck and is continuous with the platysma anteriorly.</p><p>The deep cervical fascia has three layers: superficial, middle, and deep, which can be thought of as defining a series of cylindrical compartments that extend longitudinally from the base of the skull to the mediastinum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61704 \">figure 1</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The superficial or investing layer of the deep cervical fascia encloses all of the deeper parts of the neck, beginning at the nuchal line and extending anteriorly, dividing to enclose the trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, and strap muscles as well as the submaxillary and parotid glands.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The middle or pretracheal fascia encloses the cervical viscera including the pharynx, esophagus, larynx, trachea, thyroid, and parathyroid glands. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The deep or prevertebral fascia arises from the nuchal ligament and encloses the vertebral column and muscles of the spine. The prevertebral fascia originates posteriorly on the spinous processes and encircles the splenius, erector spinae, and semispinalis muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61704 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74998\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74998 \">figure 2</a>). Prior to completing its circle anterior to the vertebral bodies, it fuses to the transverse processes. At this point, it is split into two layers: the alar fascia anteriorly and the prevertebral fascia posteriorly.</p><p/><p>All three layers of the deep cervical fascia contribute to the carotid sheath, which forms a neurovascular compartment that encloses the carotid artery, the internal jugular vein, and the vagus nerve.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Fascial spaces</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three spaces between the planes of the deep cervical fascia that are of major clinical importance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The submandibular space</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The parapharyngeal space</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The retropharyngeal space</p><p/><p>Other spaces arising from the cervical fascia with potential for deep neck infections include: the &ldquo;danger&rdquo; space, the prevertebral space, the pre-tracheal space, the peritonsillar space, and the parotid space. The masticator space, which lies lateral and anterior to the parapharyngeal space and consists of the masseteric, pterygoid, and temporal spaces, is described in detail elsewhere; infection of the masticator space arises most frequently from molar teeth, particularly the third molars (wisdom teeth). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications, diagnosis, and treatment of odontogenic infections&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Submandibular space</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The submandibular space lies within the submental and submandibular triangles between the mucosa of the floor of the mouth and the superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia. It is subdivided by the mylohyoid muscle into the sublingual space (which contains the sublingual gland, hypoglossal nerve, part of the submandibular gland, and loose connective tissue), and the submylohyoid space (also known as the submaxillary space, which contains the submandibular salivary gland and lymph nodes) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81946\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81946 \">figure 3</a>). The two divisions communicate posteriorly around the mylohyoid muscle. It is this space that is primarily involved in Ludwig&rsquo;s angina. Infection within the sublingual space results in gross swelling of the tongue that can result in acute airway obstruction. Infection of the submylohyoid space may spread posteriorly along the styloglossus muscle into the parapharyngeal space and continue to spread into the loose areolar tissue of the retropharyngeal space, and then further inferiorly into the superior mediastinum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Parapharyngeal space</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Also known as the lateral<strong> </strong>pharyngeal or pharyngomaxillary space, the parapharyngeal space is located in the lateral aspect of the neck and is shaped like an inverted cone, with its base at the skull and its apex at the hyoid bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79036\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79036 \">figure 4</a>). It lies deep to the pharyngeal constrictor muscle, and is contiguous medially with the pretracheal fascia of the visceral compartment, and laterally with the superficial fascia (which invests the parotid gland), the internal pterygoid muscle, and the mandible.</p><p>The parapharyngeal space is divided into an anterior (prestyloid or muscular) compartment and a posterior (retrostyloid or neurovascular) compartment by the styloid process and its attached muscles, the stylomandibular ligament, and the insertion of these structures into the hyoid bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79036\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79036 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>The anterior compartment contains no vital structures but rather only fat, lymph nodes, connective tissue, and muscle. It is the compartment most closely related to the tonsillar fossa and the internal pterygoid muscle. The posterior compartment contains the ninth to twelfth cranial nerves superiorly and the tenth cranial nerve more inferiorly, the carotid sheath and its contents, and the cervical sympathetic trunk. The carotid sheath, which runs in the posterior aspect of the parapharyngeal space, pierces the cone at its apex to enter the mediastinum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79036\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79036 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>Infection of the parapharyngeal space may result from pharyngitis, tonsillitis, parotitis, otitis, or mastoiditis, as well as odontogenic infections, especially if the masticator space is involved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications, diagnosis, and treatment of odontogenic infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Retropharyngeal space</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The retropharyngeal space is bound anteriorly by the constrictor muscles of the neck and posteriorly by the alar layer of the deep cervical fascia. It is situated behind the hypopharynx and the esophagus, and lies between the alar fascia posteriorly and the posterior aspect of the pretracheal fascia anteriorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61704 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74998\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74998 \">figure 2</a>). It communicates with the parapharyngeal space laterally where the carotid sheaths reside.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H988692066\"><span class=\"h3\">Danger space</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Posterior to the retropharyngeal space is the danger space, which is bound by the alar fascia anteriorly and the prevertebral fascia posteriorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61704 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74998\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74998 \">figure 2</a>). It extends from the base of the skull and descends freely through the entire posterior mediastinum to the level of the diaphragm (T1 to T2) where the two fascial layers fuse. Thus, the danger space provides the most important anatomic route for contiguous spread between the neck and the chest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H988692074\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevertebral space</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevertebral space is bound by the prevertebral fascia, which originates posteriorly on the spinous processes and encircles the splenius, erector spinae, and semispinalis muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61704 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74998\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74998 \">figure 2</a>). Prior to completing its circle anterior to the vertebral bodies, it fuses to the transverse processes. At this point, it is split into two layers: the alar fascia anteriorly and the prevertebral fascia posteriorly. The prevertebral space extends from the base of the skull to the coccyx, thus allowing organisms to spread as far down as the psoas muscle sheath.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1792494\"><span class=\"h3\">Pretracheal space</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pretracheal space comprises the anterior portion of the visceral compartment and completely surrounds the trachea and esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61704 \">figure 1</a>). It is contiguous with the carotid sheath laterally and with the superior mediastinum inferiorly. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H988692083\"><span class=\"h3\">Peritonsillar space</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The peritonsillar space lies between the capsule of the palatine (faucial) tonsil medially, the superior constrictor muscle laterally, and the tonsillar pillars anteriorly and posteriorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53388\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53388 \">figure 5</a>). A dreaded complication of a peritonsillar abscess (Quinsy) is to rupture through the superior constrictor muscle and extend directly into the parapharyngeal space, which lies posterior to the tonsillar bed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H988692090\"><span class=\"h3\">Parotid space</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The parotid space is formed by the splitting of the investing fascia at the level of the stylomandibular ligament to enclose the parotid gland within a superficial capsule and a deep capsule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65210\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65210 \">figure 6</a>). The superficial capsule is thick and strong, tightly adherent to the superficial pole of the parotid gland. The deep capsule adjacent to the dorsal lobe of the parotid gland, however, is thin and infection in the gland can easily penetrate through this capsule and extend through the stylomandibular tunnel into the parapharyngeal space. The stylomandibular ligament effectively separates the parotid space from the submylohyoid space. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymph nodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lymph nodes of the head and neck can be divided into 10 principal groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69528\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69528 \">figure 7</a>). Six of these (occipital, mastoid, parotid, facial, submandibular, and submental nodes) form a collar at the junction of the head and neck. Within this collar, the sublingual and retropharyngeal nodes lie near the base of the tongue. The anterior and lateral cervical nodes form a chain along the front and side of the neck, respectively. The lateral cervical chain serves as a common root for drainage. The final conduit from all lymphatics in the head and neck is the large deep chain situated along the carotid sheath. When inflamed, these nodes become adherent to the fascial sheath of the vessels; thus, a suppurative infection of the cervical lymph nodes may frequently invade the bloodstream.</p><p>In addition to the regional lymph nodes of the head and neck, both the nasopharynx and the oropharynx are richly endowed with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues similar to the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues and the gut-associated lymphoid tissues. In particular, the aggregation of lymphoid tissues surrounding the nasopharynx is known as Waldeyer's ring and comprises the palatine, lingual, adenoidal, and tonsillar lymphoid tissues. Acute inflammation involving these tissues, such as during acute tonsillopharyngitis, croup, otitis media, retropharyngeal abscess or Epstein-Barr virus mononucleosis, may result in acute airway compromise and constitutes a medical emergency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential routes of spread</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The deep cervical fascial spaces are normally bound together by loose connective tissue and intercommunicate to varied degrees. The potential pathways of extension from one space to another are illustrated in the accompanying figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64597\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64597 \">figure 8</a>). A thorough understanding of the potential anatomic routes of infection not only provides valuable information on the nature and extent of infection but also suggests the optimal surgical approach for effective drainage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deep neck space infections are typically polymicrobial and represent the normal resident flora of the contiguous mucosal surfaces from which the infection originated. Due to the close anatomic relationships, the resident flora of the oral cavity, upper respiratory tract, and certain parts of the ears and eyes share many common organisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56883\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56883 \">figure 9</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although as many as 50 to 100 bacterial species may be present on the oral or nasopharyngeal mucosal surface, the typical deep neck space infection includes, on average, five or six bacterial types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Anaerobes generally outnumber aerobes on all mucosal surfaces<strong> </strong>of the oral cavity<strong> </strong>by a factor of 10:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>The most common organisms isolated from deep neck space infections are viridans streptococci, reflecting their abundance in the mouth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Most abscesses originating from the teeth also harbor oral anaerobes, including <em>Peptostreptococcus </em>species, <em>Fusobacterium nucleatum</em>, pigmented <em>Prevotella</em> species such as <em>Prevotella melaninogenica</em> (formerly <em>Bacteroides melaninogenicus</em>), and <em>Actinomyces</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Additional organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus and facultative gram-negative rods, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, may be present, particularly in patients with risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Immunocompromised hosts (eg, patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia) are particularly likely to harbor such pathogens, but those with diabetes mellitus, postoperative infection, or trauma are also at increased risk.</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> has been frequently isolated from deep neck space infections in Taiwan, particularly from diabetic patients. This species is a more common pathogen in various infections in Southeast Asia than in most other regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/10,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of Klebsiella pneumoniae infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Infections arising from the pharynx frequently contain oral anaerobes and facultative streptococci, particularly Streptococcus pyogenes. In a study of 847 patients with peritonsillar abscess, Fusobacterium necrophorum was the most commonly detected species (23 percent), followed by S. pyogenes (17 percent), and group C or G streptococci (5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-streptococcal-tonsillopharyngitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Infections of the prevertebral space usually originate from contiguous spread of a cervical spine infection (such as discitis or vertebral osteomyelitis), by local instrumentation of the trachea or esophagus, or by hematogenous seeding. There is a predominance of gram-positive organisms, the most common being Staphylococcus aureus. Less common organisms include various facultative gram-negative bacilli, mycobacteria, and fungi. Intravenous drug use, immunosuppression, alcoholism, and diabetes mellitus are known risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Thus, the microbiology of prevertebral space infections is quite different from that of retropharyngeal or odontogenic deep neck infections. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deep neck space infections share some typical clinical features. It is important to consider the primary source of infection (ie, odontogenic versus non-odontogenic, oropharyngeal, otogenic, or rhinogenic) and special host factors (such as comorbid disease, hospitalization, antecedent surgery or trauma, or immunocompromised state). In patients who have undergone radical neck surgery or radiation to the neck for cancer, diffuse cellulitis and lymphedema may be a prominent clinical feature. Similarly, in patients who have undergone tracheostomy and prolonged mechanical ventilation, a tracheo-esophageal fistula may develop with spread of infection into the mediastinum. Patients in the intensive care unit with prolonged internal jugular central venous catheters may develop suppurative thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein (variant of Lemierre&rsquo;s syndrome). </p><p>Each of the major deep neck space infections are discussed in greater detail below or in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Specific deep neck space infections'</a> below.) </p><p>Because of the dense superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia and its musculofascial planes, a fluctuant mass is not readily appreciated in deep neck space infections. Palpation of the oral cavity, when possible, may help in identifying such a mass or focal tenderness. The characteristic signs of deep pus are pitting or a doughy feeling on firm deep palpation.</p><p>Specific sites of infection are often associated with characteristic clinical manifestations and physical findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritonsillar, parotid, parapharyngeal, and submandibular abscesses are generally associated with sore throat and trismus (the inability to open the jaw). Trismus indicates pressure or infection affecting the muscles of mastication (the masseter and the pterygoids) or involvement of the motor branch of the trigeminal nerve. Findings on physical examination include swelling of the face and neck, erythema, and purulent oral discharge. There may be pooling of saliva in the mouth and asymmetry of the oropharynx. Lymphadenopathy is usually present. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysphagia and odynophagia are secondary to inflammation of the cricoarytenoid joints.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysphonia and hoarseness are late findings in neck infections and may indicate involvement of the tenth cranial nerve</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral tongue paresis indicates involvement of the twelfth cranial nerve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stridor and dyspnea signify airway obstruction and may be manifestations of local pressure or spread of infection to the mediastinum.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H988692187\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) is the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of deep neck space infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. CT allows the critical evaluation of soft tissues and especially bone from a single exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51505\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51505 \">image 1</a>). In addition, the axial imaging format of CT is particularly well suited to the head and neck. Because CT can localize a process and define its extent, particularly extension into the mediastinum or the cranial vault, it is also an invaluable tool for planning and guiding aspiration for culture or open drainage. </p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful for assessing the extent of soft tissue involvement and for delineating vascular complications. However, MRI takes significantly longer than CT to obtain good quality images, which may cause discomfort or claustrophobia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In addition, individuals with certain implanted devices cannot undergo MRI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of magnetic resonance imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Plain radiography is of limited utility for the evaluation of deep neck space infections; it is sometimes helpful for detecting retropharyngeal swelling or epiglottitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H990948194\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features and diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC DEEP NECK SPACE INFECTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H990950053\"><span class=\"h2\">Peritonsillar abscess (quinsy)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peritonsillar abscess, also known as quinsy, is a suppurative complication of acute tonsillitis with extension into the peritonsillar space. The latter consists of loose areolar tissue overlying the tonsil and is surrounded by the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle and the anterior and posterior tonsillar pillars. Peritonsillar abscesses may affect patients of all ages but are most common among young adults between the ages of 15 and 30 years. The infection begins as a cellulitis and progresses to abscess formation, most commonly near the superior pole of the tonsil. Patients complain of high fever, odynophagia, unilateral sore throat, and otalgia. Classic signs include a muffled voice, trismus, unilateral deviation of the uvula towards the unaffected side, and soft palate fullness or edema. The oral airway may be compromised and drooling may occur. Peritonsillar abscesses are often polymicrobial. The predominant bacterial species are Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) and oral anaerobes. Peritonsillar abscess is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritonsillar-cellulitis-and-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peritonsillar cellulitis and abscess&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H990950079\"><span class=\"h2\">Parotid space infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute suppurative parotitis is characterized by the sudden onset of unilateral induration and erythema that extends from the cheek to the angle of the jaw. The parotid gland becomes swollen and extremely tender. Purulent discharge may be expressed by gentle compression around the orifice of the parotid duct (Stensen's duct). Although a stone obstructing the salivary duct may predispose to bacterial infection, inspissated secretions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stasis are more common predisposing features. Three factors that predispose to suppurative parotitis are: acutely diminished salivary flow, poor oral hygiene, and increased susceptibility to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, acute suppurative parotitis is typically seen in elderly, debilitated, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dehydrated patients who may be diabetic or taking anticholinergic medications that decrease salivary flow. </p><p>The microbiology of acute suppurative parotitis is quite variable and is often polymicrobial. Staphylococcus aureus is by far the most frequently isolated pathogen, but anaerobes are also common. Acute suppurative parotitis is discussed in more detail elsewhere.

The clinical presentation is characterized by severe dyspnea, but hoarseness may be the first complaint. Swallowing may be difficult, and fluids may be regurgitated through the nose. A pretracheal space infection is always serious because of impending airway obstruction and possible extension into the mediastinum. Prompt surgical drainage is critical to prevent such complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H990950098\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevertebral space infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections of the prevertebral space usually originate from contiguous spread of a cervical spine infection (such as discitis or vertebral osteomyelitis), by local instrumentation of the trachea or esophagus, or by hematogenous seeding. There is a predominance of gram-positive organisms, the most common being Staphylococcus aureus. Less common organisms include various facultative gram-negative bacilli, mycobacteria, and fungi. Intravenous drug use, immunosuppression, alcoholism, and diabetes mellitus are known risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Thus, the microbiology of prevertebral space infections is quite different from that of retropharyngeal or odontogenic deep neck infections. </p><p>The diagnosis of a prevertebral space infection may be difficult to make clinically because only 75 percent of patients complain of back or neck pain, 50 percent present with fever, and one-third have neurologic deficits ranging from nerve root pain to paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is immensely helpful for differentiating a prevertebral space infection from a retropharyngeal abscess. Complications of prevertebral space infections arise from spinal epidural collections that cause cord compression. Irreversible paralysis occurs in 4 to 22 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Spread of infection to or from the disc or vertebrae may cause local destruction with mechanical instability of the spine. Since the prevertebral space extends from the base of the skull down to the coccyx and is contiguous with the psoas muscle sheath, seemingly distant abscesses can form within the psoas muscle in a patient who has a prevertebral space infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H990947868\"><span class=\"h2\">Parapharyngeal space infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parapharyngeal space infections are potentially life-threatening because of the possibility of involving the carotid sheath and its vital contents (eg, common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, vagus nerve), propensity for airway impingement, and bacteremic dissemination. Since the clinical presentation may be dominated by the symptoms and signs of the primary source of infection, the diagnosis of parapharyngeal space involvement is often delayed.</p><p>Infection of the parapharyngeal space may arise from different sources throughout the neck. Dental infections are the most common underlying cause, followed by peritonsillar abscess, and rarely parotitis, otitis, or mastoiditis (Bezold's abscess).

The carotid sheath abuts all three layers of the deep cervical fascia.

The patient presents either in a toxic condition or insidiously with a fever of undetermined origin. Trismus is absent, and signs of local suppuration may be subtle initially because of the tight connective tissue around and within the carotid sheath. In some patients, there is diffuse swelling along the sternocleidomastoid muscle with marked tenderness and torticollis to the opposite side.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Carotid artery mycotic aneurysms have a mortality rate of approximately 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Erosion of the carotid artery is a potentially devastating complication. This complication arises from an arteritis due to contiguous inflammation, resulting eventually in the formation of a false aneurysm, which may rupture. Erosion and rupture of the carotid artery may be heralded by recurrent small hemorrhages from the nose, mouth, or ear (&quot;herald bleeds&quot;). This is followed by hematoma formation in the surrounding tissues, a protracted clinical course, and eventually the onset of shock due to exsanguination. Ligation of the carotid artery may be necessary in cases of major hemorrhage, but the mortality rate remains high, and the risk of stroke is significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Suppurative jugular thrombophlebitis &mdash; </strong>Suppurative jugular thrombophlebitis (also known as Lemierre's syndrome or postanginal sepsis) should be suspected in patients with antecedent pharyngitis, septic pulmonary emboli, and persistent fever despite antimicrobial therapy.

Penetrating trauma (eg, from chicken bones or following instrumentation) is the usual source of local spread; in such cases, a sore throat or difficulty in swallowing or breathing may be the first indication of infection. More distant sources of infection include odontogenic sepsis and peritonsillar abscess (now a rare cause). Infection from these sources may often obscure the diagnosis of a retropharyngeal abscess because of associated trismus, which makes direct examination of the posterior pharyngeal wall difficult.</p><p>The differential diagnosis includes cervical osteomyelitis, Pott's disease, meningitis, and calcific tendonitis of the long muscle of the neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F106533\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106533 \">figure 10</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-neck-space-infections/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In this setting, CT scans <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> x-rays of the lateral neck are especially helpful and may demonstrate cervical lordosis with swelling and gas collections in the retropharyngeal space, causing anterior displacement of the larynx and trachea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65501\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65501 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51505\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51505 \">image 1</a>). The radiograph should be evaluated for increased thickness of the prevertebral soft tissues, air or air-fluid levels, and the presence of foreign bodies. The soft tissues of the posterior wall of the hypopharynx are normally about 5 mm deep, less than one third the diameter of the fourth cervical vertebra (C4). In the presence of a retropharyngeal space infection, the pharynx or upper airway is displaced anteriorly by more than one half the width of the C4 vertebral body.

It should be noted that the primary pathologic finding in deep neck space infections is cellulitis that involves the connective tissues, fasciae, and muscles, and frequently undergoes necrosis. This necrotizing cellulitis results in a serosanguinous, putrid infiltration of the cervical tissues, usually with little or no frank pus present. During this stage of infection, treatment is primarily medical, directed at eradicating the causative microorganisms and preventing local or systemic spread of infection. Maximum doses of systemic antimicrobials should be administered in order to optimize tissue penetration. Surgical drainage should be implemented only if the cellulitic process has localized into a discrete abscess. Premature incision into an area of cellulitis area may actually worsen the situation by breaking down the natural defenses and hastening the spread of infection. The choice of antimicrobial regimens for the treatment of deep neck space infections has not been evaluated in clinical trials. </p><p>Empiric regimens are based upon the expected microbiology and immune status of the host, and coverage should be narrowed if microbiologic data become available. The antibiotic doses recommended below are intended for patients with normal renal function; dosing of many of these agents must be reduced in patients with renal dysfunction.</p><p>For patients who have airway impingement from a deep neck space infection, maintenance of an adequate airway is a primary concern (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of central airway obstruction in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-evaluation-of-acute-upper-airway-obstruction-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency evaluation of acute upper airway obstruction in children&quot;</a>).

Since these infections often have a rapid onset and may progress to life-threatening complications, clinicians must be aware of such infections and should not underestimate their potential extent or severity. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knowledge of the cervical compartments and interfascial spaces is essential for understanding the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and potential routes of spread of infections involving these spaces. The deep cervical fascia has three layers: superficial, middle, and deep, which can be thought of as defining a series of cylindrical compartments that extend longitudinally from the base of the skull to the mediastinum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61704 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic considerations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Potential routes of spread'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep neck space infections are typically polymicrobial and represent the normal resident flora of the contiguous mucosal surfaces from which the infection originated. Due to the close anatomic relationships, the resident flora of the oral cavity, upper respiratory tract, and certain parts of the ears and eyes share many common organisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56883\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56883 \">figure 9</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common organisms isolated from deep neck space infections are viridans streptococci, reflecting their abundance in the mouth. Most abscesses originating from the teeth also harbor oral anaerobes, including <em>Peptostreptococcus</em> species, <em>Fusobacterium</em> <em>nucleatum</em>, pigmented <em>Prevotella</em> species such as <em>Prevotella</em> <em>melaninogenica</em> (formerly <em>Bacteroides</em> <em>melaninogenicus</em>), and <em>Actinomyces</em> species. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography is the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of deep neck space infections. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful for assessing the extent of soft tissue involvement and for delineating vascular complications. (See <a href=\"#H988692187\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For deep neck space infections that involve a drainable collection, aspiration or surgical drainage should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate antibiotics based upon the likely microbiology of the infection are essential for a successful outcome of deep neck space infections. Empiric regimens for each type of deep neck space infection are discussed above (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77338\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77338 \">table 2</a>). The final selection of antimicrobial therapy should be guided by culture results and susceptibility data, whenever possible. (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For both<strong> </strong>immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients who are at risk for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriage or infection, such as those with a history of intravenous drug use or comorbid disease (eg, diabetes mellitus), or those in communities or hospitals where there is a substantial incidence of MRSA, we suggest that MRSA coverage be included in the treatment regimen (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For parapharyngeal, retropharyngeal, or prevertebral space infections, therapy should generally be continued for two to three weeks. Longer courses are required when complications are present. (See <a href=\"#H990947868\" class=\"local\">'Parapharyngeal space infections'</a> above and <a href=\"#H990948187\" class=\"local\">'Retropharyngeal and danger space infections'</a> above and <a href=\"#H990950301\" class=\"local\">'Prevertebral space infections'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Chow AW.
