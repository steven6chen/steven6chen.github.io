In the United States, it is estimated that there is a 5 to 10 percent lifetime risk for women undergoing surgery for a suspected ovarian neoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-adnexal-mass/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Adnexal masses may be found in females of all ages, fetuses to the elderly, and there is a wide variety of types of masses. Pathology in this area may also arise from the uterus, bowel, retroperitoneum, or metastatic disease from another site, such as the gastrointestinal tract or breast.</p><p>Evaluation of an adnexal mass relies primarily on pelvic ultrasound, with additional information from history, physical examination, and laboratory tests; patients may require surgical evaluation or treatment.</p><p>The different types of adnexal masses are reviewed here.

There are many different types of adnexal masses. The type of mass is identified with pelvic imaging, use of biomarkers, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgical exploration and pathologic evaluation.</p><p>Most adnexal masses arise from the ovary or fallopian tube. However, other gynecologic structures may give rise to an adnexal mass, including the mesovarium or mesosalpinx (eg, paratubal cysts). Uterine leiomyomas may protrude toward the adnexa and be palpated or visualized as an adnexal mass. In addition, adnexal masses may arise from other proximal structures, including the urinary tract (eg, bladder diverticulum), bowel (eg, appendiceal abscess, diverticular abscess, bowel neoplasm), or pelvic connective tissue (eg, peritoneal cyst) or nerves (nerve sheath tumor). The types of adnexal masses are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107713\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107713 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>In terms of frequency, the distribution of histologic types of adnexal masses in an international cross-section study from the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) group of over 4848 women is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F109383\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109383 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-adnexal-mass/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Some adnexal masses require immediate attention; these include ectopic pregnancy, adnexal torsion, a ruptured ovarian cyst with hemorrhage, or a tubo-ovarian abscess. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass#H3884018\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with an adnexal mass&quot;, section on 'Evaluation for urgent conditions'</a>.)</p><p>A serious concern when an adnexal mass is discovered is the possibility that it is malignant. The differential diagnosis of benign and malignant neoplastic masses is discussed below. The evaluation for a malignant neoplasm in an adnexal mass, including the sonographic features of malignant neoplasms and use of biomarkers, is discussed in detail separately. A consensus paper from the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound in 2010 indicated that transvaginal ultrasound, supplemented by transabdominal ultrasound, was the best technique for imaging and characterizing an adnexal cyst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-adnexal-mass/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The supporting structures of the ovaries include the utero-ovarian ligament that attaches the ovary to the uterus; the infundibulopelvic ligament (also referred to as the suspensory ligament of the ovary), through which the ovarian vessels travel, that attaches the ovary to the pelvic sidewall; and the broad ligament, which condenses to form the mesovarium. It is also attached to the broad ligament through the mesovarium.</p><p>The ovary consists of an outer cortex, where the ova and follicles are located, and a medulla, where the blood vessels and connective tissue compose a fibromuscular tissue layer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77045 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The fallopian tubes arise from the uterine corpus posterior and superior to the round ligaments. The broad ligaments support the tubes with a condensation of connective tissue called the mesosalpinx.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H281003818\"><span class=\"h2\">Histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ovary includes several different tissue types. The most common neoplasms are epithelial. These derive from the stem cells that would typically give rise to fallopian tube epithelium (most high-grade serous carcinomas), or ovarian surface epithelium and inclusions (eg, cystadenomas). Ovarian germ cell tumors are derived from primordial germ cells of the ovary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72286\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72286 \">figure 3</a>). Ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors derive from stem cells that would normally give rise to supporting epithelial cells, including ovarian stroma (eg, fibromas) and follicles (eg, granulosa cell tumors, Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors).</p><p>The fallopian tubes consist of an outer muscularis layer of the tube with longitudinal smooth muscle fibers and an inner layer with circular fibers. The fallopian tube mucosa is composed of numerous delicate papillary folds (plica) consisting of three cell types: ciliated columnar cells; nonciliated, columnar secretory cells; and intercalated cells, which may simply represent inactive secretory cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-adnexal-mass/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Pelvic anatomy and histology is discussed in detail separately.

The likely etiology of an adnexal mass differs by age and reproductive status. This is because some masses are stimulated by reproductive hormones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetuses, children, and adolescents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Follicular ovarian cysts are common in fetuses and increase in frequency with advancing gestational age and with some maternal complications (eg, diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, rhesus isoimmunization).</p><p>A pelvic mass in a newborn is most likely a physiologic cyst that initially arose due to maternal hormonal stimulation in utero. The differential diagnosis of an intra-abdominal mass in fetuses or neonates includes genitourinary tract disorders (eg, reproductive tract anomalies, urinary tract obstruction, urachal cyst), gastrointestinal tract disorders (eg, mesenteric or omental cyst, volvulus, colonic atresia, intestinal duplication), or miscellaneous disorders (eg, choledochal, splenic, or pancreatic cyst, lymphangioma).</p><p>Between the neonatal period and puberty, physiologic cysts are uncommon because gonadotropin ovarian stimulation decreases in infancy and early childhood and then increases during puberty. Nevertheless, most simple ovarian cysts in children are physiologic and result from enlargement of a cystic follicle.</p><p>Girls between menarche and 18 years of age constitute an age group in which the development of both simple and complex cysts is quite common. Adolescent ovaries may contain multiple follicles in different stages of development. Most simple cysts result from failure of the maturing follicle to ovulate and involute.</p><p>Ovarian neoplasms (benign and malignant) account for approximately 1 percent of all tumors in children and adolescents. Most ovarian masses are physiologic or benign neoplasms; fewer than 5 percent of ovarian cancers occur in this age group.</p><p>Ovarian cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in women &le;25 years of age, and germ cell tumors are the most common histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-adnexal-mass/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Germ cell tumors compose one-half to two-thirds of ovarian neoplasms in girls up to 18 years of age compared with 20 percent of ovarian neoplasms in adult women. In girls younger than nine years of age, approximately 80 percent of ovarian neoplasms are malignant. Epithelial neoplasms are rare in the prepubertal age group.</p><p>The etiology, diagnosis, and management of ovarian neoplasms from the fetal to adolescent age group are reviewed separately.

Adnexal masses stimulated by reproductive hormones are found almost exclusively in this age group. These include physiologic cysts, endometriomas, and leiomyomas. Ovarian or tubal malignant neoplasms are uncommon in this age group, although the peak age for ovarian germ cell tumors is between ages 10 and 30 years.</p><p>Adnexal masses in the reproductive age women that are associated with reproductive hormones include some that result from an aspect of the menstrual cycle, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Functional/physiologic</span> cysts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corpus luteal cyst</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Theca lutein cyst</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polycystic ovaries</p><p/><p>Other types of masses are stimulated by reproductive hormones:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometrioma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine leiomyoma</p><p/><p>Premenopausal women may develop benign or malignant neoplastic adnexal masses.

In general, ovarian or tubal cancers increase in incidence with increasing age and so are more common in postmenopausal women. However, ovarian germ cell tumors (eg, teratomas) arise primarily in young women between 10 and 30 years of age; they represent 70 percent of ovarian neoplasms in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-adnexal-mass/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H889225245\"><span class=\"h3\">Ovulatory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some adnexal masses are associated with normal or abnormal ovulatory function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Functional or corpus luteal cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the process of normal ovulation, a follicle develops to maturity and then ruptures to release an ovum; this is followed by formation and subsequent involution of the corpus luteum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62189\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62189 \">figure 4</a>).

These cysts are therefore called physiologic or functional. Either type may become hemorrhagic.</p><p>Follicular cysts appear smooth, thin-walled, and unilocular on ultrasound examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F109386\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef109386 \">image 1</a>), while corpus luteum cysts can look complex and grossly are yellow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F109387\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef109387 \">image 2</a>). Simple cysts &lt;3 cm in diameter are considered to be normal physiologic cysts. Physiologic cysts can become quite large but are usually less than 10 cm in size. Although simple cysts are most likely benign, there are no data to support which asymptomatic simple cysts are to be followed and which can be ignored.

Cystic degeneration of a fibroid can result in the appearance of a complex mass on ultrasound. This, coupled with the fact that fibroids can cause an elevation in the serum CA 125 concentration, results in further concern that the mass may be a malignant ovarian neoplasm. Transvaginal imaging is key to differentiating between a leiomyoma in the adnexa from a solid ovarian tumor. First, the ovary must be found intact, normal, and completely separate from the leiomyoma. Also, Doppler flow can be used to see the vascular communication between the uterus and the pedunculated leiomyoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H168148565\"><span class=\"h3\">Infectious or inflammatory</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h4\">Tubo-ovarian abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) is an inflammatory mass involving the fallopian tube, ovary, and, occasionally, other adjacent pelvic organs (eg, bowel, bladder). This may manifest as a tubo-ovarian complex (an agglutination of those structures) or a collection of pus (TOA). These abscesses are found most commonly in reproductive age women and typically result from upper genital tract infection. TOA is usually a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).</p><p>Findings of abdominopelvic pain, fever, purulent cervical discharge, and cervical motion tenderness in association with an adnexal mass suggest a diagnosis of TOA.

The most common types of benign neoplasms in reproductive-age women are cystadenoma, Brenner tumor, and mature cystic teratoma (dermoid cyst). Mature cystic teratomas are a type of germ cell tumor; these ovarian neoplasms are found most commonly in women ages 10 to 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-adnexal-mass/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H466945734\"><span class=\"h4\">Serous or mucinous cystadenoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serous and mucinous cystadenomas are among the most common benign ovarian neoplasms. They are thin-walled, uni- or multilocular, and range in size from 5 to &lt;20 cm.</p><p>Compared with serous cystadenomas, mucinous cystadenomas occur less frequently, are more likely to be multiloculated, are larger (they can attain an enormous size), and are less often bilateral (less than 5 versus 20 to 25 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F109390\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109390 \">table 3</a>). A definitive diagnosis depends on pathologic evaluation to determine the cell type lining the cysts. Serous lining is similar to fallopian tube lining and mucinous lining cells collect mucin in their cytoplasm and resemble either endocervical or gastrointestinal epithelium.</p><p>Many of these tumors are asymptomatic and found incidentally on pelvic examination or with ultrasound. As the masses grow they can cause pressure or pain, bloating, and urinary symptoms and can present with ovarian torsion.</p><p>Benign-appearing masses that are persistently symptomatic should be removed. There are no data regarding the decision to observe or remove these benign-appearing cystic masses if they are asymptomatic. In our experience, several factors play a role in this important treatment decision, including age, size of the mass, ultrasound appearance, family history or other risk factors for ovarian cancer, and medical comorbidities. If the patient is a good candidate for surgery, it is reasonable to remove such masses due to uncertain future behavior. If the patient is not a good candidate for surgery or removal is not felt to be strongly indicated due to the other factors discussed above, then observation may be considered with serial ultrasound examinations to assess for stability and changes suspicious for malignant transformation. There are no data to support the frequency of repeat ultrasound examinations if the management plan is observation. A repeat ultrasound in six months is reasonable and then yearly thereafter if the mass is stable with benign features. The International Ovarian Tumor Analysis group (IOTA) is collecting data for part 5 of a large prospective international observational study to evaluate this question. Data are being collected through 2017, and benign-appearing adnexal masses will be observed with transvaginal ultrasound with the goal of collecting data that will allow development of a protocol regarding observation of benign-appearing adnexal masses.

In a retrospective study of 59 women who underwent surgery for cystic paraovarian lesions, 75 percent had simple cysts and 25 percent had neoplastic lesions (seven cystadenomas and eight cystadenofibromas); there were no malignant neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-adnexal-mass/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A primary malignancy deriving from the paratubal or paraovarian lesions is rare; a literature review found 14 reports of malignant or borderline paraovarian epithelial neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-adnexal-mass/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]; however, metastatic malignancies often involve the paraovarian or paratubal tissues.</p><p>These cysts are usually discovered incidentally during pelvic sonography or surgery. There are no data regarding whether these cysts, either benign or malignant, are more common in pre- or postmenopausal women. The key to diagnosis is a simple cyst seen adjacent to a normal ovary.

Surgery is usually not necessary unless symptoms become severe. If the cyst is large or symptomatic, it should be removed surgically. This can typically be achieved laparoscopically. As with larger ovarian cysts, a paratubal cyst may result in torsion of the adnexa and acute severe pain requiring emergent surgical intervention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F109397\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109397 \">picture 3B</a>).</p><p>It is often difficult to distinguish between a paratubal cyst and an exophytic simple ovarian cyst as they can look similar on ultrasound.

Symptoms include fever, abdominal pain (usually left lower quadrant), nausea and vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, and urinary symptoms. Diverticular disease should be considered in the older woman who presents with fever, left-sided pelvic pain, and a pelvic mass on pelvic or ultrasound examination.</p><p>In a patient with constipation, a somewhat firm, usually mobile adnexal mass may be palpated on pelvic examination.

The typical presentation is a patient with prior surgery (especially hysterectomy) or history of inflammation (pelvic inflammatory disease) with a cystic mass seen on transvaginal ultrasound that is not clearly palpable. The ultrasound appearance includes pockets of fluid in the pelvis separated by filmy adhesions which can move (&quot;flapping sails&quot; sign). Often the ovary, if present, is contained within the loculated fluid, which conforms to surrounding pelvic structures and sidewalls. There is generally an irregular-shaped exterior border rather than round cyst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-adnexal-mass/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. If the clinical scenario and findings on imaging are consistent with a peritoneal inclusion cyst, then no intervention is indicated and surveillance with serial imaging may be performed. Resolution of the loculated fluid or reduction of the volume may be seen over time as this is peritoneal fluid trapped within filmy adhesions.</p><p>Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare neoplasm of the serosal membranes of the pleura, peritoneum, pericardium, or tunica vaginalis testes. The disease distribution is typically diffuse, but localized disease may occur and could potentially be detected as an adnexal mass. There are no signs or symptoms that are specific for malignant peritoneal mesothelioma.

Women with a hemorrhagic cyst may be asymptomatic or may present with mild to severe pelvic pain. If the patient is stable and bleeding is not ongoing, then the patient may be managed expectantly. Ultrasound features typically include a cystic mass with internal echoes, which vary depending on the evolution of a blood clot. There may be a fluid level if there has been fresh bleeding or a blood clot that appears as an avascular solid internal mass. Or there can be &quot;cobweb&quot; internal echoes as the blood clot resolves. Hemorrhagic cysts or hemorrhagic corpus luteum cysts usually occur with ovulatory dysfunction. Patients who are on anticoagulation are at increased risk.

The fallopian tube often twists along with the ovary; when this occurs, it is referred to as adnexal torsion. The primary risk factor for ovarian torsion is an ovarian mass and is most common if the ovary is 5 cm or larger.</p><p>Pelvic ultrasound is the first-line imaging study for patients with suspected ovarian torsion and will identify a mass or cyst that is usually 5 to 10 cm. Power Doppler can be used to evaluate blood flow to the ovary, but the diagnosis and decision for surgery is a clinical one. Blood flow will be seen unless the torsion involves complete obstruction of the supplying vessels, so observing blood flow to the ovary does not rule out adnexal torsion. A definitive diagnosis of ovarian torsion is made by direct visualization of a rotated ovary at the time of surgical evaluation.

Adnexal masses may be found in females of all ages, fetuses to elderly. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mass in the adnexa may be symptomatic or discovered incidentally on pelvic examination or imaging. The type of mass is determined with pelvic imaging, use of biomarkers, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgical exploration and pathologic evaluation. Some adnexal masses require immediate attention, these include ectopic pregnancy, adnexal torsion, a ruptured ovarian cyst with hemorrhage, or a tubo-ovarian abscess. A serious concern is that possibility that an adnexal mass is malignant neoplasm. (See <a href=\"#H3013933022\" class=\"local\">'Clinical approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiology is usually a primary process of the ovary or fallopian tube but may involve the broad ligament, uterus, bowel, or retroperitoneum, or metastatic neoplasm or infection from another site, such as the breast or gastrointestinal tract. Adnexal masses may be benign or malignant neoplasms or non-neoplastic. The differential diagnosis of an adnexal mass varies according to age and menopausal status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107713\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107713 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3013933022\" class=\"local\">'Clinical approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ovarian neoplasms derive from the three different ovarian cell types. The most common ovarian neoplasms are epithelial. These derive from the stem cells that would typically give rise to fallopian tube epithelium (most high-grade serous carcinomas), or ovarian surface epithelium and inclusions (eg, cystadenomas). Ovarian germ cell tumors are derived from primordial germ cells of the ovary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72286\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72286 \">figure 3</a>). Ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors derive from stem cells that would normally give rise to supporting epithelial cells, including ovarian stroma (eg, fibromas) and follicles (eg, granulosa cell tumors, Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors). (See <a href=\"#H281003818\" class=\"local\">'Histology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ovarian neoplasms (benign and malignant) account for approximately 1 percent of all tumors in children and adolescents. Most ovarian masses are physiologic or benign neoplasms; fewer than 5 percent of ovarian cancers occur in this age group. Germ cell tumors are the most common histologic type of ovarian cancer in children and adolescents. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Fetuses, children, and adolescents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a broad differential diagnosis of an adnexal mass in women of reproductive age. Adnexal masses stimulated by reproductive hormones are found almost exclusively in this age group. These include physiologic cysts (eg follicular cyst, corpus luteal cyst), endometriomas, and leiomyomas. Ovarian or tubal malignant neoplasms are uncommon in this age group, although the peak age for ovarian germ cell tumors is between ages 10 and 30 years. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Premenopausal women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a high index of suspicion for ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women with an adnexal mass. At least 30 percent of ovarian masses in women over age 50 are malignant neoplasms. Nonmalignant etiologies of an adnexal mass in postmenopausal women include many of those also seen in patients of reproductive age. Simple cysts are common in this age group and are rarely malignant. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Postmenopausal women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nongynecologic sources of adnexal masses include metastatic disease from nongynecologic primary sites (eg, gastrointestinal, breast), pelvic abscess, and other pelvic or retroperitoneal masses (eg, peritoneal inclusion cyst, nerve sheath tumor, bladder diverticulum). (See <a href=\"#H590904173\" class=\"local\">'Nongynecologic masses'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-adnexal-mass/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement.
