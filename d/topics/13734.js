The double-cuff straight Tenckhoff catheter, a silicone catheter with a straight (as opposed to coiled) intra-abdominal portion, is the most commonly used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The Missouri Swan Neck catheter and the Toronto Western catheter have also been used extensively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Most available catheters are made of silicone. Although polyurethane catheters are also available (eg, the Cruz catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]), there is limited long-term experience with these catheters for peritoneal dialysis. Regardless of type, overall catheter survival is approximately 88 percent at one year, with removal rates of 15 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2982929\"><span class=\"h2\">Choosing a catheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Commercially available peritoneal dialysis catheters vary by the design of their intra-abdominal segment (straight versus coiled), subcutaneous configuration (straight versus swan neck), number of cuffs (single versus double), tip (weighted versus not weighted), as well as the material from which they are manufactured (silicone versus polyurethane). The catheter used by a peritoneal dialysis program primarily depends upon the preference and experience of the clinicians inserting the catheter. We prefer to use the double-cuff straight (unweighted) Tenckhoff catheter. This preference is consistent with the International Society of Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) 2016 guidelines, which stated that no particular catheter is definitively better than the standard silicone Tenckhoff catheter for the prevention of peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A survey of US and Canadian nephrologists through the ISPD North American Research Consortium found nearly universal use of double-cuff catheters with near even distribution between pre-formed bend and straight cuff segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intra-abdominal segment </strong>&ndash; A 2014 meta-analysis of all available trials concluded that catheters with straight intra-abdominal segments were significantly more likely to remain functional at two years as compared with catheters with coiled intra-abdominal segments (79 versus 55 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The cause of the improved survival was unclear since mechanical and infectious complications were similar with both types of catheters. However, one trial in the meta-analysis found that the rate of technique failure was faster with coiled catheters (1.4 versus 2.1 years), principally due to inadequate small-solute clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, another trial showed a higher rate of late catheter tip migration with coiled catheters compared with straight catheters (32 versus 5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. One or both of these factors may have negatively impacted survival of the coiled catheters.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cuff </strong>&ndash; The midportion of a peritoneal dialysis catheter is normally implanted within the abdominal wall via one or two Dacron velour cuffs. The superficial cuff is always placed subcutaneously in the abdominal wall approximately 2 cm from the catheter exit site, while the deep cuff of a double-cuffed catheter is imbedded in the rectus abdominis muscle. We prefer to use double-cuff catheters over single-cuff catheters. Double-cuff catheters have the advantages of fewer complications, a longer time before first peritonitis episode, and longer survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/3,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12-14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Weighted tip </strong>&ndash; A catheter design in which the tip is weighted with 12 grams of tungsten (ie, self-locating catheter) may reduce the incidence of catheter migration and other complications by keeping the catheter tip firmly in the pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In one trial, 78 patients undergoing chronic peritoneal dialysis were randomly assigned to have either a self-locating catheter or a standard straight single-cuff Tenckhoff catheter inserted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Although the median catheter survival was not different, the self-locating catheter had significantly fewer malfunctions. Other observational studies also showed self-locating catheters to have lower rates of migration, flow problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], transfer to hemodialysis, peritonitis, exit-site infections, cuff extrusions, obstruction, and leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] compared with conventional catheters.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Subcutaneous segment </strong>&ndash; In the 2014 meta-analysis mentioned above, catheters with a straight or bent (swan neck) subcutaneous segment had similar rates of exit-site infection, peritonitis, migration, leakage, removal, and dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, one- and two-year survival rates were not significantly different between the two types of catheters.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, some authorities prefer to use different catheters for men and women. In an anthropometric analysis of 200 patients, swan neck catheters with a downwardly directed external limb and exit site were felt to be better suited for women, while Tenckhoff catheters with straight inter-cuff segments and a laterally directed tunnel and exit site were thought to be better suited for men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This gender difference primarily resulted from the fact that women favored the belt line above their umbilicus while men preferred it below the umbilicus. Preoperative assessment of patient body habitus also helps to identify those who require an extended catheter system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Presternal catheter'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2289807\"><span class=\"h2\">Placing a catheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various factors require consideration when inserting a peritoneal dialysis catheter. These include the location of the exit site, size of the exit site, use of prophylactic antibiotics, implantation technique, postoperative care of the catheter, and temporal needs for dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2289835\"><span class=\"h3\">Exit-site location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that peritoneal dialysis catheters with an abdominal exit be placed in a paramedian or lateral abdominal location rather than in the midline. This location allows for positioning of the catheter's deep cuff in or below the rectus muscle, thereby permitting better tissue ingrowth around the cuff given the rich vascularization of muscle. A paramedian location also provides better structural support for and a strong seal around the catheter, thereby minimizing the risk of peritoneal leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. However, the incidence of peritonitis or <span class=\"nowrap\">exit-site/tunnel</span> infections appeared to be similar with midline or lateral catheter insertions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2289841\"><span class=\"h3\">Exit-site size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that the catheter exit site should permit passage of only the tubing and consist of the smallest possible hole that leaves the skin snug around the catheter. Larger exit-site wounds created during peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion have been associated with increased infectious complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>For cuffed catheters, fibroblast ingrowth of the Dacron cuff is sufficient to anchor the catheter, obviating the need for suture material at the exit site. Sutures may act as a nidus for bacterial growth and increase the risk of catheter-related infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2289847\"><span class=\"h3\">Prophylactic antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We administer prophylactic antibiotics immediately prior to peritoneal catheter placement. This is consistent with the 2017 ISPD guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The administration of an antibiotic prior to peritoneal catheter placement decreases the incidence of wound infection and peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/24-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-29</a>]. A 2004 meta-analysis of four randomized trials including 335 patients found that the use of perioperative intravenous antibiotics, compared with no treatment, significantly reduced the risk of peritonitis within one month of surgery (5 versus 16 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Various guidelines over the years have recommended the use of either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] or a first-generation cephalosporin such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/13,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,31,32</a>] prior to peritoneal dialysis catheter placement. Given the emergence of vancomycin-resistant organisms, we prefer to administer a cephalosporin before placement of peritoneal dialysis catheters in most patients. There is center-to-center variation in the choice of preoperative antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The 2017 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and ISPD guidelines recommend screening patients for <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> nasal carriage and treatment with intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mupirocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mupirocin</a> if positive prior to peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, since compliance with this strategy may be difficult and because routine exit-site care usually includes the application of either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> or mupirocin cream (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-catheter-exit-site-and-tunnel-infections-in-peritoneal-dialysis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peritoneal catheter exit-site and tunnel infections in peritoneal dialysis in adults&quot;</a>), we do not screen for or treat <em>S. aureus</em> nasal carriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/23,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4342531\"><span class=\"h3\">Pre-placement laxatives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative constipation may lead to straining, which predisposes to early catheter leaks. Thus, some authorities prescribe laxatives preoperatively (ie, three and two nights prior to surgery but not the night before), whereas others who use laxatives give them only in the postoperative period. However, because the catheter is typically not used until two to three weeks after surgery, some experts do not give preoperative or postoperative laxatives.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2289984\"><span class=\"h3\">Insertion techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with the choice of catheter, the insertion techniques used by a peritoneal dialysis program depend upon local expertise. Non-temporary, cuffed peritoneal dialysis catheters can be inserted by surgeons via laparoscopy or laparotomy or by interventional radiologists or nephrologists under fluoroscopic guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/1-3,8,21,34-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,8,21,34-40</a>]. In resource-rich settings, laparoscopic or fluoroscopic procedures are most common; open surgical placement of peritoneal dialysis catheters is performed primarily in resource-limited settings.</p><p>In a survey of 51 North American peritoneal dialysis programs, 83 percent employ more than one insertion techniques, including 71 percent using laparoscopic techniques, 62 percent open surgical dissection, 29 percent blind insertion via Seldinger technique, and 10 percent blind insertion via trocar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Regardless of the insertion technique, however, creating a downwardly directed tunnel is preferred and recommended by international guidelines since it is associated with fewer catheter-related infectious complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/13,14,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,41</a>]. After laparoscopic or open surgical placement, catheter patency should always be assured before leaving the operating room by infusing 1 liter of peritoneal dialysate or saline over five minutes and allowing an additional five minutes for drainage or by instilling and aspirating saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2289990\"><span class=\"h4\">Laparoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopic catheter placement is a relatively simple and quick procedure in experienced hands and permits immediate use of the catheter after placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/3,21,35,38,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,21,35,38,42,43</a>]. A 2013 meta-analysis of three randomized trials and eight cohort studies found laparoscopic catheter placement superior to open surgical catheter placement. The laparoscopic technique resulted in a significantly lower risk of catheter migration (3 versus 18 percent) and better one-year catheter survival (94 versus 75 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2289996\"><span class=\"h4\">Open surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open surgical placement of the peritoneal dialysis catheter has the advantage of precise catheter placement with little risk of viscus perforation. Disadvantages include longer wait time before placement (due to the need for operating room scheduling), greater cost, and larger incisions required.</p><p>A modified technique used in open surgery called the buried catheter (ie, Moncrief-Popovich) technique keeps the entire catheter buried subcutaneously until it is ready to be used, usually four to six weeks after initial catheter placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This technique is rarely used because it is not associated with any lower incidences of peritonitis or exit-site infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>] but can cause primary catheter failure with prolonged catheter embedment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2290002\"><span class=\"h4\">Fluoroscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous fluoroscopy-guided catheter placement by interventional radiologists or nephrologists is timely, accurate, minimally invasive, and can be performed without general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Limited data suggest that this approach provides similar outcomes compared with more invasive techniques. In one study of 114 patients, 80, 75, and 71 percent of catheters placed fluoroscopically were still functional after one, two, and five years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, percutaneous placement of the peritoneal dialysis catheter is associated with a relatively high late leak rate (10 percent); late leak is the leading cause of catheter removal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESTERNAL CATHETER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Catheters that have an abdominal exit site are not suitable in some patients who require peritoneal dialysis (25 percent in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In those patients, the use of an extended catheter system provides a remote exit-site location in the upper abdomen or chest (eg, the presternal catheter) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58863\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58863 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/34,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2290014\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary reasons for relocating the catheter exit site away from the lower abdominal area include abdominal obesity and high risk of catheter contamination by urine or feces. Specific indications for using an extended catheter system include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Morbid obesity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Floppy abdominal skin folds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of a stoma (colostomy, ileostomy, or urostomy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incontinence of urine or feces</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very young children who wear diapers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with history of recurrent abdominal catheter infections</p><p/><p>Presternal catheters can be placed surgically or percutaneously, depending on local expertise (see <a href=\"#H2289984\" class=\"local\">'Insertion techniques'</a> above). Regardless of insertion technique, exit-site location of a presternal catheter should be at least 3 cm off the midline, and the catheter tubing should not cross the midline of the chest in case cardiac surgery is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Outcomes with presternal catheters are comparable with those with abdominal catheters. In one observational study of 115 patients, the use of a presternal catheter was associated with improved two-year catheter survival (95 versus 75 percent) and lower peritonitis rates (one episode per 37 versus 21 patient-months) compared with abdominal catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. These differences were not statistically significant, possibly due to small sample sizes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">POST-PLACEMENT CATHETER CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newly placed catheters are usually flushed with small volumes of dialysate until the effluent is clear. Five hundred to 1000 units of heparin may be added to each liter of dialysate if fibrin or clots are evident. The catheter is then capped and a dressing applied to the site. Peritoneal dialysis programs vary in their protocols for flushing new catheters. Most will not disturb the dressing or flush the catheter until a week after placement. It is common for the peritoneal dialysis nurse to change the dressing and flush the catheter weekly until peritoneal dialysis training is started.</p><p>There are few studies of optimal catheter care post-placement, but most programs suggest that the catheter site be covered with gauze dressing and remain undisturbed for several days to minimize trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Local trauma can increase the risk of bacterial colonization with subsequent infection. Infrequent dressing changes (eg, once per week) are probably sufficient for the first one to two weeks after implantation. To minimize the risk of fluid leak, it is preferable to wait at least 10 to 14 days after catheter insertion before beginning peritoneal dialysis unless urgent-start peritoneal dialysis is to be performed. Study groups may facilitate the development of best practice guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/8,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,50</a>].</p><p>In emergency situations, peritoneal dialysis can be initiated shortly after catheter placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/4,29,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,29,51,52</a>]. The practice of urgent-start peritoneal dialysis is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When peritoneal dialysis is temporarily discontinued, some programs choose to &quot;lock&quot; the peritoneal dialysis catheter with heparin to avoid clotting of the catheter. Heparin can be used for this purpose in the same doses used to lock hemodialysis catheters as the heparin is not peritoneally absorbed. Other programs do not lock the catheter with heparin, as the risk of catheter occlusion during non-use is probably low.</p><p>Optimal care of the peritoneal dialysis catheter exit site is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-catheter-exit-site-and-tunnel-infections-in-peritoneal-dialysis-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peritoneal catheter exit-site and tunnel infections in peritoneal dialysis in adults&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2287837\"><span class=\"h1\">TEMPORARY CATHETER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Temporary peritoneal dialysis catheters can be placed at bedside over a guidewire using a trocar. The procedure is quick and inexpensive, requires only a small incision, and permits immediate use of the catheter. However, catheters placed at bedside are prone to leaks and poor catheter flow. Because it is a blind procedure, bedside catheter placement may also result in a greater risk of inadvertent organ <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vessel injury than other methods.</p><p>Bedside catheter placement is only used to initiate temporary acute peritoneal dialysis in patients with acute kidney injury who are expected to recover quickly and when other methods of catheter placement are not available. Temporary catheters are <strong>not</strong> recommended for prolonged peritoneal dialysis. The risks associated with bedside catheter placement generally <strong>outweigh</strong> the benefits in most patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &quot;patient info&quot; and the keyword(s) of interest.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beyond the Basics topic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Peritoneal dialysis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9894345\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many types of catheters are available for peritoneal dialysis. The catheter used by a peritoneal dialysis program primarily depends upon the preferences and experience of the clinician inserting the catheters. For abdominal placement, we suggest the use of a double-cuffed, straight-tipped catheter, with a straight subcutaneous segment (eg, Tenckhoff catheter) rather than another type of catheter (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2982929\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a catheter'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that abdominal peritoneal dialysis catheters be placed in a paramedian or lateral abdominal location, rather than at the midline (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>), with the smallest exit wound possible to accommodate just the catheter. (See <a href=\"#H2289807\" class=\"local\">'Placing a catheter'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients undergoing placement of a peritoneal dialysis catheter, we recommend administration of preoperative antibiotics prior rather than no antibiotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2289847\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritoneal dialysis catheters can be placed surgically (laparoscopic or open surgical) or percutaneously with fluoroscopic guidance, depending upon local expertise. (See <a href=\"#H2289984\" class=\"local\">'Insertion techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are at high risk of abdominal catheter infection (eg, obese, excessive skin folds, with stoma or incontinence, infant), we suggest the use of an extended system (ie, presternal catheter) to allow for chest exit of the catheter, rather than the standard abdominal catheter (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Presternal catheter'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After insertion of a peritoneal dialysis catheter, we suggest that the catheter site be covered with gauze and undisturbed for several days rather than frequent dressing changes (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We suggest waiting for at least 10 to 14 days after catheter insertion before beginning peritoneal dialysis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In emergency situations, earlier initiation of peritoneal dialysis is possible with an established urgent-start peritoneal dialysis program. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Post-placement catheter care'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Cruz C.
