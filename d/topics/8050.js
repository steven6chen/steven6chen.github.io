Hemarthrosis may be suspected on the basis of a suggestive history, physical examination, or imaging studies, but definitive diagnosis usually requires joint aspiration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-monoarthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of monoarthritis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint aspiration or injection in adults: Technique and indications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-children-indications-technique-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint aspiration or injection in children: Indications, technique, and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">JOINT ASPIRATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Synovial fluid obtained from a patient with a hemarthrosis may appear red, pink, or brown. Other abnormalities of the fluid may be noted that depend upon the cause of the bleeding. As an example, the presence of lipid globules strongly suggests an intraarticular fracture, resulting in leakage of marrow fat into the synovial fluid. A true bloody effusion usually fails to clot due to chronic fibrinolysis, while blood from a traumatic aspiration generally does coagulate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>If the aspiration is not bloody initially, but fresh blood appears after some synovial fluid has been withdrawn, the most likely cause is a traumatic arthrocentesis. In this case, centrifugation of the specimen to examine the appearance of the resultant supernatant is useful. A serous appearance of the synovial fluid supernatant suggests that fresh blood has been admixed with previously nonbloody fluid. The aspirate from a patient with hemarthrosis will generally exhibit xanthochromia from lysis of the resident erythrocytes.</p><p>Although diagnosis of hemarthrosis usually requires joint aspiration, arthrocentesis is generally not required for diagnosis when the underlying cause is known with confidence (eg, patients with hemophilia and a history of hemarthrosis), and when important alternate diagnoses such as septic arthritis can be excluded clinically.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF HEMARTHROSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Broad categories of disorders that may result in hemarthrosis include trauma, bleeding disorders, neurologic deficits, arthritis, neoplasms, vascular damage, and other miscellaneous causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F80811\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80811 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Traumatic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injuries are among the most common causes of hemarthrosis. In patients with normal sensation, and without a bleeding diathesis, the joint trauma is generally remembered. The pain is often severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, pain may be minimal or absent immediately following the event. Patients with impaired sensation from neuropathy or myelopathy may have little or no pain despite the presence of a fracture.</p><p>Following a major injury with intraarticular bleeding, synovial fluid rapidly accumulates. The accumulation of bloody fluid is due to soft tissue injury or to bone or osteochondral fracture. Serious ligamentous, osseous, or cartilage damage may be suspected when joint swelling occurs within 12 hours after trauma, though swelling is present within two hours in many cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Knee injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The knee is a frequent site of injury, and evaluation for internal derangement is an important part of the evaluation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unspecified knee pain&quot;</a>). The most common mechanism of injury in patients with acute hemarthrosis of the knee is forced twisting of the loaded joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>The majority of cases of posttraumatic hemarthrosis of the knee are associated with ligamentous and meniscal damage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F65058\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65058 \">table 2</a>). Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are most common, occurring in approximately 70 percent of patients with posttraumatic hemarthrosis of the knee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Meniscal tears occur in 10 percent of patients, one-half of whom also have an ACL tear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patellar subluxation or dislocation occurs in 10 to 15 percent of patients, and osteochondral fracture fragments are found in 2 to 5 percent. Other lesions, such as posterior cruciate ligament injuries and capsule tears, occur in about 5 percent.</p><p>Tenderness to palpation of the medial or lateral joint lines or the patella can indicate the site of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Clinical tests for stability are performed with varus (for the lateral collateral ligament), valgus (for the medial collateral ligament), anterior (drawer test, for the anterior cruciate ligament), and posterior stress (posterior draw or sag test, for the posterior cruciate ligament) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89745%7EPC%2F73257\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89745 graphicRef73257 \">picture 1A-B</a>).</p><p>The initial imaging technique of choice is plain film radiography of the involved joint and adjacent bones. For the knee, anterior-posterior, lateral, patellar, and tunnel views are recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. If a fracture is strongly suspected but radiographs are negative, computed tomography (CT) may aid in diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides helpful information about ligamentous and cartilaginous structures that are not typically visible with plain radiographs or CT.</p><p>Arthroscopic evaluation of the knee provides an alternative approach to assessing the severity of knee damage when injury is accompanied by hemarthrosis. In a prospective study, all injured knees that had a traumatic hemarthrosis with little or no instability on clinical examination underwent arthroscopy and examination under anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. One-third of the knees had slight or no pain at the time of the injury. Some degree of disruption of the ACL of the involved knee was found in 71 percent of the patients examined, while a torn meniscus was present in 47 percent. A meniscal tear was frequently associated with injuries of varying severity to other joint structures.</p><p>Other damage found during arthroscopy and examination under anesthesia included minor ligament sprains without laxity, major associated ligament injury, and femoral cartilage fractures or surface defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. When examined without anesthesia, some patients with documented ACL tears did not have a positive drawer sign.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Lipohemarthrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lipohemarthrosis is the presence of fat and blood in a joint cavity. It is usually caused by intracapsular fractures or extensive intraarticular soft tissue injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Lipohemarthrosis can be detected during arthrocentesis, by CT scan or MRI, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> plain radiology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F88737\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef88737 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. While a single fluid-fluid level on cross-table plain radiographs is suggestive of lipohemarthrosis, this finding may occur due to separation of intraarticular cellular and fluid components following intraarticular bleeding without the presence of fat in joint fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The finding of a double fluid-fluid level is more specific for lipohemarthrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The diagnosis can be confirmed by ultrasonography in a minority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Minimal injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If hemarthrosis occurs after minimal trauma, coagulation disorders, such as hemophilia, an acquired inhibitor to factor VIII, or other disorder of blood clotting should be suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with a bleeding diathesis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a>). When hemarthrosis following minimal trauma is not due to a bleeding diathesis, the most commonly documented injuries are ACL and meniscal tears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Postoperative</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent postoperative hemarthrosis has been described in patients following total knee arthroplasty and has been attributed to the development of intracapsular vascular tissue subsequent to joint replacement. In addition, hemarthrosis has occurred after lateral releases and after arthroscopy. This is considered an unusual complication of such surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Nontraumatic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of hereditary, acquired, and iatrogenic bleeding disorders can result in hemarthrosis. Other potential causes are neurologic, infectious, and vascular diseases, arthritis, particularly osteoarthritis with associated chondrocalcinosis, and neoplasms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Bleeding disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding disorders should be considered when hemarthrosis occurs with minimal or no recollected trauma. Questions about bleeding during or after surgical or dental procedures, use of anticoagulant medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>] or rarely thrombolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>], and diet may help uncover the presence of a bleeding diathesis or its cause. Initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79969 \">table 3</a>). A bleeding time may be helpful if the history or physical examination suggests a platelet disorder; however, joint bleeding is typically seen with deficiencies in coagulation factors, rather than platelets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77834 \">table 4</a>). Unexplained abnormalities of any of these tests require further investigation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with a bleeding diathesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemophilic arthropathy &mdash; Hemarthrosis is the most common musculoskeletal manifestation of hemophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Severe hemophilia (defined as less than 1 percent of normal factor activity) causes hemarthrosis in 75 to 90 percent of patients. The first attack usually occurs between two or three years of age. The knee is the most common joint involved, followed by the elbow, ankle, hip, and shoulder. Bleeding commonly recurs in a subset of joints, referred to as &ldquo;target joints,&rdquo; that are at highest risk for permanent injury. Bilateral involvement is not uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hemophilia&quot;, section on 'Hemophilic arthropathy'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Three forms of hemarthrosis are recognized: acute, subacute, and chronic.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In acute hemarthrosis, the affected joint is painful, swollen, and warm, and range of motion is reduced. The clinical manifestations vary by age. In infants, early signs of bleeding include irritability and decreased use of the affected limb. In older children and adults, hemarthrosis is manifested by prodromal stiffness and, in some patients, by a characteristic warm sensation, which is followed by acute pain and swelling. One joint is usually affected at a time, but multiple bleeding sites are not uncommon. Symptoms respond rapidly to plasma and factor replacement, and as the effusion is reabsorbed, mobility returns.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Untreated hemorrhage can lead to intraarticular damage in the subacute stage. In this stage, toxic effects of blood products lead to synovial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and impaired joint movement. Despite marked internal derangement, joint pain is not prominent at this time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeated attacks or persistent hemorrhage for more than six months leads to chronic disabling arthropathy, with symptoms sometimes mimicking osteoarthritis. Chronic arthropathy can affect 20 percent or more of patients with hemophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p>The histopathology of hemophilic arthropathy is complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In early disease, the histology reveals synovial hypertrophy and fibrosis, changes similar to rheumatoid arthritis. Late disease is characterized by disruption of cartilage and by subchondral bone cyst formation. Cyst formation appears to reflect the combined effects of degeneration and interosseous bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Cartilage and bone destruction in affected patients appears to be the result of direct toxic effects of blood products, mechanical effects, and cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Iron, in the form of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric citrate</a>, stimulates human fibroblast like synovial cells to proliferate in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In vitro data suggest that blood can be toxic to human cartilage after as little as two days, though whether this is also true of the living joint is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Murine studies suggest that blood vessel hyperplasia occurs in reaction to hemarthrosis, potentially predisposing to recurrent bleeding (&ldquo;target joints&rdquo;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Growing cartilage is most susceptible to blood-induced damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Thus, children should be treated aggressively to minimize joint injury.</p><p>Treatment of hemarthrosis in the setting of hemophilia is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of bleeding and perioperative management in hemophilia A and B&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Radiologically, five stages of hemophilic arthropathy are recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 1: Soft tissue swelling &ndash; This is characterized by swelling secondary to direct bleeding, both into the joint and into the adjacent tissues.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 2: Osteoporosis &ndash; The second stage is characterized by the development of osteoporosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> epithelial overgrowth secondary to inflammatory hyperemia, especially marked in the knee and elbow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 3: Osseous lesions &ndash; The third stage is characterized by disorganization of the joint with overgrowth of the epiphysis, squaring of the patella, and widening of the articular notch of the knee and the trochlea of the ulna; the articular cartilage remains intact.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 4: Cartilage destruction &ndash; The fourth stage is characterized by destruction and secondary joint space narrowing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 5: Joint disorganization &ndash; The fifth stage is due to chronic disease that leads to complete loss of cartilage spaces, and considerable bony erosion and irregularity.</p><p/><p>Radiographic assessment of hemophilic arthropathy tends to underestimate the joint destruction.

Peripheral arterial aneurysms may rupture, resulting in intraarticular hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The neoplasms most often associated with hemarthrosis are generally benign. Two important types are synovial hemangiomas and pigmented villonodular synovitis. Malignant tumors, both metastatic and those arising de novo in or near a joint, can lead to bloody effusions.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Synovial hemangioma &ndash; A synovial hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that can occur in a joint, usually the knee. Children are more likely to have intraarticular hemangiomas than adults. Affected patients present with a recurrent painful monoarticular hemarthrosis, usually affecting the knee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Recurrent swelling due to hemarthrosis and intermittent pain can be present long before the diagnosis is made.<br/><br/>Synovial hemangiomas may be congenital, appearing as solitary neoplasms that infiltrate local tissue and adjacent neurologic structures. Whether congenital or not, the margins of the mass are typically composed of both large and small vessels. Despite their vascular origin, hemangiomas do not metastasize or undergo malignant transformation. Pathologic examination of hemangiomas shows spaces of various sizes, ranging from capillaries to cavernous sinusoids, which are lined by endothelium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tenosynovial giant cell <span class=\"nowrap\">tumor/Pigmented</span> villonodular synovitis &ndash; Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT), historically known as pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS), is a slow-growing, benign, but locally invasive tumor of the synovium. It most commonly involves the knee, but can also occur in the hip, ankle, and elbow. Episodic acute attacks of pain and swelling are associated with spontaneous hemarthrosis. Most patients with knee involvement have difficulty in ambulation, and may experience locking and catching of the joint. This tumor-like growth may be driven by overexpression of colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1; also known as macrophage-CSF [M-CSF]) by a minority of cells, driving recruitment and expansion of CSF1-responsive neighboring cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antineoplastic therapy for miscellaneous benign diseases affecting soft tissue and bone&quot;, section on 'Tenosynovial giant cell tumor'</a>.)<br/><br/>The synovial fluid classically is dark brown or hemorrhagic. A synovial biopsy may be diagnostic. The histopathology of TGCT can mimic rheumatoid arthritis, but TGCT affects few joints and rarely in a symmetrical fashion. It usually presents as a monoarticular hemarthrosis and it may exist in nodular or diffuse form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].<br/><br/>The diffuse form is characterized by a history of swelling that is not preceded by trauma. On physical examination, the majority of patients have distension of the suprapatellar pouch and a large effusion. As many as 40 percent may have a palpable diffuse synovial mass. This can be accompanied by periarticular erosions on plain radiographs; the disease may be active or inactive. The nodular form is less common and does not show the same destructive changes as the diffuse form. It can cause recurrent hemarthrosis, but the aspirate may be of normal color and not show the classic changes or radiographic findings.<br/><br/>The most common feature of TGCT on MRI is the presence of intraarticular nodules or masses. MRI findings are very useful in the diagnosis of TGCT, because hemosiderin in the tissues renders TGCT &quot;dark&quot; on all MRI sequences due to a characteristic lack of signal on both T1 and T2 images. Treatment with arthroscopic synovectomy may be indicated for the nodular form or for the inactive form of diffuse disease. Systemic administration of TNF antagonists was reportedly beneficial in one case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. CSF1 antagonism can be effective in some cases but must be balanced against potential toxicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antineoplastic therapy for miscellaneous benign diseases affecting soft tissue and bone&quot;, section on 'Tenosynovial giant cell tumor'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of hemarthrosis can be divided into interventions that are generally useful for any patient with an acute hemarthrosis and more specific treatment directed toward the underlying disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">General</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immobilization, particularly with acute posttraumatic hemarthrosis, ice, and compression are important first-aid measures. Potent analgesics may be required while the diagnostic evaluation proceeds. Aspiration itself may provide some relief of pain. While recurrent hemarthrosis, for example in the context of hemophilia, poses a high risk of joint injury, an isolated episode of bleeding into the joint is unlikely to cause lasting injury, and lavage is not indicated in such patients. Whether lavage avoids long-term consequences of recurrent hemarthrosis is uncertain, although good outcomes have been reported with prompt arthrocentesis, saline lavage, and corticosteroid instillation in patients with hemophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided until the results of tests of the coagulation cascade are completed. Use of the selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> has been found safe and effective in a small cohort of patients with hemophilic arthropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Since the selective COX-2 inhibitors do not interfere with platelet function and may be less likely to cause gastroduodenal damage than nonselective NSAIDs, this approach has some appeal for treating chronic joint pain in those with clotting factor deficiencies. However, until more data are available on the safety of selective COX-2 inhibitors, it is prudent to avoid their use in patients with known ischemic heart disease or those at high risk for myocardial infarction or stroke.

Complete immobilization of the involved joint is prudent until radiographs have been obtained. If there is evidence of a fracture or suspicion of an internal derangement, orthopedic consultation should be considered. Although not all intraarticular fractures require operative intervention, the patient and radiographic findings should be discussed with someone experienced in fracture care. Ligamentous and meniscal injuries do not generally require immediate operative intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Coagulopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with hemarthrosis after minor or no trauma are, as discussed previously, likely to have some type of bleeding disorder, most often hemophilia or administration of anticoagulation therapies. The prevention and treatment of acute and chronic hemarthrosis in patients with known clotting factor deficiency is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of bleeding and perioperative management in hemophilia A and B&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synovectomy for inflammatory arthritis of the knee&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinically important hemarthrosis in patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation is rare. Diagnostic or therapeutic arthrocentesis is usually well-tolerated in these patients despite the use of such therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In most patients, temporary immobilization and analgesics will be the only treatment necessary after correction, if needed, of excessive anticoagulation. In the unusual event of persistent or recurrent hemarthrosis, an anatomic cause should be sought [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemarthrosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. If the patient is not at immediate risk of thromboembolism, repletion of clotting factors with fresh frozen plasma could be considered.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synovectomy for inflammatory arthritis of the knee&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H167399909\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemarthrosis, bleeding into a joint from any of a variety of causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F80811\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80811 \">table 1</a>), results in monarticular pain and swelling. Diagnosis usually requires joint aspiration, which reveals red, pink, or brown synovial fluid; arthrocentesis is generally not required for diagnosis when the underlying cause is known with confidence (eg, patients with hemophilia and a history of hemarthrosis), and when important alternate diagnoses such as septic arthritis can be excluded clinically. Other abnormalities of the fluid depend upon the cause of the bleeding. A true bloody effusion usually fails to clot due to chronic fibrinolysis, while blood from a traumatic aspiration generally does coagulate. Traumatic arthrocentesis is most likely if the aspiration is not bloody initially, but fresh blood appears after some synovial fluid has been withdrawn. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Causes of hemarthrosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Joint aspiration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injuries are among the most common causes of hemarthrosis. The pain is often severe, but may be minimal or absent immediately following the event. Patients with impaired sensation from neuropathy or myelopathy may have little or no pain despite the presence of a fracture. The rapid accumulation of bloody fluid that follows a major injury with intraarticular bleeding is due to soft tissue injury or to bone or osteochondral fracture. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Traumatic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The knee is a frequent site of injury, and evaluation for internal derangement is an important part of the evaluation. The most common mechanism of injury in patients with acute hemarthrosis of the knee is forced twisting of the loaded joint. The initial imaging technique of choice is plain film radiography. If a fracture is strongly suspected but radiographs are negative, computed tomography (CT) may aid in diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging provides helpful information about ligamentous and cartilaginous structures. Arthroscopic evaluation of the knee may be helpful in some patients. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Knee injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional concerns in patients with traumatic hemarthrosis include lipohemarthrosis, recurrent postoperative hemarthrosis following total knee arthroplasty, and coagulation disorders, which should be suspected in patients in whom hemarthrosis occurs after minimal trauma. When hemarthrosis following minimal trauma is not due to a bleeding diathesis, the most commonly documented injuries are anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscal tears. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Lipohemarthrosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Minimal injuries'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of hereditary, acquired, and iatrogenic bleeding disorders can result in hemarthrosis. Bleeding disorders should be considered when hemarthrosis occurs with minimal or no recollected trauma. Hemarthrosis is typically seen with deficiencies in coagulation factors, rather than platelets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77834 \">table 4</a>). Three forms of hemarthrosis due to hemophilia and other coagulopathies are recognized: acute, subacute, and chronic; and five stages of hemophilic arthropathy have been identified. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential causes of hemarthrosis other than bleeding disorders include neurologic, infectious, and vascular diseases; arthritis, particularly osteoarthritis with associated chondrocalcinosis; and neoplasms, including tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT; formerly termed pigmented villonodular synovitis [PVNS]). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Nontraumatic'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Osteoarthritis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic disorders'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Septic arthritis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Vascular disorders'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Tumors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of hemarthrosis can be divided into interventions that are generally useful for any patient with an acute hemarthrosis and more specific treatment directed toward the underlying disorder. Treatments of general benefit include immobilization, ice, and compression initially; analgesia; and arthrocentesis. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that interfere with platelet function should be avoided. Lavage and corticosteroid instillation should be considered for recurrent hemarthrosis associated with hemophilia. Specific treatment can be employed when a definite cause for the hemarthrosis can be identified. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'General'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Specific'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'After major trauma'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Aneurysms'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Benign tumors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to patients treated with anticoagulation is variable, depending upon the risk of reduced anticoagulation therapy. The treatment of patients with known clotting factor deficiency is described in detail separately.
