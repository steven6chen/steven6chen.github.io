It is the leading cause of nonhereditary sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and can cause other long-term neurodevelopmental disabilities, including cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, vision impairment, and seizures. At birth, most infants with congenital CMV are asymptomatic, but approximately 10 percent have symptoms.</p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of congenital CMV infection will be reviewed below. The management and outcome of congenital CMV infection, other TORCH infections, CMV in pregnancy, and CMV infections in older infants and children are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-management-and-outcome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cytomegalovirus infection: Management and outcome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-torch-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of TORCH infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cytomegalovirus infection in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cytomegalovirus infections in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H134244\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants with congenital CMV infection are classified according to the presence or absence of apparent symptoms at the time of birth.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term &quot;<strong>symptomatic</strong>&quot; refers to<strong> </strong>infants with one or more symptoms at birth. (See <a href=\"#H582408938\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic neonate'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term &quot;<strong>asymptomatic</strong>&quot; refers to infants with no apparent symptoms at birth, although some of these infants may develop hearing loss or subtle symptoms later in life. (See <a href=\"#H582411515\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic infection'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term &quot;<strong>asymptomatic with failed hearing screen</strong>&quot; refers to infants with isolated hearing loss at birth but no other symptoms. In studies of congenital CMV infection after the advent of universal newborn hearing screening, categorization of these infants as &quot;symptomatic&quot; or &quot;asymptomatic&quot; is inconsistent. Historically, they were often classified as &quot;asymptomatic&quot; because the hearing loss may not have been detected at birth. However, with universal newborn hearing screening, many such infants come to medical attention in the newborn period. We consider these infants to represent a distinct category because they are not truly asymptomatic, but their disease is generally milder than that of symptomatic infants.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9542605\"><span class=\"h1\">VIROLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a member of the herpesvirus family, along with Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex viruses-1 and -2, varicella-zoster virus, and human herpesviruses (HHV)-6, -7, and -8. These viruses share structural properties, including a genome of double-stranded linear DNA, a virus capsid of icosahedral symmetry, and a viral envelope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Like other herpesviruses, CMV has the biological properties of latency and reactivation. With latent CMV infection, a low level of virus replication is detectable and the viral genome may be present in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bone marrow. Recurrent infections with CMV occur through reactivation of the host's endogenous strain of CMV or reinfection with a new exogenous strain. CMV strains may compartmentalize such that the strain in the urine, for example, may be different from that in the blood, eye, or central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>CMV replicates slowly, often taking as long as 24 hours to produce progeny in infected cells and several days to weeks to produce a visible cytopathic effect in laboratory cell lines. Clinical samples with high titer of virus, such as urine or saliva samples from congenitally infected newborns, have multiple foci of cytopathic effect visible within a few days of incubation, whereas clinical samples with low titer of virus may require one to three weeks of incubation to show classic focal cytopathic effect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81737\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81737 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9542611\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection occurs worldwide, with a prevalence of 0.6 percent in developed countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Approximately 40,000 infants are born with congenital CMV infection annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The rate of congenital CMV infection, but not necessarily congenital CMV disease, is proportional to the seroprevalence of CMV in women of childbearing years. In areas of high CMV seroprevalence (80 to 100 percent), congenital CMV infection rates range from 1 to 5 percent, whereas in areas of relatively low CMV seroprevalence (40 to 70 percent). congenital CMV infection rates range from 0.4 to 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2,4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4-7</a>].</p><p>Maternal CMV infection during pregnancy most often results from close contact with young children, particularly children attending daycare centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The risk of vertical transmission to the fetus is far higher with primary maternal infection than with recurrent infection (32 versus 1.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The rate of fetal transmission appears to increase with advancing gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Other factors that can influence transmission of CMV infection during pregnancy include maternal age and parity (increased risk in younger primigravid women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy#H3744888726\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cytomegalovirus infection in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Seroprevalence'</a>.)</p><p>Infants infected as a result of a primary maternal infection are more likely to have symptoms at birth and suffer long-term sequelae than those infected as a result of maternal recurrent CMV infection. The risk of hearing loss, however, appears to be similar in both groups. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11,12</a>].</p><p>Sequelae appear to be more severe when infection is acquired earlier in pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester. However, symptomatic congenital CMV infection may result from maternal infection at any time during pregnancy. In a study of 238 women with primary CMV infection during pregnancy, symptomatic infection of the fetus occurred in 14 percent (10 of 72) of cases when maternal infection occurred in the first trimester compared with no cases (0 of 54) when infection occurred later in pregnancy, although the rate of viral transmission was higher later in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9542619\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H582407169\"><span class=\"h2\">In utero</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fetus may be silently infected or manifest congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in utero.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-management-and-outcome#H22557906\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cytomegalovirus infection: Management and outcome&quot;, section on 'Antiviral treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-management-and-outcome#H86567155\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cytomegalovirus infection: Management and outcome&quot;, section on 'Long-term follow-up'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15657556\"><span class=\"h2\">Targeted newborn screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Targeted newborn screening (also referred to as targeted diagnostic testing) involves testing for CMV in all newborns who fail their newborn hearing screen (see <a href=\"#H15657216\" class=\"local\">'Whom to test'</a> above). Many hospitals have adopted targeted CMV screening programs that aim to identify infected infants in the newborn period so that appropriate treatment may be provided. In a study conducted at seven centers in the United States, nearly 100,000 neonates underwent both newborn hearing screening and screening for CMV, with additional testing and follow-up for infants with abnormal screening results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Congenital CMV infection was identified in 443 infants (0.4 percent), of whom 35 (8 percent) were found to have CMV-related sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). The newborn hearing screen identified 20 of these infants, whereas the remaining 15 passed the initial hearing screen and later had SNHL confirmed by a diagnostic hearing evaluation in the first 3 to 8 weeks of life.</p><p>In some regions, legislation has been passed supporting targeted testing for congenital CMV and providing information on CMV treatment and management to families of these newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In a study that examined data collected after implementing such a public health effort in Utah, the rate of detection of congenital CMV infection among neonates who failed newborn hearing screen was six percent (14 of 234) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. However, only 62 percent of eligible infants (ie, those who never passed hearing screening) underwent CMV screening.</p><p>Targeted screening is not sufficient to detect all infants with congenital CMV who would benefit from treatment or monitoring. Therefore, some experts recommend universal newborn screening for congenital CMV as discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15657657\"><span class=\"h2\">Universal newborn screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Universal newborn screening for congenital CMV has been proposed by many CMV experts, audiologists, otolaryngologists, and public health officials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/59,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,64,65</a>]. The main goal of this approach is to identify asymptomatic infected infants in order to provide careful monitoring for delayed-onset hearing loss. Asymptomatic newborns with congenital CMV infection have a risk of delayed-onset hearing loss that is not detected by newborn hearing screen protocols. Antiviral treatment is generally not recommended for infected infants who pass the newborn hearing screen and are otherwise asymptomatic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-management-and-outcome#H133921\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cytomegalovirus infection: Management and outcome&quot;, section on 'Whom to treat'</a>). However, if delayed-onset hearing loss is identified, educational accommodations, <span class=\"nowrap\">speech/language</span> therapies, and other appropriate interventions can be initiated at an early stage in order to optimize the child's language development and learning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hearing-loss-in-children-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hearing loss in children: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Universal newborn screening appears to be cost effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. However, testing for congenital CMV infection is not yet included on the national Routine Universal Screening Panel. The most reliable and cost effective method for universal newborn screening for congenital CMV is not established. It may involve detection of CMV in saliva or urine collected at birth and tested by central laboratory high throughput technology or by simple point-of-care detection methods that are under development; or testing of dried blood spots collected for routine newborn screening panels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/61,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,64</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Newborn screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the absence of universal screening, the diagnosis of congenital CMV is often delayed because many infected newborns do not exhibit classic signs and symptoms. Among newborns who fail newborn hearing screening, testing for CMV often is not performed until completion of confirmatory auditory testing and evaluation by otolaryngology specialists. In addition, as previously discussed, newborn hearing screening fails to detect newborns with asymptomatic congenital CMV and delayed-onset hearing loss. These newborns may only be detected if universal newborn screening for CMV is implemented.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103350\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection affects approximately 40,000 infants annually in the United States and is associated with long-term neurodevelopmental disabilities, including sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, vision impairment, and seizures. It is the leading cause of nonhereditary SNHL. (See <a href=\"#H9542597\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most infants with congenital CMV infection are asymptomatic, but approximately 10 percent of infected neonates have symptoms at birth.

Both viral culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests have high sensitivity and specificity for detection of CMV in infected neonates.

Appropriate virologic and microbiologic studies, chromosomal analysis, metabolic studies, drug screening, and the presence and pattern of calcifications on computed tomography (CT) imaging of the brain will aid in differentiating among these possibilities.
