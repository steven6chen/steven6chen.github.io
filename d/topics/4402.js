Nevertheless, complications during and after total knee replacement may occur. These include anesthesia-related risks, exacerbation of comorbid medical issues, medication and allergic reactions, and complications related more specifically to total knee arthroplasty.</p><p>Complications related to total knee arthroplasty, although uncommon, range from minor problems to devastating, life-threatening events. The incidence of some of these complications may potentially be reduced if the procedure is performed by a higher volume surgeon and hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Efforts should be made to minimize the risk of complications with appropriate patient selection and optimization, meticulous surgical technique, and attentive postoperative management. This topic discusses complications of total knee arthroplasty. The indications for, alternatives to, and surgical technique for total knee arthroplasty are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-knee-arthroplasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Total knee arthroplasty&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1421910395\"><span class=\"h1\">INTRAOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3632263867\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic injuries</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4144819348\"><span class=\"h3\">Peroneal nerve palsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common neurologic complication after total knee arthroplasty is peroneal nerve palsy. Clinical manifestations include paresthesia, numbness, and extensor weakness (drop foot). Patients with severe valgus alignment in combination with a flexion deformity are at greatest risk.</p><p>If noticed in the postoperative period, the surgical dressings are immediately loosened, and the knee is flexed to relieve pressure on the nerve. Nerve recovery is variable. As an example, one study found that 50 percent of episodes of peroneal palsy had a full recovery; patients with some residual nerve function recovered more often than those with complete palsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3041845172\"><span class=\"h3\">Tourniquet-related nerve injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tourniquet use, common in total knee arthroplasty, may be associated with nerve injury due to compression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ischemia. However, studies indicate nerve injury from tourniquet use is quite rare, especially when used at lower tourniquet pressures and for shorter time periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2385824829\"><span class=\"h2\">Arterial injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vascular injuries in total knee arthroplasty are exceedingly rare. One survey of 147 surgeons documented only 14 arterial complications, the majority of which were thromboses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2965367327\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Thromboembolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) with the potential to propagate a potentially lethal pulmonary embolus (PE) is the most feared complication of total knee arthroplasty. The reported incidence of DVT following total knee arthroplasty without prophylaxis ranges from 40 to 88 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The incidences of asymptomatic PE, symptomatic PE, and mortality range from 10 to 20 percent, from 0.5 to 3 percent, and up to 2 percent, respectively.</p><p>By contrast, the rates of inpatient venous thromboembolism (VTE) and PE among patients receiving prophylaxis following total or partial knee arthroplasty were much lower in estimates from a meta-analysis involving 23,475 patients in 26 randomized trials and observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Venous thromboembolic events, symptomatic DVT, and PE occurred in 1.09 percent (95% CI 0.85-1.33), 0.63 percent (95% CI 0.47-0.78), and 0.27 percent (95% CI 0.16-0.38), respectively.</p><p>The choice of prophylaxis should be dictated by a careful analysis of the risk of DVT and PE versus the risk of bleeding in any given individual. The prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of DVT and PE after total joint arthroplasty (hip and knee) are discussed separately.

The risk appears highest in patients 80 years or older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1133751294\"><span class=\"h2\">Aseptic loosening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loosening of the implant, which can occur early or late, has emerged as the most common mode of failure after total knee arthroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Aseptic failure of total knee replacements may occur through several mechanisms, including polyethylene wear-induced osteolysis and component loosening (which may be due to osteolysis, excessive stress on components, poor fixation, poor component design, and other reasons). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of total hip arthroplasty&quot;, section on 'Osteolysis and wear'</a>.)</p><p>Diagnosis is made by evidence of progressive radiolucency on serial radiographs. Bone scan may also play a role in the diagnosis. Most critical is ruling out the possibility of infection. Typically, aspiration of the joint for cell count, Gram stain, and cultures are performed. In addition, laboratory studies consisting of an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are obtained. Once infection is ruled out, the patient with symptomatic aseptic prosthetic failure may be a candidate for revision total knee arthroplasty.</p><p>It appears younger age (&lt;50 years) is associated with a higher rate of loosening, and, therefore, total knee replacement should be undertaken cautiously in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection is another serious complication of total knee arthroplasty. The incidence of infection following total knee arthroplasty is low. As an example, one large study of 4171 knee arthroplasties found an infection rate of 1.6 percent using prophylactic antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Patients with diabetes are at increased risk of both superficial and deep postoperative infection when compared with nondiabetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Other risk factors for infection include obesity, smoking, malnutrition, and inflammatory arthritis.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of infection following total knee arthroplasty are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prosthetic joint infection: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-prosthetic-joint-and-other-types-of-orthopedic-hardware-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of prosthetic joint and other types of orthopedic hardware infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prosthetic joint infection: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Patellofemoral disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patellofemoral complications, as a group, are a common reason for reoperation after total knee arthroplasty. Patellofemoral complications include patellar instability, loosening of the patellar component, patellar component failure, patella fracture, patella clunk syndrome, and rupture of the extensor mechanism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Patellofemoral instability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patellofemoral instability may manifest as subluxation or dislocation of the patella. Incidence varies between 1 and 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Diagnosis is made by standard radiographs including a tangential (eg, &quot;sunrise&quot; or Merchant) view of the patella. Occasionally, a computed tomography (CT) scan is obtained to determine component position (the femoral component requires several degrees of external rotation to have proper patellofemoral tracking). Treatment depends upon the problem and may include a surgical release of tight lateral soft tissues, patellofemoral realignment procedures, or revision of malpositioned components.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Patellar component loosening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loosening of the patellar component may be associated with osteolysis or with migration of the prosthesis and is often secondary to another condition. Among the associated disorders are instability, fracture, component malposition, osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, and poor cement technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Diagnosis is made with standard radiographs. Asymptomatic patients are observed, and symptomatic patients may undergo revision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Patellar component failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patellar component failure was typically associated with metal-backed patella components. This failure-prone design has, for the most part, been abandoned in favor of prosthetic patellar components made entirely of polyethylene.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Patella fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patella fracture had a reported incidence of 0.3 percent in one study of 2887 knees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Fracture may be related to prosthesis design and positioning, to surgical techniques, to avascular necrosis of the patella, to excessive knee flexion, or to trauma.</p><p>Diagnosis is with standard radiographs. A tangential view of the patella is recommended in addition to routine anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views in order to detect sagittal (vertical) fractures that could be inapparent on AP and lateral views.</p><p>Treatment depends upon the severity of the fracture, the status of patellar component (loose versus well-fixed), and the status of the extensor mechanism (ability to perform a straight leg raise indicates an intact extensor mechanism). Treatment may vary from nonoperative (well-fixed component, minimally displaced fracture, intact extensor mechanism) to open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture with or without component revision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Patella clunk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patella clunk syndrome, a clunk felt as the knee is actively extended from 60 to 30 degrees, results from formation of fibrous tissue on the quadriceps tendon. The syndrome was predominantly seen with early designs of posterior cruciate substituting prostheses. The incidence of patella clunk has decreased with changes in component design.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Extensor mechanism rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rupture of the extensor mechanism (quadriceps or patellar tendon) is a feared complication but, fortunately, is rare. The major manifestation is an inability to actively extend the knee. Surgery is the treatment of choice; however, poor outcomes are normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patellar tendon rupture is a rare complication of knee arthroplasty. Surgical repair with autologous, allogeneic, or prosthetic tendon grafts may be necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Physiotherapy with a goal of maintaining knee extension and, thus, of minimizing the risk of developing an irreversible knee flexion contracture is recommended while awaiting reoperation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Periprosthetic fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fractures may occur around the femoral component, the tibial component, or the patella (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Patella fracture'</a> above). Periprosthetic fractures occur more commonly in patients with osteoporosis (primary or secondary to glucocorticoids, disease, etc), with rheumatoid arthritis, and with stiff knees and may follow revision arthroplasty.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Femoral fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supracondylar femoral fractures may have an association with notching of the anterior femur at the time of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Minimally displaced, well-aligned fractures with well-fixed components are treated nonoperatively with casting or bracing. Displaced fractures are reduced and fixed with plates and screws or with intramedullary rods. If the component is loose, it is revised.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Tibial fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tibial fractures around a total knee are rare. Like supracondylar femoral fractures, these are also treated nonoperatively or operatively depending upon the degree of displacement, the alignment, and the status of the implant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Wound problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the thin, soft tissue envelope around the knee, wound healing problems may occur and require prompt recognition and management to avoid severe complications, including infection and possible loss of the implant. Preoperative planning and evaluation of risk factors (rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, obesity), especially in a knee with prior incisions, are critical. Persistent drainage should be treated by exclusion of infection with aspiration and cultures and by surgical irrigation and debridement. Plastic surgery consultation should be obtained, as needed, to ensure soft tissue coverage of the prosthesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Polyethylene wear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wear is a normal phenomenon due to friction between the femoral component and the polyethylene of the tibial and patellar components. However, accelerated wear may occur because of patient-dependent factors (eg, activity level, weight), surgical technique (especially postoperative mechanical alignment), and prosthetic design and quality control issues. Newer highly crosslinked polyethylenes have been utilized more commonly in total knee arthroplasty in an attempt to decrease wear rates. It is too early to tell if these new materials will decrease overall complication rates.</p><p>Patients with polyethylene wear may be asymptomatic or symptomatic, with pain, swelling, and increasing deformity in the knee. Diagnosis is made by plain radiographs, which may reveal joint space narrowing. Treatment may include continued observation, polyethylene liner exchange, or revision total knee arthroplasty if associated with component loosening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5141112\"><span class=\"h2\">Instability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Instability after knee replacement has been described as a significant factor which can lead to revision surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Instability can occur in flexion, extension, or both. Generally, patients will present with pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> persistent effusions. Revision total knee arthroplasty to a more constrained implant is often required, although bracing may be considered as an alternative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5141119\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent pain and dissatisfaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although outcomes after total knee replacement are generally good, many patients continue to report clinically significant pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dissatisfaction. In one series of 1703 primary total knee replacements, 19 percent of patients were dissatisfied with their outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Similarly, in a systematic review of high-quality prospective studies of patients with osteoarthritis undergoing total knee replacement, about 20 percent of patients reported moderate to severe knee pain following surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Efforts to identify the explanations for these suboptimal pain outcomes are an active area of research. Possible explanations for such persistent pain complaints include inappropriate expectations, technical failures of the procedure, pain from other sources, poor pain-coping skills, and others.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16754628\"><span class=\"h2\">Stiffness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stiffness, also called arthrofibrosis, is a postoperative limitation of range of motion that may result in functional impairment. Although there are no universally accepted criteria to diagnose stiffness, studies have shown that patients require the following amounts of knee flexion for different activities: 67 degrees to complete the<sup> </sup>swing phase of gait, 83 degrees to ascend stairs, 100 degrees<sup> </sup>to descend stairs, 93 degrees to rise from a standard chair, and<sup> </sup>up to 105 degrees to rise from a low chair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Stiffness may be caused by patient-related (preoperative) factors, technical (intraoperative) factors, and numerous postoperative factors (patient compliance with therapy, heterotopic bone, infection, pain syndromes). The best predictor of postoperative stiffness is preoperative range of motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Treatments include manipulation under anesthesia, arthroscopic lysis of adhesions, and revision knee replacement. Manipulation under anesthesia is safest and most effective if performed within the first three postoperative months. It remains controversial whether use of continuous passive motion may prevent stiffness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-knee-arthroplasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Total knee arthroplasty&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1381354707\"><span class=\"h2\">Metal sensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An emerging topic of debate in total knee arthroplasty is the influence of the implant materials on the outcome of total knee arthroplasty. Certain individuals appear to be hypersensitive to metals in the device, typically cobalt, chromium, or nickel. Symptoms can include persistent pain, effusions, or possibly cutaneous reactions. It is important to exclude more common forms of failure (loosening, infection, instability, etc) prior to making this diagnosis. Testing is controversial but includes skin patch testing and in vitro lymphocyte transformation testing. No evidence supports widespread testing at this time, but testing may be considered in patients with a history of metal sensitivity. There does seem to be some preliminary evidence of a linkage between metal sensitivity and implant failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H962858183\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
