The acute process is self-limited, rarely causes hepatic failure, and usually leads to chronic infection. Chronic HCV infection often follows a progressive course over many years and can ultimately result in cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the need for liver transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic addresses the general management of patients with chronic HCV infection.

Specifically, identification of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis informs the need for additional monitoring and management. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of viral and host factors that inform the optimal antiviral selection.

Counseling and screening for depression should be a major consideration, both at diagnosis and during subsequent follow-up. Many patients benefit from participation in a support group. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hepatitis C (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>HCV-infected individuals may also have issues with ongoing illicit drug use. Such patients should be counseled on substance use treatment, including psychiatric services or opioid substitution therapy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuing-care-for-addiction-implementation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuing care for addiction: Implementation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-opioid-use-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder&quot;</a>). Active injection drug use is not a contraindication to antiviral therapy, as long as the patient wishes to be treated and is willing and able to adhere to close monitoring during treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1708994273\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transmission of HCV is primarily through exposure to infected blood. Counseling should include discussions about the specific routes of HCV transmission and advice on measures to decrease the risk of transmission to other individuals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58787\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58787 \">table 1</a>). Women of childbearing age may also be concerned about the risk of perinatal transmission. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and transmission of hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Transmission'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2967141639\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet and behaviors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be informed about the natural history of HCV infection and counseled on potentially modifiable factors that are associated with accelerated liver disease, including alcohol use, obesity and insulin resistance, and marijuana use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because of the association with more rapid progression of liver disease, we suggest complete avoidance of alcohol for HCV-infected individuals. In addition, we encourage weight loss in obese patients and cessation of cigarettes and marijuana. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-and-alcohol#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis C and alcohol&quot;, section on 'How much alcohol is too much?'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Overview of management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-cannabis-use-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of cannabis use disorder&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We also advise patients that two to three cups of coffee daily can be beneficial to liver health. Coffee consumption (more than two cups per day) has been associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization and mortality from a number of chronic liver diseases including chronic viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and alcoholic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4254442818\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiviral therapy is the cornerstone of treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (see <a href=\"#H1818295792\" class=\"local\">'Antiviral therapy'</a> below). With current antiviral therapies, HCV is relatively easily treated and can be eliminated in almost all patients. Other general measures in the management of patients with chronic HCV include symptom management, dose adjustment of medications, and preventing complications of cirrhosis if present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Fatigue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with HCV infection complain of fatigue. The cause is uncertain and may be difficult to ascribe to liver disease alone rather than other comorbidities such as depression. Fatigue and overall quality of life improve in some patients who have a sustained virologic response (SVR) following antiviral therapy, although the improvements may be modest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

Many patients voice concern about taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> due to its association with liver injury when taken in high doses. Patients do not need to avoid acetaminophen, but we suggest that the dose of acetaminophen not exceed 2 g per 24 hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-adults-pathophysiology-presentation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acetaminophen (paracetamol) poisoning in adults: Pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, for HCV-infected patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, dose adjustments or avoidance of certain medications may be warranted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F90194\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90194 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F90196\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90196 \">table 3</a>). In particular, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be hepatotoxic and should be <strong>avoided</strong> in patients with advanced liver disease. </p><p>While statins are frequently withheld from patients with chronic liver disease, available data fail to show an increased risk of adverse effects in patients with compensated chronic liver disease, suggesting that statin use is safe in patients with stable HCV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In addition, there are some data that suggest statin use is associated with lower fibrosis progression rate and decreased risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>Certain medications, including over-the-counter agents, have interactions with various direct-acting antivirals and may need to be adjusted during therapy. These are discussed in detail elsewhere.

HCV-infected patients with chronic liver disease should also receive pneumococcal vaccination. Details on these vaccinations are discussed elsewhere (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62130\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62130 \">figure 1</a>).

This includes evaluating for clinical signs of liver failure (including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or bleeding from gastroesophageal varices) as well as laboratory testing to identify hepatic dysfunction (hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, or hypoprothrombinemia). Additionally, patients with cirrhosis should be screened for the presence of gastroesophageal varices by upper endoscopy. Patients with advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis should undergo surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) because HCC occurs at a rate of 1 to 4 percent per year. Liver ultrasonography every six months is the recommended method for HCC surveillance.

Attaining an SVR has been associated with decreases in all-cause mortality, liver-related death, need for liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma rates, and liver-related complications, even among those patients with advanced liver fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/14-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-23</a>].

The introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), drugs that target specific nonstructural proteins of HCV and thus disrupt viral replication and infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F94365\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94365 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F93884\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93884 \">table 4</a>), has revolutionized therapy of HCV infection. Highly effective, well-tolerated, all-oral regimens are now the treatment of choice for the vast majority of HCV-infected patients who have access to these agents. The evaluation and selection of patients for antiviral therapy is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Several studies have suggested that these regimens, even at their introductory high cost, are cost-effective for many populations, including those with genotype 1 infection or advanced fibrosis, because of their superior efficacy in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>].

Thus, the main reasons to check viral levels during therapy are to assess adherence to the regimen and to document the treatment course and virologic response in case patients relapse and warrant retreatment. Given the expense of the medicines and the potential risk of viral resistance with inappropriate use, we check HCV RNA quantitative testing at week 4 in clinical practice. The joint guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) additionally recommend rechecking HCV RNA quantitative testing at week 6 if the week 4 level is detectable and discontinuing therapy if the level has increased by &gt;1 log [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Although there are no direct clinical data to support this practice, we agree that this is an appropriate approach. </p><p>The clinical value of a week 12 (or end of treatment) viral level is uncertain, and most providers do not routinely check it. It is undetectable in the vast majority of treated patients, even among those who have subsequent viral relapse.

It is unclear what proportion of these represent cases of HBV reactivation or complications in patients with existing advanced liver disease (including inappropriate use of protease inhibitors in patients with decompensated disease), situations in which the risk of liver failure is higher than the general population.

Sustained virologic response (SVR) is defined by an undetectable viral level at this time point, which is generally maintained through 24 weeks following the cessation of therapy and beyond. However, a very small proportion of patients (less than 1 percent in studies of direct-acting antivirals) experience virologic relapse between weeks 12 and 24, and some of those cases may be reinfection rather than true relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. Thus, some practitioners also check the viral load at 24 weeks to ensure maintenance of SVR. Although SVR reflects effective cure of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, it does not confer immunity to HCV, and patients should be counseled that they are at risk for reinfection with future exposure. </p><p>Patients who achieve an SVR and do not have bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis do not require any specific follow-up for their HCV infection, though some will check an HCV viral load one year after the completion of treatment to confirm that the viral load remains undetectable. </p><p>Patients who fail to achieve an SVR should continue to be followed for signs of progression of liver disease and assessed for retreatment of HCV infection.
