In clinical specimens obtained from patients who have received beta-lactam antibiotics, <em>H. influenzae</em> can appear as filamentous rods. In vitro growth requires a CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched atmosphere, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a> (factor X), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD, factor V); therefore, isolation from clinical specimens on solid medium requires the use of chocolate agar or other X and V factor supplemented media. <em>H. influenzae</em> appear as transparent or slightly opaque colonies on solid media.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Capsule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence or absence of a polysaccharide capsule is an important distinguishing characteristic of <em>H. influenzae</em> species. The polysaccharide capsule can be serologically classified into six serotypes (a through f), while <em>H. influenzae</em> lacking a polysaccharide capsule are considered to be nontypeable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-haemophilus-influenzae/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The type b capsule consists of a ribosyl and ribitol phosphate polymer and is the primary antigenic constituent of polysaccharide and polysaccharide conjugate <em>H. influenzae</em> serotype b (Hib) vaccines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-haemophilus-influenzae/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Nontypeable strains are genetically heterogeneous; some carry genetic elements for capsule production that are not expressed, while other isolates do not have any of these genes and are more distantly related [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-haemophilus-influenzae/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Even among identically classified nontypeable strains, electrophoresis of outer membrane proteins or enzymatic analysis demonstrates great heterogeneity of nonencapsulated strains.</p><p>Infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract are largely caused by nontypeable strains. Nontypeable strains have been classified into eight biotypes based upon the presence or absence of indole, urease, and ornithine decarboxylase. Some biotypes have been associated with specific clinical syndromes; <em>H. influenzae</em> biotype 3 isolates (also known as biotype aegyptius) are associated with the syndrome of Brazilian purpuric fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-haemophilus-influenzae/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and biotype 4 isolates are associated with maternal genitourinary tract infections and neonatal sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-haemophilus-influenzae/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Outer membrane proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The outer membrane of <em>H. influenzae</em> contains several proteins enabling attachment to epithelial cells and facilitating colonization of the human respiratory tract. These include pili, fimbriae, high molecular weight factors (HMW1 and HMW2), and Hia (homologous to the pertussis hemagglutinin). Pili seem to be required for adherence to respiratory mucin and pharyngeal colonization, while the other adhesins may be more influential in the pathogenesis of otitis media [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-haemophilus-influenzae/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].

Hib LPS has limited antigenic diversity, although variability in LPS electrophoretic patterns occurs with passage in vivo or in vitro, making electrophoresis of LPS a less useful epidemiologic tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-haemophilus-influenzae/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. When injected, Hib LPS produces a dermal Shwartzman reaction, is lethal in mice, causes a febrile response, and evokes polyclonal B cell activation in rabbits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-haemophilus-influenzae/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">IgA proteases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the important role of immunoglobulin (Ig)A in mucosal defense, bacterial IgA proteases are likely important virulence factors. <em>H. influenzae</em> produces three types of IgA proteases that cleave different peptide bonds within the IgA1 hinge region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-haemophilus-influenzae/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Intracellular survival</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>H. influenzae</em> can survive within respiratory epithelial cells; this intracellular sequestration may explain the ability of these organisms to colonize the respiratory epithelium for extended periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-haemophilus-influenzae/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Furthermore, <em>H. influenzae</em> can gain access to the subepithelial space, either by transmural migration across epithelial cells or by an independent intercellular mechanism.

Newborns are protected against <em>H. influenzae</em> serotype b (Hib) via maternal antibodies, but they are susceptible to infection with nontypeable (unencapsulated) strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-haemophilus-influenzae/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

As maternal antibody levels wane, children become susceptible to invasive Hib infection from around age three months to three years.</p><p>Prior to the routine use of Hib conjugate vaccines, children older than three years of age progressively gained protection against invasive disease with repeated exposure and subsequent nasopharyngeal colonization. The decline in individual serum anti-Hib antibody levels observed since introduction of Hib vaccination suggests that ongoing antigen exposure in the setting of Hib colonization may play a role Hib immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-haemophilus-influenzae/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>].</p><p>The opsonization of <em>H. influenzae</em> by C3 and subsequent phagocytosis appears to be more important than direct complement-mediated lysis. This understanding is based upon the clinical observation that individuals with deficiencies of early complement components are at increased risk for <em>H. influenzae</em> infections, while those with deficiencies of terminal complement components do not experience heightened susceptibility to the organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-haemophilus-influenzae/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. <em>H. influenzae</em> lipooligosaccharide activates the alternative complement pathway to generate C3b, an important opsonin.

Between 1989 and 2008, 7559 cases of <em>H. influenzae</em> disease were reported in the United States; the estimated mean annual incidence was 1.62 per 100,000 population, and 15 percent of cases were fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-haemophilus-influenzae/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

This incidence was equivalent to approximately 25,000 cases of acquired invasive Hib annually in the United States or invasive infection in 1 per 200 children in the first five years of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-haemophilus-influenzae/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

This risk of secondary infection increased inversely with age; children under four years of age were at greatest risk, and clinical disease was most likely in the first 30 days after exposure to the index case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-haemophilus-influenzae/abstract/26-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-32</a>].</p><p>However, the widespread use of conjugate Hib vaccines in infancy has resulted in a dramatic decline in invasive Hib disease in children to one case or less per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-haemophilus-influenzae/abstract/4,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,33</a>]. The incidence of invasive disease among individuals over five years of age has been stable at approximately 0.5 per 100,000 population.</p><p>Hib immunization has reduced carriage (and presumably transmission) and facilitated herd immunity. This reduction in carriage seems to be influenced by number and type of Hib immunizations as well as time post immunization. Consequently, the differences in immunization schedules internationally may result in differing carriage and disease patterns. In England following a period of time when only infant Hib vaccination was practiced (without a toddler booster), there was waning immunity and some recurrence of Hib disease among toddlers. Investigators found that the point prevalence of Hib carriage among 855 British children ages 6 to 16 during this period (between 1999 and 2003) remained high (4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-haemophilus-influenzae/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The global burden of Hib disease is substantial; worldwide, Hib caused about 8.13 million serious illnesses worldwide in 2000, with 371,000 deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-haemophilus-influenzae/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

An etiologic diagnosis is not usually sought, as empiric treatment for these clinical entities are typically adequate to treat these pathogens. For invasive disease such as bacteremia, sepsis, and meningitis, traditional culture methods are typically used to identify the pathogen. The microbiologic characteristics and growth requirements for <em>H. influenzae</em> are noted above. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p>It is important to note that <em>H. influenzae</em> can be a common colonizer of the respiratory tract. Therefore, isolation of this organism from a nonsterile site (such as a respiratory culture or induced sputum) may indicate causative infection or it may represent one of multiple colonizers.</p><p>Newer microbiologic methods are being developed, some of which are commercially licensed. These methods include nucleic acid amplification techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and ribosomal amplification, as well as matrix-assisted laser <span class=\"nowrap\">desorption/ionization</span> time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The PCR-based assays are typically real-time multiplex PCR panels for specific specimen types containing primers to detect multiple types of causative organisms for a particular disease entity (such as a meningoencephalitis panel for cerebrospinal fluid).

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>H. influenzae</em> are small, pleomorphic gram-negative rods that are oxidase positive, facultatively anaerobic, and nonmotile. The presence or absence of a polysaccharide capsule is an important distinguishing characteristic of <em>H. influenzae</em> species. The polysaccharide capsule can be serologically classified into six serotypes (a through f), while <em>H. influenzae</em> lacking a polysaccharide capsule are considered to be nontypeable. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By 18 months of age, one-third of children have had <em>H. influenzae</em> nasopharyngeal colonization with both typeable and nontypeable <em>H. influenzae</em>. Carriage rates in households or daycare centers with an index case can exceed 60 percent. Colonization can persist for months, and intercurrent upper respiratory infection may promote invasive disease as well as enhance spread among close contacts. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to age, factors conferring increased risk for <em>H. influenzae</em> infection include underlying immunocompromising conditions, including complement deficiency, hypogammaglobulinemia, sickle cell anemia, functional asplenia, malignancy, and HIV. In adults, underlying conditions such as chronic pulmonary disease, smoking, HIV, alcoholism, pregnancy, malignancy, and older age increase the risk of <em>H. influenzae</em> disease. Socioeconomic risk factors that increase risk include crowding, poor immunization, and daycare attendance. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to the routine use of <em>H. influenzae</em> serotype b (Hib) conjugate vaccines in infants, invasive Hib was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children; 85 percent of these infections occurred in children under five years of age. Hib was also a leading cause of epiglottitis, pneumonia, empyema, pericarditis, bacteremia, and septic arthritis. Clinical manifestations of invasive Hib infections reflect the organism's capacity for vascular invasion and establishing metastatic foci of infection including meningitis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and cellulitis. Most cases of invasive <em>H. influenzae</em> infection since introduction of the Hib vaccination have been attributable to non-type B strains. (See <a href=\"#H3309804739\" class=\"local\">'H. influenzae serotype b'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nontypeable <em>H. influenzae</em> (NTHi) can cause community-acquired pneumonia in adults and may be associated with severe disease and high mortality in higher risk populations. Although bacteremia that complicates <em>H. influenzae</em> pneumonia occurs occasionally, disseminated infections following NTHi bacteremia are uncommon, except in newborns and immunocompromised patients. NTHi can also colonize the female genital tract and cause locally invasive disease, such as endometritis, amnionitis, or Bartholin gland abscess, with or without accompanying bacteremia. (See <a href=\"#H1159655715\" class=\"local\">'Nontypeable H. influenzae'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For noninvasive disease entities caused by <em>H. influenzae</em>, the diagnosis is usually made clinically, and empiric antimicrobial regimens typically provide activity against this pathogen. Traditional culture methods may be employed to identify <em>H. influenzae</em>. Emerging methods such as polymerase chain reaction (available in multiplex panels commercially) and matrix-assisted laser <span class=\"nowrap\">desorption/ionization</span> time-of-flight mass spectrometry may allow for more rapid diagnosis compared with traditional culture methods and identification of the pathogen when prior antibiotics have been used. (See <a href=\"#H852766455\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of specific syndromes attributable to <em>H. influenzae</em> is discussed in detail separately. In general, beta-lactam agents (eg, penicillins, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>, or second- or third-generation cephalosporins) are the preferred antimicrobial agents if the organism is susceptible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64816\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64816 \">table 1</a>).
