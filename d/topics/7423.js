These <span class=\"nowrap\">foods/food</span> groups are milk, egg, peanut, soy, nuts from trees, fish, shellfish, and seeds. However, virtually any food can trigger an allergic reaction in some people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review clinically relevant features of food allergens, including (when known) epidemiology, natural course, practical observations, and cross-reactivity. Other topic reviews discuss molecular aspects of food allergens, evaluation of food allergies, avoidance of food allergens, the natural history of food allergy, and oral allergy syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-features-of-food-allergens\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular features of food allergens&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-avoidance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Avoidance&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergy in children: Prevalence, natural history, and monitoring for resolution&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF CROSS-REACTIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a patient has a confirmed allergy to one food, evaluation of related foods may be indicated to determine if these foods are also problematic. However, a &quot;positive&quot; allergy test to a related food may simply represent immunologic cross-reactivity due to the presence of a homologous protein that does not have clinical significance, which is more common than true clinical cross-reactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, an individual with an allergy to peanut (a legume) is likely to have &quot;positive&quot; serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) tests or skin prick tests to multiple legumes that are clinically tolerated (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Legume cross-reactivity'</a> below). Approximate rates of clinical cross-reactivity are summarized in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77726\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77726 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Concern about allergy can arise if a related food was never ingested or was not a regular part of the diet and was not recently ingested. In these cases, it may be reasonable to evaluate the patient for allergy to the related food to determine clinical tolerance, depending upon epidemiologic, social, and nutritional consequences and concerns. Further evaluation is generally not needed if a related food is already ingested routinely without reactions.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tree nuts, fish, and shellfish are more commonly clinically cross-reactive. Caution and possible allergy testing (including oral food challenges) are warranted if ingestion of related foods not already tolerated is being considered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes are less cross-reactive, and <span class=\"nowrap\">evaluation/individualization</span> is generally recommended to expand the diet.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5076285\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of clinical manifestations are observed with both immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated and cell-mediated etiologies for food allergies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. IgE-mediated reactions include urticaria and angioedema, rhinoconjunctivitis, gastrointestinal anaphylaxis, generalized anaphylaxis, and oral allergy syndrome. Non-IgE-mediated food allergies present more as subacute <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic symptoms that are commonly isolated to the gastrointestinal tract or skin. These manifestations are reviewed in greater detail separately and briefly for the specific foods discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">COW'S MILK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several prospective, epidemiologic studies indicate that cow's milk allergy (CMA) affects up to 2.5 percent of infants and overall approximately 0.9 percent of the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Tolerance is often achieved by age three to five years, although persistence beyond this age is increasingly reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The rate of allergy loss slows after the age of five years but may occur through adolescence. Non-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy of infancy resolves more quickly than IgE-mediated allergy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergy in children: Prevalence, natural history, and monitoring for resolution&quot;, section on 'Cow's milk'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>IgE antibodies are directed against a variety of allergenic proteins in cow's milk, including casein and whey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Reactions to cow's milk can be severe, and even fatal anaphylaxis from CMA has occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Some cow's milk-allergic children tolerate small amounts of cow's milk protein, generally in a more processed form (eg, dairy in baked goods) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Milk allergy: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Alternative mammalian milks have been considered as substitutes in cow's milk-allergic individuals. Unfortunately, most of the readily available animal milks are problematic for those with CMA. In vitro studies show extensive cross-reactivity among sheep (ewe), cow, and goat milks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and among cow, sheep, goat, and buffalo milks, with no significant binding to camel's milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Oral challenge studies of goat's milk show this to be unsafe for patients with CMA since 92 percent (24 of 26) reacted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, only 4 percent (1 of 25) of children with CMA allergy reacted to mare's milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Ass's (donkey's) milk may also be less allergenic for those with CMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Individuals may also experience allergy to goat&rsquo;s or sheep&rsquo;s milk but tolerate cow&rsquo;s milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milk-allergy-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Milk allergy: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Infants with IgE-mediated CMA usually tolerate soy (approximately 85 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] or extensively hydrolyzed cow's milk-based formulas (approximately 95 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Children with non-IgE-mediated CMA may be less likely to tolerate soy. Other alternatives to mammalian milks are available for toddlers and older children. These alternatives are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Nutritional issues&quot;, section on 'Cow's milk allergy'</a>.)</p><p>Between 13 and 20 percent of children with IgE-mediated CMA in referred populations also react to beef [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Heating and other cooking processes can reduce the allergenicity of beef [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], so well-cooked beef is less likely to cause a problem for those with CMA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">HEN'S EGG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergy to hen's egg affects up to 2.5 percent of <span class=\"nowrap\">infants/young</span> children and overall approximately 0.3 percent of the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/4,6,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,24</a>]. Tolerance is usually achieved by age five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. However, the rate of resolution of egg allergy may be slowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The major allergenic proteins are found in the egg white. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergy in children: Prevalence, natural history, and monitoring for resolution&quot;, section on 'Hen's egg'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Egg allergy: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=egg-allergy-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Egg allergy: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sensitization to hen's egg in infancy is associated with an increased risk of sensitization to respiratory allergens later in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Allergic responses to egg can be severe, and death from egg-induced anaphylaxis has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Some egg-sensitized children tolerate egg in baked products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Others develop urticaria from skin contact with egg and yet ingest it without symptoms. This phenomenon appears to occur when immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies are directed against some of the more labile epitopes of allergenic hen's egg proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>Cross-reactive proteins among various avian egg proteins are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], but the clinical implications have not been systematically studied. Reactions to duck and goose egg, in the absence of hen's egg allergy, have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Some patients with hen's egg allergy also react to chicken meat. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Meats'</a> below.)</p><p>Dietary substitutes for egg are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Nutritional issues&quot;, section on 'Egg allergy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">LEGUMES: PEANUT, SOY, AND OTHERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peanut and soy are prominent legume allergens. Legumes share homologous proteins (conserved proteins), but features of clinical reactions vary. Regional dietary habits and pollen exposure may influence the epidemiology of legume allergy. As an example, allergy to lentil is more common than peanut allergy in Spain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Peanut</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergy to peanut affects approximately 0.75 percent of the general population. Prevalence appears to be increasing, at least among children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/4,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,35</a>].

Recurrence of resolved peanut allergy has been observed. The main risk factor for recurrence was discontinuation of peanut ingestion for many months after the successful food challenge. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergy in children: Prevalence, natural history, and monitoring for resolution&quot;, section on 'Peanut and tree nut'</a>.)</p><p>Peanut allergy is potentially severe. Peanut-allergic reactions are generally the most common culprit in case series of fatal food-induced anaphylaxis. The highest-risk group is adolescents with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/9,10,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,36</a>].

However, processing variations exist, and sources may not be easily traced, so avoidance of even refined peanut oils may be advisable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>].</p><p>The majority of peanut-allergic individuals react to non-pollen-related stable proteins that result in systemic and potentially severe reactions. However, peanut also contains birch pollen-related proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>] and may cause oral allergy syndrome in a subset of birch pollen-allergic individuals.

Soy allergy affects primarily infants and young children. Population prevalence has not been widely studied but appears to be up to 0.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Soy allergy is typically transient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Deaths from soy allergy are rare and have been reported primarily in Sweden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Processed soybean oil is typically considered safe for patients with soy allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Soy lecithin is a phospholipid derivative of soy that contains a trace amount of soy protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. It is used commonly as a processing aid in food products. The risk of residual protein in soy lecithin triggering a reaction in a person with soy allergy has not been extensively studied. We generally do not instruct patients with soy allergy to avoid soy lecithin. Fermentation of soy may reduce the allergenicity, but no studies have evaluated the relative risks of ingestion of these foods by persons with soy allergy. Presumably, soy protein <span class=\"nowrap\">content/allergenicity</span> varies among these products (eg, soy sauce, miso, tempeh, and natto), and reactions may depend upon the product and the individual's sensitivity. However, there are case reports of Japanese adults and children with late-onset, IgE-mediated anaphylaxis to natto mucilage thought to be related to development of an allergy to poly-gamma-glutamic acid (PGA) after a jellyfish sting, akin to sensitization to the carbohydrate allergen alpha-gal after a multiple tick bites and development of red meat allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/47-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-52</a>]. Although PGA may be found in a variety of products other than natto, reactions have been rarely reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergy in children: Prevalence, natural history, and monitoring for resolution&quot;, section on 'Peanut and tree nut'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peanut, tree nut, and seed allergy: Clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peanut, tree nut, and seed allergy: Diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peanut, tree nut, and seed allergy: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Tree nut-allergic reactions can be severe and account for a relatively high proportion of fatal reactions in several case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/9,10,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,36</a>]. Variation in severity of clinical reactions may be related in part to the particular proteins to which immune responses are directed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>As an example, certain nuts (eg, almond, hazelnut) contain labile proteins that are pollen cross-reactive (eg, birch). Exposure to these proteins leads to localized symptoms of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome). These nuts also contain stable proteins. Sensitization to these proteins most likely occurs through the gastrointestinal route or possibly the skin. Stable proteins are more likely to trigger systemic reactions.</p><p>Certain tree nuts also share homologous proteins with peanut and other tree nuts, as shown by inhibition assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. A high rate of coallergy to peanut and some tree nuts (30 to 50 percent) is observed among referral populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/55,74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,74,75</a>]. The clinical relevance of such observations is not fully explored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>Serological studies have indicated a high degree of immunoglobulin E (IgE) binding to multiple tree nuts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/55,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,75</a>]. Challenges to one or more tree nuts were performed in 14 children, and at least two reacted to multiple nuts (as many as five types) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Coallergy to multiple tree nuts was reported in over one-third of patients evaluated for tree nut allergy in two series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/55,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,76</a>].</p><p>Certain tree nut allergies appear to coexist more commonly, such as cashew and pistachio or walnut and pecan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/41,75,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,75,77</a>]. Cross-reactivity is seen among pistachio, cashew, and mango seed (but NOT the fruit) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Proteins homologous to cashew may also be found in fruit seeds, with rare reports of reactions if the seeds are eaten [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/79-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-81</a>]. Coconut is sometimes considered a nut because it shares homologous proteins with walnut; however, it is not a common allergen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/75,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,82</a>].</p><p>Some authorities suggest avoidance of all tree nuts for people with peanut allergy or any single tree nut allergy because of safety concerns (eg, cross-contact) and epidemiologic risks. However, others feel individualization is possible when tree nuts known to be tolerated are eaten without risk of cross-contact with causal ones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/55,83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,83,84</a>]. We take into consideration the age of the child, test results, potential cross-reactivity of the nuts (eg, we do not typically allow pistachio if a patient has an allergy to cashew), and <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span> preferences before suggesting liberalization of the diet to include some nuts and not others. If certain nuts are consumed, we review issues of cross-contact and avoidance. As an example, we may instruct the patient to only eat the allowed nut(s) from the shell.

Briefly, there is a high rate of clinical cross-reactivity among fish and among shellfish because of homologous proteins (tropomyosin for shellfish and parvalbumin for finned fish) but not between fish and shellfish. The amount of expressed parvalbumin may partly account for variation among allergenicity of various finned fish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seafood allergies: Fish and shellfish&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">GRAINS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wheat allergy is the most common of the cereal grain allergies. The prevalence of allergy to other cereal grains (eg, rye, barley, oat, rice) is not well studied. Cereal grains share homologous proteins with grass pollens and each other. This may account for the high rate of sensitization to these foods. However, rates of clinical reactivity are much lower.</p><p>The variety of adverse immune responses to wheat include acute immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions, inhalational reactions (eg, Baker's asthma), reactions that occur when wheat ingestion is followed by exercise (eg, wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis [WDEIA]), and cell-mediated reactions (eg, atopic dermatitis and gastrointestinal allergic disorders, including celiac disease). The type of immune response and triggering allergen partially define the clinical manifestation of the allergy. As examples, Baker's asthma is caused by inhalation of water-soluble proteins, and IgE to omega-5-gliadin is responsible for acute reactions in children and in WDEIA. IgE-mediated reactions are most commonly seen in children and usually resolve in the preschool years, except for exercise-associated reactions. Inhalation reactions are seen more often in adults, especially those with occupational exposures.</p><p>Food allergy to grains is discussed in greater detail separately, as are dietary alternatives to wheat.

Meat allergy is usually outgrown in childhood and is rare in adults. Three general patterns of cross-reactivity or coallergy are noted in patients with meat allergy: reactions to meats from related species, reactions to meat and other foods (such as milk or egg), and reactions to meat and animal danders. Sensitization to a carbohydrate allergen, galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal), that is found in tissues of nonprimate mammals including cows, sheep, and pigs is associated with delayed-onset (ie, typically three to six hours after ingestion) systemic reactions to ingestion of meat from these animals. Meat allergy is discussed in greater detail separately.

Another potential carbohydrate allergen is the prebiotic short-chain galactooligosaccharide (scGOS). There are several case series of acute allergic reactions to beverages containing scGOS, including cow's milk formula, in children over two years of age and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity/abstract/100-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">100-102</a>]. Reported symptoms included an itchy rash and lower respiratory symptoms (wheezing, difficulty breathing). These patients tolerated other dairy products and had no history of cow's milk allergy (CMA). All reported cases were from Southeast Asia (Japan, Vietnam, and Singapore), suggesting that there is a primary sensitizing agent specific to the region.
