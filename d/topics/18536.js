Five human prion diseases are currently recognized: kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), Gerstmann-Str&auml;ussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), and fatal familial insomnia (FFI).</p><p>These human prion diseases share certain common neuropathologic features including neuronal loss, proliferation of glial cells, absence of an inflammatory response, and the presence of small vacuoles within the neuropil, which produces a spongiform appearance.</p><p>Variant CJD (vCJD) may be distinguished from cases of typical sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) by the following features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A considerably younger age at the onset of symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less rapid progression of illness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differences in clinical presentation and course</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differences in neuropathology</p><p/><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of variant CJD will be reviewed here. Classic CJD (sporadic, iatrogenic and familial forms of CJD) is discussed separately. The prion diseases Kuru, GSS, and FFI are also discussed separately, as are the biology and genetics of prion diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=creutzfeldt-jakob-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diseases of the central nervous system caused by prions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-genetics-of-prions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and genetics of prions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial reports in 1996 of cases of the new variant of CJD (vCJD) quickly focused intense interest on the human prion diseases, particularly because of the link with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Unique epidemiologic features of this illness led to early recognition that this was indeed a &quot;new variant.&quot; (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H596252628\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence and prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first report of a case of sporadic CJD in a 16-year-old from the United Kingdom appeared in 1995 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and was quickly followed in 1996 by 22 other cases of what was recognized as vCJD. All of these initial cases were from the United Kingdom except for one that was from France [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p>As of March 2014, there have been a total of 228 cases of probable vCJD (dead and alive) reported worldwide, with 177 from the United Kingdom (UK), 27 from France, five in Spain, four in Ireland, three in the United States (US), three in Holland, two in Portugal, Canada and Italy, and one each in Japan, Taiwan, and Saudi Arabia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. Two of the Irish and US cases, as well as those in Canada, Japan, and Portugal are thought to have been infected while residing in the UK. The third US patient is thought to have been infected when living in Saudi Arabia. The other patients are believed to have been infected through meat products, animals, or animal products that were exported from the UK. Similarities between cases reported from different countries suggest that a common strain of infectious agent is involved and therefore a single source of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The true prevalence of vCJD in the United Kingdom is unknown. Studies of lymphoreticular tissue, including tonsils and appendices, have variably estimated the prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/8,10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10-13</a>]. While two studies screening tonsillar tissue found no vCJD positive samples out of a total of over 5000 specimens screened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], other studies have estimated higher prevalences of 120 to 493 per million inhabitants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/8,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,11</a>]. The latter statistic was reported in a large scale survey of 32,441 appendix samples that identified 16 that were positive for vCJD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The much lower and stable to declining number of clinically recognized vCJD cases in the United Kingdom supports a lower prevalence and appears at odds with this result. One explanation may be the finding that genetic testing of the positive appendectomy samples revealed a high proportion that were valine homozygous compared with confirmed clinical cases of vCJD which are virtually all methionine homozygous at PRNP codon 129 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> below.) Prospective collection and anonymous testing of tonsillar tissue for PrPSc in the United Kingdom was approved to begin in 2004 and may provide more accurate estimates of vCJD prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Relationship with BSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is increasing evidence supporting the possibility that vCJD represents bovine-to-human transmission of BSE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The appearance of vCJD followed an epidemic of BSE in the United Kingdom. The removal of organic solvents, which inactivate PrPSc, from the rendering process for bovine offal, and the subsequent use of the offal as a component of feed for cattle has been hypothesized to be a mechanism for amplifying the epidemic in animals.</p><p>The source of BSE remains unclear. The first cases were recognized in 1986. Theories of its origination include the transmission of either sheep scrapie or another prion disease to cattle via contaminated feed; it has even been speculated that the original source was human CJD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. An intrinsic genetic event in cattle seems less likely.</p><p>The demonstration that PrPSc adheres to certain soil minerals and remains infectious suggests the possibility that soil may represent a previously unidentified environmental reservoir for prions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This may contribute to the transmission of prion diseases in sheep, deer, and elk through shedding from diseased animals and decomposition of infected carcasses. In support of this theory, BSE has been experimentally transmitted to sheep, which subsequently demonstrate infectivity in the absence of clinical symptoms (ie, are silent carriers of BSE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Approximately 50,000 infected cattle are estimated to have entered the human food chain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A number of governmental regulations in the United Kingdom, particularly the prohibition on ruminant-derived proteins in feeds for all animals and poultry in November 1990 and the banning of consumption of animals over the age of 30 months in March 1996, have led to a dramatic decline in cases of BSE, since the peak incidence in 1992.</p><p>Evidence in favor of the association of vCJD and BSE includes the type 4 pattern of PrPSc (Collinge nomenclature), which has not been seen in other prion diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A case control study of vCJD in Great Britain associated a frequent consumption of beef and beef products and also chicken with increased risk for vCJD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Surgical, occupational, and other animal exposures were similar between cases and controls. While recall bias may have contributed to these results, they support the hypothesis that dietary exposure is the main route of infection of vCJD. Despite the apparent link between vCJD and BSE, the number of cases of vCJD has remained small. Possible reasons for this observation include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low levels of PrPSc in milk and meat, which are the main bovine products consumed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inefficiency of the oral route of infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restriction of spread based upon a species barrier</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low incidence of host genetic factors such as the frequency of homozygosity at codon 129</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">North American BSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renewed concern about vCJD was sparked with the finding in May 2003 of a cow with BSE from Alberta, Canada. The first BSE case in the United States, confirmed in December 2003, was found in a Washington state dairy cow that had been slaughtered with meat sent to market [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The cow had been tested for BSE randomly because it was a &quot;downer,&quot; an animal unable to stand. Subsequent DNA analysis on the 6.5-year-old animal revealed that it had been born in Alberta, Canada. A number of beef importers from the United States closed their markets to further imports.</p><p>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) confirmed in January 2005 that a second indigenous Alberta dairy cow born in 1996 (prior to the 1997 Canada ban on animal parts in feed) had tested positive for BSE. No part of the animal entered the human food or animal feed systems. As of January 2005, a total of three cases of BSE have been found in older cows originally from Alberta.</p><p>The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a series of measures designed to safeguard the food supply in December 2003, including an immediate ban on the slaughter of &quot;downer&quot; cattle for food consumption, holding for later release carcasses of animals tested for BSE until the tests are negative, and prohibition of use of advanced meat recovery specimens from skull, brain, trigeminal ganglia, eyes, vertebral column, spinal cord, or dorsal root ganglia from cattle &ge;30 months of age at slaughter and tonsils and small intestine from all cattle. The United States tested 426,164 animals for BSE from June 1, 2004 through August 1, 2005. One cow originally traced to Canada was reported as positive in November 2004. Another was reported as having a non-definitive test result in July 2005, which will be followed for further testing. Updated USDA information regarding BSE testing is available online (<a href=\"http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/animal_diseases/bse/monthly_surv_test.shtml&amp;token=QFH0amm+B/uovJUzZ6ILZJNoPQiwb8y0QECs3mWHZyQETXI5Z0wrj2InKDddhWijnwd8VUHXlNuSPIouYHV3+bK4P7uwHwQHemJYNzCdQVE=&amp;TOPIC_ID=15872\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/animal_diseases/bse/monthly_surv_test.shtml</a>).</p><p>In December 2004, the USDA announced a rule recognizing Canada as a &quot;minimal risk region&quot; for BSE. This permits resumption of imports of live cattle less than 30 months of age and certain other beef products from Canada to the United States as of March 7, 2005. The subsequent finding in January 2005 of another Alberta cow with BSE did not impact on the scheduled implementation of the USDA rule. &#160;As of March 2011, 19 cases of Canadian born cattle had been identified; of these, 12 were born after March 1 1999, several years after the imposition of the 1997 Canadian feed ban. A stricter Canadian feed ban, which restricts risk materials in all animal feed, went into effect in 2007. It is possible that these younger cattle had a sporadic 'atypical' form of BSE. A 10 year old Californian dairy cow tested positive for BSE in April 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The USDA conducted a thorough epidemiologic investigation. Eleven of the twelve feed suppliers were in full regulatory compliance; the last supplier had gone out of business. No other cows in the index case&rsquo;s birth cohort, nor cows that shared living facilities, had evidence of disease. </p><p>The USDA approach is based on guidelines established by the World Organization for Animal Health (Office International des Epizooties or OIE). Under the OIE guidelines, a country may be considered a minimal-risk country for BSE, if it has less than two BSE cases per million cattle over 24 months of age during each of the previous four consecutive years. Canada has roughly 5.5 million cattle over 24 months of age. Thus, up to 11 detected cases of BSE in the Canada cattle population would be permitted in a four-consecutive-year period in the minimal-risk country category, as long as Canadian risk mitigation and other preventive measures were thought to be effective.</p><p>Updated information on the number of BSE cases reported throughout the world in imported or indigenous cattle is available online from the OIE website (<a href=\"http://www.oie.int/&amp;token=dfMPJnDanZK/e4gkRhWw0l6C0ZG/qQDTE3TQPDRZEok=&amp;TOPIC_ID=15872\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.oie.int</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Transfusion-related vCJD</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H152871578\"><span class=\"h3\">Reported cases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Four, possibly five, cases of transfusion transmission of vCJD in the United Kingdom have been reported. One case involved the onset of vCJD in a patient 6.5 years after a transfusion of red cells; the donor had developed symptoms of vCJD 3.5 years after donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although this association raised the possibility of transfusion-associated transmission of vCJD, dietary exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the recipient could not be excluded.</p><p>The second case involved a recipient with no evidence of a neurologic disorder, who died five years after receiving a blood transfusion. The donor developed symptoms of vCJD 18 months after donation, and vCJD was confirmed in the donor at autopsy. The recipient was found to have protease-resistant prion protein in splenic but not brain tissue at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Since the recipient was heterozygous at codon 129 of PRNP, the detection of protease-resistant prion protein in this individual suggests that susceptibility to vCJD infection is not confined to the methionine homozygous PRNP genotype. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> below.) The PRNP codon 129 genotype may limit the prion load or distribution in tissues as well as the clinical expression of disease, making the public health implications of this report less clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The third patient was diagnosed with vCJD premortem and had postmortem pathologic confirmation of disease 15 months after presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. He presented in 2005 with a six-month history of progressive neurologic deficits. He had ulcerative colitis and had received a transfusion in 1997 (7.5 years earlier) after a complicated surgical procedure. One of the blood donors had developed vCJD 20 months after donating the blood and had pathologic confirmation of the disease at postmortem 11 months later. Both donor and recipient were homozygous for methionine at PRNP codon 129. The same blood donor in the third case was implicated in the fourth patient with probably transfusion-related vCJD, who developed symptoms of vCJD 8.5 years after receiving a blood transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/7,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,26</a>]. Investigation of a fifth possible case of transfusion-related vCJD suggests that it may instead have occurred by transmission of BSE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Studies in mice infected with vCJD have demonstrated that secondary infection can occur in MV and VV as well as in MM lines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In this study, MM and MV lines were the most susceptible to transmission. These findings, with a long preclinical phase predicted in these models, suggest that transfusion-related vCJD may represent a persistent health risk. Further cause for concern comes from case reports of Kuru after more than 50 years of incubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-genetics-of-prions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and genetics of prions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H152871584\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of a reliable blood test to detect preclinical vCJD, efforts to prevent transfusion-related vCJD have focused on restriction blood donation from high risk individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Reports of cases of confirmed vCJD who have little to no detectable prion protein in peripheral lymphoreticular tissue suggest that blood testing may have an inherently low sensitivity for disease detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. One prototype blood-based vCJD assay has been developed that appears to have sufficient sensitivity and specificity and is being investigated for screening population samples and at-risk groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>New restrictions were instituted in the United Kingdom in 2004 because of the demonstration of probable blood borne vCJD transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Recipients of blood, plasma, or tissue since 1980 were excluded as donors. In addition, recipients of vCJD-implicated plasma products and their physicians were being contacted and asked to inform other practitioners of their status in advance of any future medical, surgical, or dental treatment. Beginning in November, 1999, leukocyte depletion of all blood components was mandated in the United Kingdom in order to reduce the concentration of transmissible agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. All four documented cases of transfusion-related vCJD received transfusions of non-leukocyte depleted red blood cells between 1996 and 1999 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Other risk-reduction measures, including a blood-based assay to detect vCJD, are in development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/36-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-41</a>].</p><p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adopted a policy that a prospective blood donor be indefinitely deferred if he or she had lived for more than six months in the United Kingdom during the peak years of BSE (1981 through 1996) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. This policy went into effect in April, 2000, to attempt to balance increased safety against decreased blood availability.</p><p>The American Red Cross has adopted even more stringent deferral criteria. These include deferral of anyone receiving a blood transfusion in the United Kingdom, anyone residing or visiting the United Kingdom for three or more months since 1980, and anyone visiting or residing in another European country, Turkey, or Oman for six or more months since 1980. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-medical-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Medical history&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While several countries have started to restrict persons who have received a blood transfusion from donating blood, such a policy would not have prevented the first two cases of tranfusion-related vCJD discussed above. Furthermore, a mathematical model based on epidemiologic data suggests that such a policy would prevent less than 1 percent of future vCJD cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>There is no evidence of vertical transmission (mother to child) of vCJD, although the potentially long incubation period for this mechanism makes it difficult to exclude this possibility definitively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mean age at onset of vCJD in the initial report was 29 years (range 16 to 48 years) compared with 65 years for sCJD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. However, patients presenting with vCJD at ages 11 and 74 years have subsequently been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. </p><p>Patients with vCJD frequently displayed prominent sensory disturbances and psychiatric symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. Psychiatric symptoms are the presenting manifestations in 60 to 65 percent of patients and include depression, apathy, anxiety, irritability, social withdrawal, agitation, and insomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>].

Sensory abnormalities may be seen early on and include dysesthesias and paresthesias of the face, hands, feet, legs, or even the hemibody, often without abnormalities on examination. As the disease progresses, other neurologic signs, gait ataxia and dysarthria appear, quickly followed by cognitive impairment, involuntary movements, immobility, unresponsiveness, and mutism.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=creutzfeldt-jakob-disease#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;, section on 'Molecular subtypes of sCJD'</a>.)</p><p>Another feature that distinguishes vCJD from sCJD is its prominent tropism for lymphoid organs such as the tonsils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/60-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-65</a>]. This property may facilitate the determination of vCJD prevalence and detection of subclinical prion infection by examination of tonsillar tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/10,11,13,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,13,66</a>].

The most prominent is the presence of amyloid plaques, which stain intensely for PrPSc, distributed throughout the cerebrum and cerebellum and to a lesser degree the basal ganglia and thalamus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The plaques have an eosinophilic center and pale periphery with surrounding spongiform changes (&quot;florid&quot; and &quot;cluster&quot; plaques) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Cases of kuru and GSS have similar, but not identical, plaques. As noted above, PrPSc extracted from the brains of vCJD cases also has the distinct type 4 pattern, determined by electrophoretic mobility and glycosylation pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lumbar puncture, neuroimaging, electroencephalography, examination of tonsillar tissue, and brain biopsy all may be part of the evaluation of the patient with possible vCJD. Magnetic resonance imaging is the most useful noninvasive test in the positive diagnosis of vCJD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Lumbar puncture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies are rarely helpful in the diagnosis of vCJD, but may be performed to exclude infections and other possible causes of the patient&rsquo;s symptoms. In the original series of 14 patients, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) had no cells in any of the patients and a mildly elevated protein in four [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Detection of the 14-3-3 protein in CSF is not a sensitive marker for vCJD; the protein has been detected in CSF of fewer than half of the patients tested. It was suggested subsequently that the combination of a CSF 14-3-3 protein assay and measurement of CSF tau protein may be useful in the identification of patients with vCJD, but additional studies are required to determine the sensitivity and specificity of combining these CSF markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in vCJD may show signal hyperintensity in the pulvinar (pulvinar sign) or in both pulvinar and dorsomedial thalamus (hockey stick sign) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. In one series, 28 of 36 cases of vCJD and none of 57 controls demonstrated prominent bilateral pulvinar high signal, for a sensitivity and specificity of 78 and 100 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. The pulvinar sign may disappear in follow-up MRIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>].</p><p>Fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) images appear to be the most sensitive sequence for identifying this sign; diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) may also show these abnormalities, but the potential sensitivity of this technique in vCJD is undetermined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. However, DWI may be more sensitive than conventional MRI in detecting abnormalities in sCJD. The utility of DWI is discussed in the section on sCJD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=creutzfeldt-jakob-disease#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;, section on 'MR imaging'</a>.)</p><p>Head CT is usually normal. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has demonstrated decreased perfusion in four patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>], but the clinical utility of SPECT for this condition has not been demonstrated in large studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Electroencephalography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWCs) characteristic of sCJD are generally not seen in vCJD, except rarely in the later stages of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/73,75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,75,76</a>].

Efforts to reduce the spread of vCJD via transfusions include leukocyte depletion of all blood components, now mandated in the United Kingdom and restricting at-risk individuals from donating blood. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Transfusion-related vCJD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar to sporadic CJD, vCJD presents with a progressive course of cognitive decline with prominent neuropsychiatric features often accompanied by sensory symptoms. vCJD presents at a younger age than sporadic CJD and has a more protracted course. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of neuropathologic features distinguish vCJD from sCJD. The most prominent is the presence of florid or cluster amyloid plaques, which stain intensely for PrPSc, distributed throughout the cerebrum and cerebellum and to a lesser degree the basal ganglia and thalamus. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Neuropathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signal hyperintensity in the pulvinar (pulvinar sign) or in both the pulvinar and dorsomedial thalamus (hockey stick sign) on brain MRI is a useful finding with relatively high sensitivity and specificity for vCJD in the appropriate clinical setting. Analysis of PrP extracted from tonsil biopsy tissue also appears to provide a sensitive and specific method for the diagnosis of vCJD in the appropriate clinical context. Detection of the 14-3-3 protein in CSF is not a sensitive marker for vCJD. The periodic sharp wave complexes characteristic of sCJD are generally not seen in vCJD.
