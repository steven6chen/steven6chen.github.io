This is called &quot;emergency contraception&quot; and goes by several other names, including &quot;postcoital contraception,&quot; &quot;the morning after pill,&quot; and &quot;Plan B,&quot; which is the brand name of one of the medications used for emergency contraception. Using emergency contraception should not be confused with taking medicine to induce an abortion, which is a very different medication and process.</p><p>Emergency contraception is a method of birth control to be used <strong>occasionally</strong>, in specific unexpected or emergency situations, not as a primary form of birth control. Other forms of birth control are discussed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barrier-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Barrier methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hormonal methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-acting-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Long-acting methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permanent-sterilization-procedures-for-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Permanent sterilization procedures for women (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasectomy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Vasectomy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO USE EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any woman who has had unprotected sex for any reason can use emergency contraception.

These hormones have been used safely for years.</p><p>Even women who cannot use estrogen-containing hormonal birth control as their primary method of contraception (such as those with a history of heart attack, stroke, clotting disorders, migraine headaches, or liver disease, or who are breastfeeding) can use emergency contraception because the hormones are taken for only one day.</p><p>Some types of emergency contraception do not contain any hormones. These types are the copper intrauterine device (IUD) and a product, ulipristal acetate, which is sold under the brand names ella or ellaOne.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION WORKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Researchers are not certain how emergency contraception works, but they do know that it probably works differently depending on where a woman is in her cycle. It also depends on the type of emergency contraception that she uses. Most of the time, emergency contraception works by reducing the chance that the egg will be fertilized by sperm; intrauterine devices (IUDs) and ella may also reduce the chance that a fertilized egg will implant and begin a pregnancy.</p><p>However it works, one thing is clear: hormonal or intrauterine emergency contraception <strong>cannot</strong> reverse a pregnancy that has already happened. In other words, if a fertilized egg has already implanted itself in the uterus, emergency contraception will not interfere with the pregnancy or harm the baby. Hormonal or intrauterine emergency contraception is not the same as the &quot;abortion pill&quot;, which contains very different medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two main types of emergency contraception, each of which is discussed below. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2301830504\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral emergency contraception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral emergency contraception involves the use of pills that contain hormones or interfere with hormones.</p><p>There are two different regimens of hormone pills, based on the hormones they contain:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common regimen contains a form of the hormone progesterone called levonorgestrel.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The other is a combination regimen containing forms of two hormones: progesterone and estrogen. Pills in this regimen are the same pills used as oral contraceptives, but you must take more than one for them to work as emergency contraception. </p><p/><p>The levonorgestrel regimen is slightly more effective than the combination estrogen-progesterone pills, and less likely to cause nausea and vomiting, the most common side effect of pills used for emergency contraception (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Side effects of emergency contraception'</a> below). </p><p>Levonorgestrel is available in the United States in two different formulations. The brand name for the single-dose regimen is Plan B One-Step, but generic versions are also available. The brand name for the two-dose regimen is Plan B, and it also has generic equivalents.</p><p>Even though levonorgestrel has advantages over estrogen-progesterone, some women find the combination regimen is easier to find. The combination estrogen-progesterone regimen is available by using many commonly prescribed birth control pills in different doses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74604 \">table 1</a>). Birth control pills require a prescription.</p><p>Ulipristal acetate (ella, ellaOne) is another form of oral emergency contraception. This pill works by preventing the hormone progesterone from having its normal effect on ovulation and the inside of the uterus. It is not a hormone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5474502\"><span class=\"h2\">Copper IUD for emergency contraception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An intrauterine device (IUD) can also be used for emergency contraception. The copper IUD is a plastic and copper device that must be inserted into the uterus by a healthcare provider. <strong>It is much more effective at preventing pregnancy</strong> than the pill methods, but requires an office visit, is more costly in the short-term, and is usually used by women who want to keep the IUD as an ongoing method of birth control. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-acting-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Long-acting methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2023727\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW WELL DOES EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION WORK?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a lot of factors that affect how well emergency contraception will work, including where a woman is in her cycle, how soon after unprotected sex the woman takes emergency contraception, what type of emergency contraception she uses, and her weight.</p><p>A woman in her mid-twenties who has sex one to two days <strong>before</strong> she ovulates, when she is most fertile, has about a one in three chance of getting pregnant without contraception. Meanwhile, a woman of the same age who has sex one to two days <strong>after</strong> she ovulates has a near zero chance of getting pregnant. This makes it hard to give concrete numbers to indicate how effective emergency contraception is. Overall, using emergency contraception reduces the chance of pregnancy by at least 50 percent. Of the different methods, the copper IUD is the most effective. After unprotected sex, the chance of pregnancy is less than 1 in 500 in women who have a copper IUD placed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5474509\"><span class=\"h2\">Emergency contraceptive pills less effective in overweight women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies indicate that emergency contraceptive pills, including both levonorgestrel and ulipristal acetate pills, may not work as well in overweight or obese women as they do in normal weight women. For this reason, women who weigh 165 pounds (75 kilograms) or more may want to consider a copper IUD instead of emergency contraceptive pills if they need emergency contraception. The copper IUD works well in woman of any weight. If an overweight woman chooses to use oral emergency contraception, ulipristal seems to be more effective than levonorgestrel. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2201412\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2201418\"><span class=\"h2\">Levonorgestrel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, Plan B One-Step is available on store shelves without a prescription for anyone to purchase without age restrictions. Generic single-dose (1.5 mg) tablets of levonorgestrel and brand and generic two-dose (0.75 mg) tablets of levonorgestrel are also available, but the rules addressing the age and prescription requirements for these are in flux. Some versions may require a prescription, others may be sold only to people who can prove they are at least 17 years of age. Also, the labels for some for these formulations may specify that levonorgestrel emergency contraception is for use in women 17 years of age and older. Despite what these labels say, studies show that levonorgestrel can be used safely and effectively for emergency contraception in women younger than 17 years of age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2201424\"><span class=\"h3\">Get it before you need it</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even though emergency contraception may be available without a prescription, it is not always easy to get to a pharmacy when you need to take the pills. What&rsquo;s more, not all pharmacies carry the medications or make them easily available on the shelf. As a result, healthcare providers recommend that women who are having sex get the pills needed for emergency contraception ahead of time, before they need them, and keep them at home. That is important because the pills are most effective when they are used shortly after unprotected sex. If you would like to buy some emergency contraception, call Planned Parenthood or your local pharmacy to find out if you can get it there. If cost is a concern, ask if you can get a generic version.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2201430\"><span class=\"h2\">Other forms of emergency contraception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ulipristal (brand names: ella, ellaOne) and standard birth control pills (estrogen and a progestin) require a prescription, regardless of age. The copper intrauterine device (IUD) must be placed by a healthcare provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3945941087\"><span class=\"h2\">Online access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you need emergency contraception, it's a good idea to talk with your doctor about your options, if possible. However, in some areas, you can get emergency contraception (including ulipristal and levonorgestrel) through online services such as PRJKT RUBY (www.prjktruby.<span class=\"nowrap\">com/emergency-contraception)</span> and Nurx (www.nurx.com). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW TO TAKE EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You do not need to have a physical exam or any lab tests to take nonprescription emergency contraception. However, if you need emergency contraception because you were raped, you should seek the help of a counselor or other healthcare professional. Your doctor should rule out pregnancy by history, physical exam, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laboratory testing before giving you a prescription for ulipristal for emergency contraception (nonhormonal emergency contraception). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-after-sexual-assault-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Care after sexual assault (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can take emergency contraceptive pills any time during your menstrual cycle. It does not matter when you had your last period.</p><p>Both the levonorgestrel pills and estrogen-progesterone pills are most effective when taken as soon as possible after unprotected sex. You can take them up to 120 hours (5 days) after sex, although the treatment become less effective as more time goes by.</p><p>Ulipristal acetate is effective up to 120 hours (five days) after unprotected sex.</p><p>The intrauterine device (IUD) can also be inserted up to 120 hours (five days) after unprotected sex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Emergency contraception medication and dose</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Levonorgestrel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Levonorgestrel is available in the United States as Plan B, which contains two 0.75 mg tablets to be taken 12 hours apart. However, many healthcare providers suggest taking the two tablets together, rather than 12 hours apart, because it is more convenient, works as well as taking the two pills separately, and is not harmful. Alternately, you can take Plan B One-Step, My Way, or Next Choice One Dose, which contains one 1.5 mg tablet that you take once.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H281158806\"><span class=\"h3\">Ulipristal acetate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ulipristal acetate is available as ella or ellaOne, which consists of a single 30 mg tablet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Estrogen-progesterone pills</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No estrogen-progesterone pill is available in pill packets specifically for emergency contraception. However many birth control pills contain these two hormones. The table provides information on which birth control pills you can take as emergency contraception, and how many pills to take for each dose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74604 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Copper IUD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best way to prevent pregnancy is to have a copper IUD inserted. This makes the most sense if you would like to leave the IUD in place and use it as your ongoing method of birth control, or if you are obese. Copper IUDs are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-acting-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Long-acting methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects of emergency contraception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nausea and vomiting are the most common side effects of the emergency contraceptive pills. These side effects are more common with the combination regimen using pills that contain both estrogen and levonorgestrel than those that contain levonorgestrel alone. Emergency contraception is very safe, which is why some types are now available without a prescription.</p><p>The table shows the percentages of women who experience nausea and vomiting, depending on which type of emergency contraception they take (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77880\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77880 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Side effects for ulipristal acetate are similar to those for levonorgestrel.</p><p>The copper IUD sometimes causes heavier periods. This often gets better with time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Preventing nausea and vomiting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are worried about developing nausea and vomiting, you can take a medication to prevent these side effects.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meclizine is a non-prescription medication that helps prevent nausea and vomiting; it is sold under the brand names Antivert, Bonine, Dramamine, and Medi-Meclizine. It is important to follow the dosing instructions on the box or bottle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metoclopramide (Reglan) is another medication that helps prevent nausea and vomiting, but you'll need to get a prescription for it from your healthcare provider.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">What to do if you vomit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you vomit within an hour after taking levonorgestrel pills, you should take medication for nausea and vomiting and then take then another full dose of levonorgestrel.</p><p>If you vomit within an hour of taking oral contraception pills (estrogen-progesterone pills), you have two choices:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You can either take medication to prevent nausea and vomiting and take the full dose of oral contraceptive pills (estrogen-progesterone pills) again; or</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You can switch to levonorgestrel pills in the hopes that they will not cause the same side effects as the combination pills.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">DO I NEED BIRTH CONTROL?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you take emergency contraception, you will need to use some form of birth control until you get your period. You can still get pregnant if you have unprotected sex again after you take emergency contraception.</p><p>If you normally use birth control pills, a patch, or a vaginal ring, but you missed some doses, you should resume those methods the day following your emergency contraception, although you will need to use a backup form of birth control (such as a condom) for at least seven days. However, if you took ulipristal, and you normally use birth control pills, wait at least <strong>five</strong> days before starting your regular pills again. This is because ulipristal can interfere with the way birth control pills work. Even after you start taking your pills again, you should still use a condom every time you have sex until your next period. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hormonal methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If you normally use condoms, a diaphragm, or a cervical cap, go back to using those methods right away. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barrier-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Barrier methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If you have unprotected sex again, you can take emergency contraception again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN WILL I GET MY PERIOD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your period should come within a week of when it normally comes. Some women have their period a little sooner than expected; others have it a little later than expected. However, if you do not get your period within three or four weeks of taking emergency contraception, you should have a pregnancy test, either at home or in a medical office.</p><p>If your pregnancy test is negative, wait for your menstrual period for one more week. If you still have not had a menstrual period by this time, call your doctor or nurse for further instructions.</p><p>If you are using a hormonal method of birth control (pill, skin patch, vaginal ring, injection), be sure to take the next dose (or apply a new patch or insert a new ring) on schedule, even if you have not had your menstrual period. Call you healthcare provider for further instructions.</p><p>In addition, call your doctor or nurse if you develop stomach pain or unexpected vaginal bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emergency contraception is appropriate for any woman who has had recent unprotected sex for any reason. This includes women who have been raped, and women whose normal method of birth control may have failed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who can't take birth control pills for routine contraception because of medical conditions such as migraine or history of blood clots in the leg or lung can safely take emergency contraception.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A woman does not need a physical exam or any lab tests to get emergency contraception.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who need emergency contraception should take it as soon as possible after unprotected sex.

Doctors also recommend taking levonorgestrel as a single dose of 1.5 mg (2 pills at the same time) rather than as one dose of 0.75 mg followed by a second dose of 0.75 mg 12 hours later (even though that is what the label Plan B recommends). Plan B One-Step, My Way, and Next Choice One Dose come as a single 1.5 mg pill. Ulipristal acetate, where available, can be taken instead of levonorgestrel pills, and may be more effective than levonorgestrel pills for women 72 to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who weigh 165 pounds (75 kilograms) or more may want to consider a copper IUD for emergency contraception because pills may be less effective. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who use emergency contraception do not need to see a healthcare provider after taking it.
