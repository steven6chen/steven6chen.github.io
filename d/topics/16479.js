Many psychiatric disorders that are comorbid with SUDs carry an increased risk of suicidal behavior.

Adoption, twin, and extended-family studies have established the genetic or heritable component of predisposition to tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use disorder. Shared environmental influences are relatively stronger at earlier stages of substance involvement (initiation and use) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorder-in-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. There is considerable overlap in the genetic influences associated with SUDs across drug classes, and shared genetic influences contribute to the commonly observed associations between SUDs and externalizing disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorder-in-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>As with most behavioral and psychiatric disorders, the interplay between genetic risk, temperamental traits, and the environment may predispose specific youth to early use of substances and persistent substance use. Once exposed to substances, brain reward systems reinforce substance use, resulting in repeated use and lower ability to control substance use. As the adolescent brain has not fully matured, the effects of substances on the reward system predispose to more profound effects of substance use compared with older age at initiation of use.</p><p>This research supports an etiologic model of individual differences in substance use, in which initiation and early patterns of use are strongly influenced by social and familial environmental factors, while later levels of use are strongly influenced by genetic factors. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22982125\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute pharmacologic effects of alcohol <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> drug use in adolescents include changes in mood, perception, cognition, and psychomotor performance. </p><p>Chronic physical manifestations of substance use are rarely noted during adolescents due to the relative brief duration of their use careers. Polysubstance use by adolescents appears to be the rule rather than the exception.</p><p>Substance use disorder (SUD) can be distinguished from substance use by the presence of psychosocial impairment and behaviors related to obtaining, using, or recovering from the substance. For most adolescents who try substances, especially alcohol and marijuana, sporadic or low frequency substance use often does not result in an SUD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorder-in-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>SUDs should be considered in an adolescent patient with psychosocial problems <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impairment, although these could be the result of comorbid conditions or due to risk factors that predispose individuals for the development of SUDs. (See <a href=\"#H22982089\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>Psychosocial problems caused by substance use in adolescents are typically related to family, peer, legal, work, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> school factors, or to use in physically hazardous situations. Salient use behaviors connote a substantial level of involvement with substance use (eg, tolerance <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> withdrawal), compulsive use (ie, often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than intended, or a great deal of time is spent to obtain substance or recover from its effects), use with disregard or minimization of consequences of impairment, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> use to the exclusion of other important activities or role obligations. Continued use despite recurrent problems related to use is also a common manifestation of SUDs. (See <a href=\"#H2579631926\" class=\"local\">'DSM-5 diagnostic criteria'</a> below.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations of SUDs in adolescents differ in several respects from SUDs in adults. This is primarily due to adolescents&rsquo; earlier stage of development, shorter duration of substance use, and the types of impairment seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorder-in-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Adults have had a longer duration in which to develop chronic health effects and more opportunities to use substances regularly without the interference of family or school. Adults can purchase alcohol, which adolescents cannot legally do.</p><p>Withdrawal symptoms due to alcohol are uncommon in adolescents; however, other problems related to high blood alcohol levels such as &ldquo;black outs&rdquo; occasionally occur. Substance intoxication may lead to episodes of aggressive behavior, unplanned sexual behavior with questions of consent, and other maladaptive social behavior manifesting poor judgement. &#160; &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22982131\"><span class=\"h1\">COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most adolescents who try alcohol or other drugs do not develop substance use disorders (SUDs).

Screening is appropriate for nonclinical settings, such as schools, as well as clinical settings, such as primary care and non-substance use disorder specialty mental health. Screening does not provide information about the severity of an adolescent&rsquo;s substance use or the presence of a substance use disorder (SUD). A positive screening result identifies the need<strong> </strong>for a comprehensive substance use assessment and based on the results, possible need for treatment. Screening is not a substitute for an assessment. </p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in the United States recommends screening for an adolescent&rsquo;s use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs annually, typically beginning at age 11 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorder-in-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-tests-in-children-and-adolescents#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening tests in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Tobacco, alcohol, and substance use'</a>.)</p><p>AAP guidelines suggest using the <a href=\"http://www.ceasar-boston.org/CRAFFT/screenCRAFFT.php&amp;token=9EZJLFegjPtZJ+3rjbOLuI8axVzp4+qX7+T+CBCffdV/z5E2RyGsvuV0lTvP8BTBtF5wIiofPoin6QIKUx34Cg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=101699\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">CRAFFT screen</a> to identify problematic substance use. The CRAFFT screen is a brief screening tool that has been validated in the adolescent primary care setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorder-in-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. The six CRAFFT screening questions are asked if the adolescent endorses drinking alcohol, smoking marijuana or hashish, or using any other substance to get high during the previous 12 months. Two or more positive answers indicate a positive screen:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>C &ndash; </strong>Have you ever ridden in a <strong>Car</strong> driven by someone (including self) who was high, drunk, or had been using drugs?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>R</strong> &ndash; Have you ever used drugs or alcohol to <strong>Relax</strong>?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>A</strong> &ndash; Do you ever use <strong>Alone</strong>? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>F</strong> &ndash; Do you ever <strong>Forget</strong> things that you did while using?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>F</strong> &ndash; Do <strong>Family or Friends</strong> tell you to cut down?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>T</strong> &ndash; Have you ever gotten into <strong>Trouble </strong>when using?</p><p/><p>The United States National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) recommends that clinicians ask children ages 9 to 11 and adolescents 11 to 14, two questions about alcohol use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorder-in-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ldquo;Do you have any friends who drank beer, wine, or any drink containing alcohol in the past year?&rdquo; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Followed by: &ldquo;How about you &ndash; in the past year, on how many days have you had more than a few sips of beer, wine, or any drink containing alcohol?&rdquo; &#160;</p><p/><p>For the younger youth, less than 14 years of age, any drinking is cause for concern.

Due to high rates of co-occurring SUD in adolescents with mental disorders, a more comprehensive substance use assessment is favored in mental health specialty settings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-of-substance-use-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment of substance use disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to interview questions and screening instruments, the identification of specific risk factors can prompt performance of or referral for a comprehensive assessment, even in the absence of an adolescent&rsquo;s report of regular use or consequences. Such risk factors include a past history of substance use, high-risk behaviors, or moderate to severe high-risk status. (See <a href=\"#H22982089\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22982255\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A comprehensive substance use assessment is a thorough process that includes variables or factors contributing to and maintaining substance abuse, the severity of substance-related problems, and the variety of consequences associated with the adolescent&rsquo;s substance use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-of-substance-use-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment of substance use disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The assessment process is used to identify those individuals who meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder (SUD) diagnosis, and to determine the presence of specific substance use behaviors, the pattern of use, and any consequences of use. The results of a comprehensive assessment will usually identify which individuals require treatment, what level of treatment, and other problems, as well as strengths of the adolescent that may be helpful during treatment. </p><p>A comprehensive evaluation requires assessment of many domains of functioning in the adolescent&rsquo;s life. These domains include substance use behaviors, psychiatric and behavioral problems, school and occupational functioning, family functioning, social competency, history of exposure to trauma, maltreatment or abuse, peer relations, sexual identity and gender identity, and <span class=\"nowrap\">leisure/recreation</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorder-in-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1861850157\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxicology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toxicologic tests or drug screens of bodily fluids (usually urine but also saliva) and of hair samples detect the presence of specific substances. The basic drug screen used consistently across the United States tests for amphetamines, cocaine, cannabis, opioids, and phencyclidine. Many drug screens used outside the United States omit phencyclidine but include tests for benzodiazepines and a wider range of opioids. Individual tests are available for other drugs, including alcohol. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testing-for-drugs-of-abuse-doa\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Testing for drugs of abuse (DOA)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A formal substance use examination by an addictions specialist or psychiatrist should include such testing. Continuing care for an adolescent with an SUD with a goal of maintaining abstinence should include intermittent random urine screening. Primary care clinicians do not routinely use drug screens but may, particularly when the clinician is part of a more comprehensive treatment team and has consent from the adolescent.</p><p>Urine screening optimally includes proper collection techniques, evaluation of positive results, and specific plan(s) of action should the specimen be positive or negative. There are mixed views regarding whether sample collection from an adolescent should be monitored. Prior to testing, the clinician should establish rules regarding the confidentiality of the results.</p><p>A positive specimen indicates only the presence of specific drug(s) and not necessarily the presence of an SUD or a specific pattern of use. Because of the limited time a drug will remain in the urine and possible adulteration, a negative urine screen does not definitively indicate that the adolescent does not use drugs. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22982261\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DSM-5 differs from DSM-IV for substance use disorders (SUDs) and applies to adolescents as well as adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorder-in-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].
