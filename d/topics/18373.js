In most patients, the degree of polyuria is primarily determined by the degree of ADH deficiency or resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-in-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, the urine output may range from 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span> with mild partial DI to over 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span> in patients with severe disease. </p><p>Determinants of the urine output in patients with DI will be discussed here. The diagnosis of DI and the causes and treatment of central and nephrogenic DI are presented elsewhere.

The urine output in normals primarily reflects water intake, which leads to alterations in the plasma osmolality that are sensed by the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus that regulate both antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release and thirst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-in-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In addition to central osmoreceptors, peripheral osmoreceptor neurons that innervate hepatic blood vessels detect osmotic shifts in portal blood and modulate ADH release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-in-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema#H96014898\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)&quot;, section on 'Regulation of plasma tonicity'</a>.) </p><p>Normally, an increase in water intake sequentially lowers the plasma osmolality, decreases ADH secretion, and reduces collecting tubule permeability to water; as a result, the excess water is rapidly excreted in a dilute urine. However, changes in water intake do not result in appropriate changes in urine output in patients with DI because ADH release or effect is relatively fixed. Instead, urine output is relatively constant, regardless of water intake, unless dietary salt <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> protein intake change. Suppose, for example, that a patient has moderately severe nephrogenic DI which, because of the ADH resistance, will not respond to hormone replacement. The urine osmolality in this patient cannot be raised above 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> (normal maximum urine osmolality is 900 to 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg)</span>. In this setting, the excretion of solutes (primarily sodium and potassium salts and urea) is the major determinant of the urine output. If solute excretion is in the usual range (eg, 750 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg),</span> then the daily urine output will be 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span> (750 &divide; 150 = 5). In this patient, urine output will rise if solute excretion is increased and fall if solute excretion is reduced.</p><p>Thus, one way to diminish polyuria in patients with DI is to restrict salt and protein intake, which in turn will reduce the solute load and solute excretion. If, for example, solute excretion fell to 525 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/day,</span> the urine output would fall to 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span>. On the other hand, the degree of polyuria can be enhanced by increasing solute excretion, as often occurs with high-protein hyperalimentation in hospitalized patients. Each gram of protein catabolized produces about 170 mg of urea. Thus, a protein load of 70 g (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> of body weight in a 70 kg adult) will generate approximately 11.2 g of urea nitrogen, which corresponds to approximately 400 mmol of urea. At a typical urine osmolality of 300 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> in solute diureses, an increased urea excretion of this magnitude will require a urine output of 0.8 to 1.3 liters.</p><p>Similar considerations concerning the role of solute intake apply when ADH secretion is relatively fixed at a high level in the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hyponatremia-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh-and-reset-osmostat#H155108392\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hyponatremia: Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and reset osmostat&quot;, section on 'High solute intake'</a>.)</p><p>Cortisol deficiency may minimize the degree of polyuria in patients with combined anterior and posterior pituitary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-in-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Lack of cortisol, via an unknown mechanism, leads to reductions in systemic blood pressure, cardiac output, and renal blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-in-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], all of which will tend to diminish the urine output. Lack of cortisol also may increase ADH release in patients with partial DI (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyponatremia-and-hyperkalemia-in-adrenal-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia in adrenal insufficiency&quot;</a>). Reversal of these effects via the administration of cortisol will unmask the DI, resulting in the rapid onset of polyuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-in-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Development of hyperglycemia and glucosuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The polyuria in DI is typically matched by an equivalent increase in water intake via stimulation of thirst. Some patients cannot take fluids orally and are treated with large volumes of intravenous fluid replacement, usually with dextrose and water solutions. This regimen can induce marked hyperglycemia due to the delivery of glucose at a rate that exceeds endogenous metabolic capacity for glucose even in nondiabetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-in-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The associated glucosuria, acting as an osmotic diuretic, can lead to a clinically confusing increase in the urine output that is now <strong>ADH resistant</strong>. In this setting, however, the urine osmolality is typically above 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> (if ADH has been given) with the polyuria being driven by the solute load. The administration of insulin to correct the hyperglycemia will restore ADH sensitivity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of polyuria and diabetes insipidus&quot;, section on 'Solute diuresis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The polyuria in incomplete central diabetes insipidus (DI) (ie, partial deficiency of antidiuretic hormone [ADH]) is typically exacerbated by pregnancy. The placenta releases vasopressinases that enhance the catabolism of ADH. This is of no clinical importance in normal women but can lead to polyuria when secretory reserve is diminished due to underlying central DI. Treatment is most effective with the analog, dDAVP, which is resistant to the vasopressinases.
