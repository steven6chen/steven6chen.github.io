Although it is active against a wide variety of tumors, newer agents have largely replaced MMC except in anal cancer; outside of the United States, MMC is infrequently used for treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and breast cancer. As with many other chemotherapeutic agents, most of the adverse effects of MMC are dose-related, including myelosuppression (which is typically delayed in onset), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, dementia, and alopecia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitomycin-c-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Pulmonary toxicity associated with MMC is unpredictable, but more likely to occur at higher doses. </p><p>The pulmonary complications associated with MMC therapy will be reviewed here. A general discussion of the clinical presentation, pathogenesis, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and management of antineoplastic agent-induced pulmonary toxicity is presented separately.

As with bronchospasm, in many of these cases, the acute lung injury has occurred in patients treated with combined MMC plus a vinca alkaloid, and symptoms were temporally related to the administration of the vinca alkaloid. However, because there are no reports in which treatment with vinca alkaloids alone produced pulmonary parenchymal toxicity, it has been hypothesized that prior treatment with MMC predisposed patients to this complication. </p><p>A case series of 387 patients reported a 6 percent incidence of acute dyspnea with radiographic abnormalities following combination chemotherapy using MMC and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vindesine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vindesine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a> for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitomycin-c-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Pulmonary toxicity occurs in 3 to 12 percent of patients treated with MMC. Factors such as the dose of MMC, concomitant administration of other drugs (especially vinca alkaloids), supplemental oxygen, and prior thoracic irradiation appear to contribute to the development of pulmonary toxicity. Several types of pulmonary toxicity have been described, including acute bronchoconstriction, acute lung injury, interstitial pneumonitis, thrombotic microangiopathy, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, and exudative pleural effusions. (See <a href=\"#H767182\" class=\"local\">'Incidence and scope'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute bronchospasm</strong> appears to occur primarily in patients who have received a vinca alkaloid in addition to MMC. Bronchospasm generally resolves spontaneously or with bronchodilator within 24 hours. For symptomatic patients with acute bronchoconstriction associated with MMC-vinca alkaloid administration, inhaled short-acting bronchodilator is the treatment of choice. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Albuterol</a> can be given by nebulizer or metered dose inhaler (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68683 \">table 2</a>).

For patients with respiratory failure, the usual dose is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> 250 mg intravenously every six hours for two to three days, followed by oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at a dose of 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily for four to six weeks. For patients with less severe disease, the prednisone dose is used for initial therapy. After this initial high dose phase, prednisone is tapered over four to six weeks and discontinued.
