One kind of minimally invasive surgery involves the use of a &quot;scope,&quot; a viewing device that allows surgeons to look inside the body without opening it up all the way. Another type, called &quot;endovascular surgery,&quot; uses X-rays to see inside the body while the surgeon uses special devices that fit inside the blood vessels. This article is about the type of surgery that involves scopes.</p><p>There are several different types of scopes, but they all work in roughly the same way. They consist of a long, thin tube with a tiny camera and a light on the end. The camera sends pictures of the inside of the body to a TV screen. When doing this type of surgery, the surgeon makes a small incision just big enough for the scope to fit through. He or she also makes 2 or more other incisions that slim tools can fit through. These tools include clamps, scissors, and stitching devices, which the surgeon can control from outside the body. While looking at the picture on the screen, the surgeon uses those tools to do the operation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8509597\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the different types of minimally invasive scope surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are lots of different types (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F89476\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89476 \">figure 1</a>). Their names are based on the body parts that are involved. The scopes used for the different types of surgery are named that way, too:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thoracoscopes are used in the chest for &quot;thoracoscopic surgery.&quot; (&quot;Thorax&quot; is Greek for chest.) This type of surgery can be used to remove pieces of lung or to do certain types of heart surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopes are used in the belly for &quot;laparoscopic surgery.&quot; (&quot;Lapara&quot; is Greek for the space between the bottom of the rib cage and the hips.) This type of surgery can be used to remove the gallbladder, appendix, or uterus, or to do lots of other different procedures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hysteroscopes are used in the uterus and vagina for &quot;hysteroscopic surgery.&quot; (&quot;Hystera&quot; is Greek for womb, or uterus.) This type of surgery can be used to remove abnormal growths in the uterus, or to do a number of different procedures on the uterus and vagina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthroscopes are used inside joints for &quot;arthroscopic surgery.&quot; (&quot;Arthron&quot; is Greek for joint.) This type of surgery can be used to repair or rebuild joints in the knee, shoulder, and hip.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopes go down your throat and into the esophagus, stomach, or intestines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75392\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75392 \">figure 2</a>). (&quot;Endo&quot; is Greek for inside or within.) Most times these scopes are used just to inspect those body parts. Other times, these scopes are used to do a procedure. This might involve getting a small piece of tissue for testing, or opening an area that is too narrow. During surgery, an endoscope can also be inserted directly into one of these body parts to help the surgeon find the problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colonoscopes go up your rectum and into the large intestine, or colon. They are similar to endoscopes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52258\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52258 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8509604\"><span class=\"h1\">How is minimally invasive surgery different from regular surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general &ndash; but not always &ndash; this type of surgery makes recovery easier. That's because:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It usually involves several small wounds, rather than one big one</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The inside of the body does not get as exposed to open air as it would with regular surgery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The organs don't get moved around as much</p><p/><p>Despite all of the differences with regular surgery, minimally invasive surgery is still surgery. People who have it do have some pain, they do often need stitches, and they can develop infections or other problems because of the surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8509611\"><span class=\"h1\">Can patients always choose to have minimally invasive surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. Many procedures can now be done through a minimally invasive approach. But it's not always up to the patient to choose what type of surgery to have. Whether or not a patient can have this type of surgery will depend on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether there is a surgeon available who has enough experience doing the type of surgery the patient needs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Why the patient needs surgery. (As an example, patients who need surgery to remove very large cancers cannot always have minimally invasive procedures.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What other health problems the patient might have</p><p/><p>Even when a patient starts out having minimally invasive surgery, there's no guarantee that the surgery will stay that way. Sometimes surgeons start out doing minimally invasive surgery and then realize that they need to switch to open surgery. This doesn't mean the surgeon has done anything wrong; it's just something that happens sometimes after a surgery gets started.</p><p>If you go in for minimally invasive surgery, be prepared to wake up and find out that you had open surgery. This could happen for a few different reasons, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The surgeon found something unexpected when he or she got started</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The surgeon couldn't see well enough or properly treat the organ he or she was trying to operate on</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding occurred that could not be controlled with a minimally invasive approach</p><p/><p>The important thing to remember is that if a surgeon switches to regular surgery, it is usually to protect the safety of the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8509618\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anesthesia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-surgery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Endovascular surgery (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
