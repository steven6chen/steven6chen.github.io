It can also be heralded by other vital sign changes or the presence of elevated serum lactate levels. The effects of shock are initially reversible but can rapidly become irreversible, resulting in multi-organ failure (MOF) and death. Thus, when a patient presents with undifferentiated hypotension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> is suspected of having shock, it is important that the clinician rapidly identify the etiology so that appropriate therapy can be administered to prevent MOF and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-and-initial-approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-undifferentiated-hypotension-and-shock/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the clinical presentation as well as the initial diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to the adult patient with hypotension and suspected shock of unknown etiology (ie, undifferentiated shock).

Features that are highly suspicious of shock include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tachycardia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oliguria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal mental status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tachypnea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cool, clammy, cyanotic skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic acidosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperlactatemia </p><p/><p>Most clinical features are neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of shock. However, many of the clinical manifestations provide clues to the underlying etiology and are primarily used to narrow the differential diagnosis so that empiric therapies can be administered in a timely fashion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102601465\"><span class=\"h3\">Features of shock</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical clinical features that raise the suspicion for shock include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypotension</strong> &ndash; Hypotension occurs in the majority of patients with shock. Hypotension may be absolute (eg, systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg; mean arterial pressure &lt;65 mmHg), relative (eg, a drop in systolic blood pressure &gt;40 mmHg), orthostatic (&gt;20 mmHg fall in systolic pressure or &gt;10 mmHg fall in diastolic pressure with standing), or profound (eg, vasopressor-dependent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Importantly, patients in the early stages of shock can be normotensive or hypertensive, such that hypotension does <strong>not</strong> have to be present for the diagnosis. Conversely, not every patient who has hypotension has shock (eg, chronic hypotension, drug-induced hypotension, autonomic dysfunction, vasovagal syncope, peripheral vascular disease). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tachycardia</strong> &ndash; Tachycardia is an early compensatory mechanism in patients with shock. It can be isolated or occur in association with hypotension. Importantly, compared with older patients, younger patients develop severe and persistent tachycardia before becoming hypotensive late in the course of shock, a compensatory feature that frequently deflects attention away from the possibility of the presence of shock in this population. Given the frequency of beta-blocker use, awareness of concurrent medications is important to incorporate into the clinical assessment of suspected shock. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tachypnea</strong> &ndash; Tachypnea is an early compensatory mechanism in patients with shock and metabolic acidosis specifically. While elevations in respiratory rate are common amongst hospitalized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-and-initial-approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-undifferentiated-hypotension-and-shock/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], it is a useful tool to identify patients at risk of clinical deterioration, as evidenced by its incorporation into the quick Sequential (Sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-and-initial-approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-undifferentiated-hypotension-and-shock/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oliguria</strong> &ndash; Oliguria in shock can be due to shunting of renal blood flow to other vital organs, direct injury to the kidney (eg, aminoglycoside toxicity), or due to intravascular volume depletion (eg, from vomiting, diarrhea, or hemorrhage).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mental status changes</strong> &ndash; Altered sensorium in shock is usually due to poor perfusion or metabolic encephalopathy. It is a continuum that begins with agitation, progresses to confusion or delirium, and ends in obtundation or coma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cool skin</strong> &ndash; Cool, clammy skin is due to compensatory peripheral vasoconstriction that redirects blood centrally, to maintain vital organ perfusion (ie, coronary, cerebral, and splanchnic flow). A cyanotic, mottled appearance is a late and worrisome feature of shock. However, the appearance of cool, clammy or cyanotic skin may also be due to, or exacerbated by, ischemia from underlying peripheral arterial vascular disease. Importantly, warm, hyperemic skin does not ensure the absence of shock because such an appearance may be present in patients with early distributive shock (prior to the onset of compensatory vasoconstriction) or terminal shock (due to failure of compensatory vasoconstriction).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Metabolic acidosis</strong> &ndash; In general, the demonstration of a high anion gap metabolic acidosis should always raise the clinical suspicion for the presence of shock. Importantly, the presence of a metabolic acidosis in states of shock is not specific and can also be due to acute kidney injury or toxin ingestion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and mixed acid-base disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hyperlactatemia</strong> &ndash; Either in conjunction with metabolic acidosis or not, the presence of an elevated serum lactate level has been associated with adverse outcomes, including the development of shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-and-initial-approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-undifferentiated-hypotension-and-shock/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The relationship between hyperlactatemia and mortality has been reproduced across a number of clinical conditions, including trauma, sepsis, and post-cardiac arrest. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102601471\"><span class=\"h3\">Features due to the underlying cause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the wide range of etiologies for shock, the presenting features can be variable and frequently overlap. However, they facilitate the early identification of the etiology of shock as well as organ failure due to shock, details of which are provided in the sections below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History and examination<strong> </strong>(see <a href=\"#H87905815\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory tests<strong> </strong>(see <a href=\"#H87903854\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging (see <a href=\"#H87903872\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87903521\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial approach to patients with undifferentiated <span class=\"nowrap\">hypotension/shock</span> is shown in the algorithms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F99357%7EPULM%2F100420\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef99357 graphicRef100420 \">algorithm 1A-B</a>). When feasible, a multidisciplinary, team-based approach is preferred because it allows the simultaneous evaluation and administration of therapy to patients with hypotension and shock. In brief:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The airway should be stabilized and adequate intravenous access secured so that patients can be immediately treated with intravenous fluids to restore adequate tissue perfusion. Importantly, resuscitative efforts, particularly intravenous fluids, should <strong>not </strong>be delayed for a detailed clinical assessment, nor should clinicians be conservative in terms of fluid resuscitation to patients with heart failure or kidney injury as a rule. Related to the latter point, liberal fluid resuscitation appeared to be life-saving in septic patients with intermediate serum lactate levels, a benefit derived amongst these traditionally underresuscitated sepsis subgroups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-and-initial-approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-undifferentiated-hypotension-and-shock/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H87903533\" class=\"local\">'Initial diagnostic evaluation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H87905475\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic support'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Importantly, patients may become hemodynamically unstable during the evaluation and early treatment period, which may necessitate rapid redirection of the approach to the administration of lifesaving therapies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276734809\"><span class=\"h2\">Assess airway, breathing, circulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first priorities are to stabilize the airway and breathing with oxygen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mechanical ventilation, when necessary. Intravenous access should be secured so that patients can be immediately treated with intravenous fluids to restore adequate tissue perfusion.</p><p>Patients with respiratory distress <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> marked hemodynamic instability are typically intubated. The exception is those with suspected tension pneumothorax, where the prompt drainage of air from the pleural space may quickly reverse shock and avoid intubation (mechanical ventilation can worsen tension and precipitate cardiac arrest). Rapid sequence intubation, typically with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a> (0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenously) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> (1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenously), and a rapidly acting neuromuscular blocker, typically utilizing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenously) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rocuronium</a> (1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenously), is the preferred approach; agents that worsen hypotension (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>) should be avoided.

However, central venous access should be obtained in those in whom peripheral access cannot be obtained, in those who need infusions of large volumes of fluids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood products, or in those who need prolonged infusions of vasopressors. Central venous access may also be useful in patients who require frequent blood draws for laboratory studies and for hemodynamic monitoring (eg, central venous pressure, central venous oxyhemoglobin saturation). Importantly, the administration of resuscitative fluids and medications should <strong>not</strong> be delayed because central venous access is not available. Related, evidence suggests that the use of peripheral intravenous vasoactive medications can be used safely for hours to days, obviating the need for central venous catheterization in a number of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-and-initial-approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-undifferentiated-hypotension-and-shock/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H434525966\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk stratification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When patients present with undifferentiated hypotension or shock, the clinician should stratify the patient according to the severity of shock and the need for immediate or early intervention so that empiric lifesaving therapies can be administered promptly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F99357%7EPULM%2F100420\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef99357 graphicRef100420 \">algorithm 1A-B</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians should obtain a brief history and examination, together with bedside telemetry monitoring <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> electrocardiography [ECG], to assess whether an <strong>immediate or early</strong> <strong>lifesaving</strong> therapy is required. While a definitive diagnosis is preferred, many of these therapies are administered based upon a presumed diagnosis with or without preliminary test results. (See <a href=\"#H276733879\" class=\"local\">'Common conditions needing lifesaving interventions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with milder forms of <span class=\"nowrap\">shock/hypotension</span> or critically ill patients who have been stabilized should undergo a thorough diagnostic evaluation while resuscitation continues. Sufficient time is typically available in such patients to obtain laboratory studies and definitive imaging so that a diagnosis can be made and appropriate therapy administered. However, the evaluation remains time-sensitive, as patients in this category are at risk of becoming hemodynamically unstable, such that a rapid redirection of the diagnostic and therapeutic strategy may be necessary. (See <a href=\"#H87903533\" class=\"local\">'Initial diagnostic evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276733879\"><span class=\"h3\">Common conditions needing lifesaving interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial approach discussed below is often dependent upon a brief history obtained from prehospital providers, hospital staff, family members, and the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458581236\"><span class=\"h4\">Anaphylactic shock</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients strongly suspected of having anaphylactic shock (eg, hypotension, inspiratory stridor, oral and facial edema, hives, history of recent exposure to common allergens [eg, bee stings]) should receive intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>. Patients on mechanical ventilation may also have a sudden elevation in peak inspiratory pressures. The typical adult dose is 0.3 mg of 1:1000 epinephrine injected into the mid-outer thigh and repeated every 5 to 15 minutes as needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58346\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58346 \">table 2</a>). Other pharmacologic agents frequently administered following epinephrine include antihistamines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> 25 to 50 mg and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a> 50 mg intravenously), nebulized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> (2.5 mg in 3 mL of normal saline), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenously). Blood for total tryptase or histamine should be drawn prior to or shortly after treatment.

Patients on mechanical ventilation may also have a sudden elevation in plateau pressures. Patients strongly suspected to have a tension pneumothorax do not require a chest radiograph and should have an emergent tube thoracostomy (24 or 28 Fr, 36 Fr for trauma; fifth intercostal space, midaxillary line) or needle decompression using a 14 to 16 gauge intravenous catheter (second or third intercostal space, midclavicular line) followed by immediate tube thoracostomy; tube thoracostomy is indicated should decompression fail.</p><p>Ultrasound guidance is preferable for both diagnosis and tube placement. In addition, we prefer that drainage of a tension pneumothorax be performed before endotracheal intubation unless the patient is already intubated or is in cardiac arrest. For those on mechanical ventilation, positive pressure ventilation should be reduced. Radiographic confirmation of reexpansion should be performed after drainage (eg, ultrasonography, chest radiography).

The demonstration of an anechoic stripe and tamponade physiology on point-of-care (POC) ultrasonography or bedside echocardiography is preferred before pericardiocentesis. Ultrasonography also guides needle or catheter placement and examines the response to drainage of fluid from the pericardial sac. In rare cases, an emergency thoracotomy may be performed in those who are unresponsive to catheter drainage or in those who develop a cardiac arrest during resuscitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-pericardiocentesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency pericardiocentesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Emergency thoracotomy'</a>.)</p><p>Importantly, pericardiocentesis should not be attempted in patients with a pericardial effusion due to aortic dissection or myocardial rupture, as relief of cardiac tamponade may worsen bleeding.

Serum and urinary electrolytes including hypo- or hypernatremia, hypo- or hyperkalemia, low urinary sodium concentration, or fractional excretion of sodium &lt;1 percent may indicate hypovolemia.

A low white blood cell count and especially a bandemia are more worrisome for sepsis in the setting of undifferentiated shock. As an example, in one observational study of 145 patients admitted to the intensive care unit with undifferentiated shock, infection was significantly more common among those with a band count greater than 10 percent than among those with a lower band count (odds ratio [OR] 8.7, 95% CI 3.4-22.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-and-initial-approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-undifferentiated-hypotension-and-shock/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coagulation studies and D-dimer level</strong> &ndash; Elevations in the prothrombin time or international normalized ratio as well as activated partial thromboplastin time may suggest a cause for underlying hemorrhagic shock but are also frequently elevated in patients with sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome due to nonspecific activation of the coagulation cascade, and liver disease. Evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (elevated fibrin split products and D-dimer level with low fibrinogen level) can also be found in patients with severe shock. Elevated D-dimer levels are not specific for the diagnosis of PE but, when normal, can significantly reduce the probability of PE.

Alternatively, a VBG may be obtained in any patient presenting with unstable blood pressure and concern for shock. The advantage of a VBG is that it can be obtained when the initial labs are drawn and will rapidly provide extensive data on the patient&rsquo;s pH, CO<sub>2</sub>, bicarbonate, base deficit, and serum lactate, particularly when obtaining an ABG is delayed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hypoxemia can be due to obstructive shock from pulmonary embolism, cardiogenic shock from myocardial infarction, septic shock from pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) resulting from shock. Compensatory hypocapnia can be seen in those with a metabolic acidosis. Hypercapnia may occur in patients with encephalopathy, brain injury, or increased dead space ventilation in patients with severe ARDS. Metabolic acidosis may be due to hyperlactatemia, acute kidney injury, or toxin ingestion. Additionally, a respiratory acidosis may occur in those obtunded from end-stage shock.

As examples, a toxicology screen may be useful in those suspected of having shock from drug intoxication, a type and crossmatch should be obtained in those with hemorrhage, and an amylase and lipase should be obtained in those with suspected pancreatitis. Urinalysis and gram stain of material from sites of possible infection (eg, blood, sputum, urine, wounds) or known organisms from prior cultures (eg, <em>Pseudomonas</em> in urine, clostridium difficile in stool) may provide a supportive clue to a possible source of sepsis. Tryptase and histamine levels are useful in those with suspected anaphylaxis. Urine electrolytes (sodium and creatine) should be obtained in those with hypovolemia. A peripheral smear may be useful in those suspected of having malaria, and fibrinogen levels and fibrin degradation products may be useful in those thought to have disseminated intravascular coagulation. A cortisol level or corticotrophin stimulation test may be helpful in those suspected to have an adrenal crisis, and thyroid function tests may identify those with suspected myxedema coma.

Its major advantage is the <strong>rapid </strong>examination of multiple organs, particularly the heart, to narrow the differential diagnosis and identify a potential etiology for shock. This feature is particularly valuable for patients in whom routine imaging is unsafe. Observational studies report that empiric diagnoses can be obtained within minutes when compared with standard imaging modalities. As an example, several studies have shown ultrasonography is more sensitive than portable chest radiography for the detection of pneumothorax, with sensitivity and specificity ranging from 86 to 100 and 92 to 100 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-and-initial-approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-undifferentiated-hypotension-and-shock/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. The same studies also show reduced time spent obtaining imaging with ultrasonography (2 to 3 versus 20 to 30 minutes). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thoracic-ultrasound-indications-advantages-and-technique\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thoracic ultrasound: Indications, advantages, and technique&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional advantages include the targeted application of lifesaving therapies (eg, pericardial drainage, chest tube insertion, thrombolytic therapy, peritoneal drainage, or lavage), and the safe performance of vascular access procedures (eg, central venous catheter insertion). Serial imaging can also follow the therapeutic response to interventions (eg, improved ventricle contractility following pericardiocentesis) and detect procedural complications (eg, ventricle perforation following pacemaker placement, pneumothorax following central venous catheter placement).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disadvantages</strong> &ndash; When compared with definitive imaging modalities performed by fully-trained providers, the major disadvantage of POC ultrasonography is its limited sensitivity for many of the etiologies associated with shock. Limited sensitivity may be partially explained by the lack of standards regarding the training, performance, and indications for bedside ultrasonography.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As an example, while POC ultrasonography is sensitive and specific for the detection of pericardial effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-and-initial-approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-undifferentiated-hypotension-and-shock/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>], comprehensive echocardiography with additional views may be required for definitive diagnosis of tamponade, particularly when effusions are complex, loculated, or small. Additionally, regional wall motion abnormalities, valvular dysfunction, ventricular septal wall perforation, ruptured aortic aneurysms, and aortic dissection cannot be readily detected using limited bedside views.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The advantages and disadvantages of FAST in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma (eg, poor sensitivity for distinguishing blood from other body fluids) are discussed separately.

While the optimal end-organ perfusion pressure is unclear, in general, we suggest maintaining the mean arterial pressure greater than 65 to 70 mmHg, since higher targets (eg, &gt;70 mmHg) do not appear to be associated with a mortality benefit and may be associated with increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-and-initial-approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-undifferentiated-hypotension-and-shock/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Features that are highly suspicious for shock include hypotension; oliguria; abnormal mental status; tachypnea; cool, clammy skin; and metabolic acidosis (usually hyperlactatemia). Most clinical features are neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of shock and are primarily used to narrow the differential diagnosis so that empiric therapies can be administered in a timely fashion.

While the optimal end-organ perfusion pressure is unclear, in general, we suggest maintaining the mean arterial pressure greater than 65 to 70 mmHg since higher targets may be associated with harm.
