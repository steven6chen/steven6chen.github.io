The most common tests used in clinical practice include the serum aminotransferases, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time. These tests are often referred to as &quot;liver function tests,&quot; although this term is somewhat misleading since most do not accurately reflect how well the liver is functioning, and abnormal values can be caused by diseases unrelated to the liver. In addition, these tests may be normal in patients who have advanced liver disease.</p><p>Several specialized tests have also been developed (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indocyanine green</a> clearance), which, although uncommonly used in clinical practice, can measure specific aspects of hepatic function.</p><p>Despite their limitations, liver biochemical and function tests have many applications in clinical medicine:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They provide a noninvasive method to screen for the presence of liver disease. The serum aminotransferases, for example, used to be part of panel of tests used to screen all blood donors in the United States for the presence of transmissible viruses before specific viral tests became available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They can be used to measure the efficacy of treatments for liver disease (such as immunosuppressant agents for autoimmune hepatitis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They can be used to monitor the progression of a disease such as viral or alcoholic hepatitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They can reflect the severity of liver disease, particularly in patients who have cirrhosis. As an example, the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score, which incorporates the prothrombin time and serum bilirubin and albumin concentrations, can predict survival (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p>The pattern of abnormalities on these tests is more accurate than any of the individual tests. Elevation of serum aminotransferases indicates hepatocellular injury, while elevation of the serum alkaline phosphatase indicates cholestasis. Recognition of patterns that are consistent with specific diseases can prompt appropriate additional testing.</p><p>The liver biochemical and function tests that are used commonly in clinical practice and that are used occasionally for specific circumstances can be categorized as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests that detect injury to hepatocytes &ndash; Most of these tests measure the activity of hepatic enzymes, such as the aminotransferases, in the circulation. These enzymes are normally intracellular but are released when hepatocytes are injured. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-biochemical-tests-that-detect-injury-to-hepatocytes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver biochemical tests that detect injury to hepatocytes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests of the liver's capacity to transport organic anions and metabolize drugs &ndash; These tests measure the liver's ability to clear endogenous or exogenous substances from the circulation. The best studied include serum measurements of bilirubin, bile acids, caffeine, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> metabolites, a variety of breath tests, and clearance tests such as bromsulphthalein (BSP) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indocyanine green</a> (ICG).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests of the liver's biosynthetic capacity &ndash; The most commonly performed tests to assess the biosynthetic capacity of the liver are the serum albumin and the prothrombin time (which requires the presence of clotting factors produced in the liver). Other tests that have been used are the serum concentrations of lipoproteins, ceruloplasmin, ferritin, and alpha 1-antitrypsin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests that detect altered immunoregulation, or viral hepatitis &ndash; These tests include the immunoglobulins, hepatitis serologies, and specific autoantibodies. Most of these substances are proteins made by B lymphocytes, not by hepatocytes. However, some are quite specific for certain liver diseases, such as antimitochondrial antibodies in primary biliary cholangitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of primary biliary cholangitis (primary biliary cirrhosis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>This topic review will discuss tests of the liver's capacity to transport organic anions and to metabolize drugs, but will not discuss the serum bilirubin (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-aspects-of-serum-bilirubin-determination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical aspects of serum bilirubin determination&quot;</a>). Most of these tests are used rarely in clinical practice. The other categories of liver biochemical and function tests are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-biochemical-tests-that-detect-injury-to-hepatocytes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver biochemical tests that detect injury to hepatocytes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enzymatic measures of cholestasis (eg, alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DYE TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the serum bilirubin is an insensitive and nonspecific measure of hepatobiliary disease, several other tests of hepatic excretory capacity have been developed. These include dye tests, measurement of the serum bile acid concentration, breath tests, and caffeine clearance. Although these tests are more sensitive than the serum bilirubin, they are nonspecific, more difficult to perform, and rarely used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Bromsulphthalein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of bromsulphthalein (BSP, sulfobromophthalein sodium) for the assessment of liver function was first introduced in 1924 and continued to be used as an indicator of liver function until the 1970s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. BSP is soluble in water, binds rapidly to albumin and alpha-1-lipoprotein after intravenous injection, and is then avidly taken up by hepatocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Infusions of BSP have been used to quantify the liver's excretory capacity by measuring the hepatic uptake, storage, and maximal biliary excretion rate of BSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Similar information can be obtained by determining clearance after a standard intravenous injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>BSP is seldom used now, and has been withdrawn from commercial markets due in part to a decline in sales from fear about potentially fatal anaphylactic reactions after intravenous administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The test is still used occasionally in clinical investigations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Indocyanine green</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Indocyanine green</a> (ICG) is another dye that is cleared exclusively by the liver and has been used to evaluate liver function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The principle of ICG clearance is similar to that of BSP except that ICG has a higher hepatic extraction ratio than BSP and is bound to albumin and alpha-1-lipoprotein more avidly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. ICG has a few other advantages since it is not affected by fever and its clearance is normal in patients with the Dubin-Johnson syndrome and in neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>].</p><p>ICG can be measured directly by spectrophotometry. It can also be measured by dichromatic earlobe densitometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], but this method is not always reliable and the earlobe readings do not correlate closely with simultaneously obtained plasma values. An ICG meter with a finger tip optical sensor permits continuous measurement of serum ICG concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Pulse dye densitometry technology has further improved ICG monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>ICG clearance can be measured by giving single intravenous injections (ranging from 0.64 to 6.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg)</span> and determining a blood level 20 minutes later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Although these low doses are safe, they are well below the threshold needed to saturate the liver's excretory capacity for ICG, which is more than 72 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg</span>. As a result, they provide a less accurate measure of hepatic excretory function than BSP clearance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Use for estimating hepatic blood flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ICG provides a good estimate of hepatic blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Infusion of ICG at a rate below the liver's capacity to clear it leads to a steady state within one hour, at which time the clearance rate is equal to the infusion rate. Hepatic blood flow can be estimated by use of the Fick equation:</p><p> &#160;Estimated hepatic blood flow = R &divide; ([ICGa] - [ICGhv])</p><p>where R equals the hepatic removal rate of ICG, which equals the infusion rate at steady state, and ICGa and ICGhv equal the concentration of ICG in the hepatic artery and portal vein blood and in hepatic vein blood, respectively. ICGa is the same as the ICG concentration in peripheral venous blood since other organs do not clear ICG. It is impractical to obtain a direct measurement of ICGhv in most circumstances since it requires catheterization of the hepatic vein. Instead, the hepatic clearance rate is usually assumed to be 100 percent (because first-pass extraction of ICG by the liver is high), and therefore ICGhv is considered to be zero.</p><p>Although this method permits noninvasive testing, it underestimates hepatic blood flow because ICGhv is always more than zero when actually measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Despite this limitation, ICG infusion provides a good approximation of blood flow in healthy adults, but not in patients with cirrhosis who have a marked decrease in extraction of ICG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Use in liver transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A potential role for ICG elimination for optimizing use (estimating the optimal dose) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> after liver transplantation has been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In another report, the addition of ICG measurement to the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score improved the prediction of survival in patients with advanced cirrhosis compared with the standard MELD score or the MELD score combined with plasma sodium concentration (another measure proposed to increase accuracy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. With the availability of improved ICG monitoring , ICG clearance continues to be studied, particularly after liver transplantation and hepatic resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/10,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SERUM BILE ACID CONCENTRATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although sensitive tests to measure the serum bile acid concentration have been available for many years, their role in the evaluation of patients with suspected liver disease is not well established. Measurement of serum bile acids (cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids and their conjugates) may be helpful in patients with primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis and in women who are suspected of having intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in hepatocytes, conjugated to glycine or taurine, and then secreted into bile. Approximately 80 to 90 percent of the secreted pool of bile acids is stored in the gallbladder between meals. The remaining 10 to 20 percent is secreted continuously into the duodenum, which accounts for the bile acids normally present in serum after a long fast (concentration of approximately 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The gallbladder contracts and discharges its pool of bile acids into the duodenum during a meal. Bile acids move rapidly down the intestinal tract, where they are actively absorbed by carrier-mediated transport in the terminal ileum and carried back to the liver by way of the portal vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A small proportion of bile acids are absorbed throughout the whole intestine by nonionic passive diffusion, and some pass into the feces.</p><p>The net effect of this enterohepatic recirculation is that a larger quantity of bile acids reaches the liver after a meal, and since the proportion extracted by the liver is constant, there is a two to fivefold elevation in the serum bile acid concentration compared with fasting values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In healthy individuals, serum bile acids are derived entirely from intestinal input; none comes directly from the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>As a result of these processes, the serum bile acid concentration is affected by a number of factors including hepatic blood flow, hepatic uptake, secretion of bile acids, intestinal motility, and the intestinal microbiota [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-the-livers-capacity-to-transport-organic-anions-and-metabolize-drugs/abstract/19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22</a>].

Although the radioimmunoassays can be automated, a variety of individual radioimmunoassays that detect cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids and their conjugates would have to be used to measure the total concentration of bile acids in serum.

A substance known to be metabolized primarily in the liver is labeled with 14C or 13C and is given orally or parenterally.

The most common tests used in clinical practice include the serum aminotransferases, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time. These tests are often referred to as &quot;liver function tests,&quot; although this term is somewhat misleading since most do not accurately reflect how well the liver is functioning and abnormal values can be caused by diseases unrelated to the liver. In addition, these tests may be normal in patients who have advanced liver disease. Several specialized tests have also been developed (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indocyanine green</a> clearance), which, although uncommonly used in clinical practice, can measure specific aspects of hepatic function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because the serum bilirubin is an insensitive and nonspecific measure of hepatobiliary disease, several other tests of hepatic excretory capacity have been developed. These include dye tests, measurement of the serum bile acid concentration, breath tests, and caffeine clearance. Although these tests are more sensitive than the serum bilirubin, they are nonspecific, more difficult to perform, and rarely used. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Dye tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although sensitive tests to measure the serum bile acid concentration have been available for many years, their role in the evaluation of patients with suspected liver disease is not well established. Measurement of serum bile acids (cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids and their conjugates) may be helpful for early diagnosis in patients with primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis and in women who are suspected of having intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Serum bile acid concentration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breath tests were introduced as a practical means for evaluating hepatic functional reserve. Many breath tests are available, including 14C-aminopyrine, 4C- or 13C-galactose, 14C-phenacetin, and 14C-diazepam. Other tests, such as the clearance of galactose or caffeine or the formation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> metabolites, can provide similar information. Although breath tests have been available for a number of years in the United States, they are still used infrequently since they are less convenient to perform than a simple blood test. The equipment needed to perform these tests is not widely available.
