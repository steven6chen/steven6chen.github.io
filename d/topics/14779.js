In addition, randomized trials have shown that neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy (followed by bladder surgery) results in improved survival outcomes for some patients compared with primary surgery (and adjuvant treatment). </p><p>Beyond patients with a primary diagnosis of muscle-invasive bladder cancer, radical cystectomy also has a role in carefully selected patients with non-muscle invasive disease, as well as in patients with locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer who achieve a major clinical response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy.</p><p>The role of radical cystectomy as the initial treatment and its use in conjunction with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, along with the role of alternative surgical procedures, will be discussed here.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy results in a lower risk of recurrence and an improvement in overall survival compared with surgery alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant treatment options for muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy may not have been administered in patients referred for cystectomy for a variety of reasons, both patient- and clinician-driven. In some cases, patients may be recommended to undergo cystectomy without chemotherapy if they have important medical contraindications (such as poor renal function) or are felt to be too unhealthy or frail to receive it. In the absence of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the outcomes following radical cystectomy correlate with the extent of local invasion and with the presence or absence of lymph node involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110763\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110763 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. For patients who did receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the post-chemotherapy extent of residual local disease is also strongly associated with survival, with those patients achieving a complete pathological response (no residual tumor within the bladder and lymph nodes) having the most favorable prognosis. </p><p>Large cohort data show that in patients not treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 50 to 60 percent of patients with invasive bladder cancer (clinical stage T2 to T4a) have organ-confined disease without lymph node involvement (pathologic stage pTis to T2, pN0).

Long-term survival in this setting is approximately 45 to 55 percent of these patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 20 to 30 percent of patients, regional lymph node metastasis (pTany, pN1 to 3) is identified, and this is associated with a substantially poorer prognosis, with 25 to 35 percent of patients remaining disease-free.</p><p/><p>For patients who recur after definitive cystectomy, their prognosis is poor, with distant recurrence correlating with a poorer survival and subsequent chemotherapy associated with minor improvement in outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>For patients in whom neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not administered, consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy is reasonable based on risk of recurrence and prognosis.

In addition, preoperative RT increases the risk of operative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and makes the creation of an internal urinary reservoir using irradiated bowel more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H565148942\"><span class=\"h3\">Pelvic lymph node metastasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The external iliac, hypogastric, and obturator lymph nodes represent the primary lymphatic drainage sites for the bladder. Among patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer, lymph nodes in these regions may be enlarged due to metastasis or due to reactive changes from recent TUR of bladder tumor. Physicians should consider the size and number of enlarged lymph nodes, and the clinical context when estimating the probability of lymph node metastasis. </p><p>For patients with equivocal lymph node enlargement that is suspicious of metastatic disease, an image-guided percutaneous biopsy confirming the presence or absence of pelvic lymph node metastases may be indicated prior to therapy. When biopsy is not feasible, positron emission <span class=\"nowrap\">tomography/computed</span> tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET/CT)</span> may be useful, although there is the possibility of false-positive and false-negative results. Patients with biopsy-confirmed lymph node metastasis or bulky pelvic lymph nodes (15 to 20 mm or greater in transaxial diameter) that are highly suspicious of metastatic bladder cancer are treated with six cycles of chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Primary chemoradiation'</a> below.) </p><p>Patients with equivocal pelvic lymph node enlargement on preoperative imaging that is not suspicious for metastasis (lymph nodes in the true pelvis or common iliac regions 10mm or less in transaxial diameter) are typically recommended to undergo radical cystectomy combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy where indicated. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22067739\"><span class=\"h3\">Locally advanced bladder cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An estimated 10 to 20 percent of patients with invasive bladder cancer have locally advanced, inoperable tumors based upon involvement of pelvic sidewall or adjacent viscera (clinical stage T4B), or bulky nodal metastasis (clinical stage N1 to 3, typically lymph nodes &ge;10 mm in transaxial diameter). The standard treatment for these patients is induction chemotherapy with cisplatin-based multi-agent chemotherapy. Post-chemotherapy cystectomy may be an option for carefully selected patients following three to six cycles of induction chemotherapy, provided there is evidence of a major clinical response to chemotherapy. Although the precise characterization of a major clinical response has not been uniformly defined, reasonable criteria include patients who maintain a good performance status and:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are pT0 on repeat TUR</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are downstaged by two or more clinical stages</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Show a 50 percent or greater resolution without growth or new lesions at four weeks after the last cycle of treatment</p><p/><p>The role of salvage cystectomy in patients with a major response to chemotherapy was illustrated by a retrospective analysis of 203 patients treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Overall, 50 patients were operated on for suspected residual disease following chemotherapy. Of these, 30 underwent a complete resection of all residual disease, while 17 had no viable tumor at surgery. Three were unresectable and died of cancer. Of the 30 who underwent salvage cystectomy, 10 (33 percent) were alive at five years. This result was similar to the 46 patients who achieved a complete response to chemotherapy (either by clinical criteria or surgical confirmation), 41 percent of whom were alive at five years.</p><p>Patients who do not experience a major clinical response and those who progress on neoadjuvant chemotherapy have a poor prognosis, and we do not advocate cystectomy in these patients unless indicated for palliation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> local control. Patients with residual disease who do not undergo cystectomy have a median survival of one to two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. The management of these patients is similar to that of patients with metastatic bladder cancer.

In addition, the surgical procedure also takes into account the gender of the patient:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In males, radical cystectomy generally includes removal of the prostate, seminal vesicles, as well as the urinary bladder. This extensive resection can cause nerve damage, which can lead to erectile dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Nerve-sparing procedures'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In females, involvement of the female reproductive organs (ie, uterus, cervix, ovaries, and vagina) may be identified, though it is not common. Therefore, while removal of some or all of these organs may be necessary to achieve complete resection, preservation of some organs may be appropriate in selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p>The extent of pelvic lymph node dissection is defined anatomically and is measured by the anatomic boundaries of the known primary and secondary nodal drainage of the bladder. The total number of lymph nodes removed is often used as a surrogate for completeness of the lymphadenectomy; it is an important predictor of survival in those with both positive and negative lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/4,18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,18-21</a>]. However, many variables affect the number of nodes identified by the pathologist, and the anatomic extent and the completeness of the node dissection is an important surgical quality metric. The improved prognosis associated with increasing lymph node counts may be due to the resection of histopathologically occult nodal metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], or it may be a surrogate for the quality of surgery. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that an extended template dissection may be indicated at the time of radical cystectomy. All patients should undergo a bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy, which includes the external and internal iliac, and obturator nodes. The extended template includes the presacral and common iliac lymph nodes up to the aortic bifurcation, and may include removal of the retroperitoneal lymph node proximal to the aortic bifurcation to the level of the inferior mesenteric artery. The potential significance of the extended dissection was illustrated by a mapping study in which 290 patients had an extended lymphadenectomy with removal of all nodal regions distal to the aortic bifurcation and removal of retroperitoneal lymph nodes below the inferior mesenteric artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Positive lymph nodes were identified in 28 percent of cases, of which only 25 percent had positive nodes restricted to the standard template (which typically is limited to the distal common iliac, obturator, hypogastric, and external iliac nodes). However, 25 percent had involved nodes located outside, but not within, the standard template. Despite these findings, it is not clear whether it influences survival outcomes. </p><p>Preliminary results from a randomized trial conducted in Germany comparing an extended versus standard dissection were presented at the 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting. In this trial, 437 patients were randomly assigned to either a limited or extended lymph node dissection, and 373 were available for an intention to treat analysis. With a median follow-up of 33 months, there was a statistically nonsignificant trend toward improvement in the five-year relapse-free survival, the primary endpoint of the study, with the extended lymph node dissection (67.0 versus 61.5 percent). There were similar trends in cancer-specific survival and overall survival. In a post hoc unplanned analysis limited to patients with pathologic T2 disease, there was a statistically significant improvement in relapse-free survival with an extended lymph node dissection (85.0 versus 62.5 percent, 95% CI 0.39, 0.18-0.82).</p><p>The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) is conducting a similar <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01224665&amp;token=YbJELcAW9G3aZfZrjTwgllXLsXNNrpAr426VqXdy7dJ/YQp8xCJN4Pc/ByEB5QwXjZalcguV/6AfMF+5z/3R3Q==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2994\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">trial</a> (<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01224665&amp;token=YbJELcAW9G3aZfZrjTwgllXLsXNNrpAr426VqXdy7dJ/YQp8xCJN4Pc/ByEB5QwXjZalcguV/6AfMF+5z/3R3Q==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2994\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">SWOG 1011</a>) among patients undergoing open radical cystectomy to address this issue. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22068464\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinary diversion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Removal of the bladder requires that the urinary flow be redirected, which may result in either a non-continent or continent diversion. The choice of urinary diversion is based upon patient and surgeon preference, and may be influenced by the extent of cancer and other patient-related factors. Continent reservoirs (which are created from detubularized loops of intestine) have become a preferred urinary diversion procedure for many men and women undergoing radical cystectomy. In appropriately selected patients, the creation of an orthotopic neobladder permits the elimination of an external stoma and the preservation of body image without compromising cancer surgery. The patient needs to be fully educated about the necessary commitment to the rehabilitation process and needs to possess adequate manual dexterity to perform self-catheterization if that becomes necessary. These options and the issues involved in choosing an approach to urinary diversion for an individual patient are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary diversion and reconstruction following cystectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Nerve-sparing procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the risk of sexual health complications with pelvic surgery, nerve-sparing approaches have been developed for both men and women. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22068521\"><span class=\"h4\">Male patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In men, resection of the prostate and seminal vesicles in conjunction with cystectomy frequently results in damage to the neurovascular bundles, thus causing impotence. Men with good erectile function who desire to preserve their potency after radical cystectomy may be candidates for preservation of the cavernous nerves, similar to that performed during nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer#H683372924\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Nerve-sparing approach'</a>). Nerve-sparing cystectomy requires dissection close to the urinary bladder, exposing patients to the risks of positive soft tissue surgical margins. Thus, patient selection is critical when performing nerve-sparing cystectomy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contralateral, unilateral nerve-sparing may be an option in patients with invasive tumors at the posterior, lateral, or trigonal region. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral nerve-sparing may be reasonable in patients with non-muscle invasive disease or invasive tumors at the anterior wall or dome of the bladder.</p><p/><p>With careful patient selection, local recurrence following nerve-sparing cystectomy is reported in 3 to 5 percent of male patients, which is similar to that in comparable series of patients managed without nerve-sparing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/5,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,24,25</a>]. Erections sufficient for intercourse are reported in 31 to 50 percent of patients within one to two years after nerve-sparing cystectomy, although most patients require assistance with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vardenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vardenafil</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tadalafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tadalafil</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/24,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26,27</a>]. Although the data are limited, it does appear that nerve-sparing surgery increases the chances of maintaining potency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Although short-term functional and oncologic results have been encouraging following prostate-sparing surgical procedures, concerns persist regarding the oncologic efficacy of this approach based upon the substantial long-term risk of recurrent urothelial cancer within the prostatic urethra [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] as well as the risk of subsequently developing prostate adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. Therefore, this procedure should be restricted to highly selected patients, including men without involvement of the bladder neck or prostatic urethra, men with no associated T<sub>IS</sub>, and men with no evidence of prostate cancer.

However, the effectiveness of nerve-sparing surgery to maintain sexual health in women with bladder cancer is not established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Laparoscopic approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditionally, radical cystectomy has been performed with an open surgical approach.

However, limited data suggest there is no improvement in important postoperative outcomes compared with open cystectomy. A single-center randomized trial conducted at a high-volume center compared open versus robotic cystectomy in 118 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. The rates of grade 3 to 5 complications within the first 90 days were similar with both procedures (22 versus 21 percent, respectively).

The frequency of complications appears to be related to surgeon experience, hospital volume, age, and the presence of medical comorbidities. Patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer typically are older and frequently have substantial comorbidity. The median age in large series ranges from 63 to 67 years, with approximately 5 percent over 80 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

However, an important limitation to all bladder preservation strategies is the risk for recurrent cancers involving the bladder (and prostatic urethra in men). For patients with urothelial carcinoma, the entire urothelium (from the renal calyces to the urethra) is at risk of developing recurrent tumors throughout a patient&rsquo;s lifetime, referred to as the risk for field-change carcinogenesis. </p><p>The risk of new or recurrent carcinoma is highest at the retained bladder, with estimates of at least 50 percent or higher within three to five years of treatment among patients with muscle-invasive disease managed by a bladder-sparing approach. Over longer intervals (more than five years), these risks may be substantially higher. Given these future risks, patients should be cautioned about these potential risks with bladder preservation approaches, particularly if they have a long anticipated life expectancy on the basis of age and general health.</p><p>These options are available to patients who are older or have significant comorbid illnesses that make them less than ideal candidates for a radical cystectomy and for those who desire to preserve their bladders. For these patients, alternatives to radical cystectomy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radical transurethral resection (TUR).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial cystectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy (RT) techniques, including definitive external RT alone, an external beam RT combined with interstitial radiation implants (brachytherapy), and a combined modality approach using resection plus RT and concurrent chemotherapy.</p><p/><p>In general, bladder preservation approaches are considered by many to produce inferior oncologic outcomes compared with radical cystectomy, although this has not been proven in randomized trials.</p><p>Optimal candidates for these alternatives are those with solitary muscle-invasive tumors clinically confined to the bladder, no associated carcinoma in situ (T<sub>IS</sub>), and no evidence of hydronephrosis. For patients who meet these criteria, intermediate- and long-term cancer-specific survival rates approach those achieved with radical cystectomy, and 35 to 50 percent of patients will survive five years with an intact bladder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Radical transurethral resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optimal candidates for radical TUR are those with solitary tumors at the trigone, posterior, or lateral walls with focal invasion into muscularis propria. Patients should have no evidence of residual cancer on repeat TUR and should not have any evidence of associated T<sub>IS</sub> or prostatic urethral involvement.</p><p>The role of definitive TUR was illustrated by a retrospective series of 432 patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer who had been referred for definitive management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Of the 151 patients who had either no evidence of cancer (T0) or only T1 tumors following restaging TUR, 99 were treated by TUR alone, and 52 underwent radical cystectomy. Of those treated by TUR alone, the 10-year cancer-specific survival was 76 percent, and 57 percent survived with their bladders intact. These results are similar to the 71 percent 10-year cancer-specific survival in the 52 patients who were T0 to T1 on restaging TUR who underwent immediate cystectomy. Similar results were observed in another series of 133 patients who were rendered tumor-free after TUR of muscle-invasive bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]; the cancer-specific survival and progression-free survival with bladder preservation were 77 and 58 percent, respectively, at 15 years.</p><p>However, radical TUR is applicable to only a small minority of patients with muscle-invasive disease. In a series of 327 patients treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center from 1997 to 2002, only 35 (11 percent) were considered eligible for TUR followed by surveillance, and only 27 of these actually opted for management with this approach rather than immediate cystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>Intensive, long-term cystoscopic follow-up in these patients is mandatory because of the risk of recurrent bladder tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Partial cystectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Partial cystectomy is an option for carefully selected patients. Such patients should have a solitary muscle-invasive tumor that is located anteriorly, at the bladder dome, or within a bladder diverticulum in which a 2 cm margin of normal, non-distended bladder can be removed around the base of the lesion. The presence of multifocal tumors, associated T<sub>IS</sub>, prostatic urethral involvement, or a prior history of recurrent bladder or upper tract urothelial tumors are contraindications to partial cystectomy.</p><p>Partial cystectomy allows complete pathologic staging of the primary tumor, and a standard or extended pelvic lymph node dissection to be performed while preserving urinary and sexual function, and avoiding the need for urinary diversion. Patients undergoing partial cystectomy may be recommended to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy. Similar to radical cystectomy, partial cystectomy may be performed through an open or minimally-invasive approach (laparoscopic or robotic).</p><p>The disadvantages of partial cystectomy are the potential for significant blood loss; the risk of tumor recurrence in the midline scar or abdominal cavity from tumor spillage, given that the bladder is opened during the procedure (unlike radical cystectomy); and the risk of recurrent tumor in the residual bladder.</p><p>Long-term survival after partial cystectomy is reported in approximately 70 percent of patients, and 53 to 75 percent enjoyed long-term survival with their bladders intact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/67-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-70</a>]. However, it is important to recognize the extreme selection bias in these series relative to cohorts undergoing cystectomy or chemoradiation.</p><p>Although favorable outcomes have been reported in these series, strict adherence to selection criteria is mandatory to avoid a much worse long-term outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both external beam RT and brachytherapy have been used for the treatment of bladder cancer, although in highly selected populations. The outcomes from these treatment modalities are summarized below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">External beam RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Definitive external beam RT is often recommended for frail, older patients or those who are medically unfit for other approaches in an effort to palliate local symptoms. Local recurrence after RT alone (without concurrent cytotoxic treatment) is reported in up to 70 percent of patients, and five-year survival ranges from 20 to 40 percent. Thus, definitive external beam RT is not considered an acceptable alternative to radical cystectomy in otherwise healthy patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Brachytherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with a small (&lt;5 cm) solitary muscle-invasive bladder tumor, brachytherapy has been combined with external beam RT to provide a radiation boost to the primary tumor. In this highly selected population, outcomes appear to be similar to those reported with radical cystectomy, although this has not been demonstrated in randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>]. Given the paucity of data, the use of brachytherapy should not be routinely offered to patients outside of select centers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary chemoradiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combined treatment that utilizes chemotherapy administered concomitantly with RT is recommended for patients who are otherwise candidates for bladder preservation, which includes patients who may not be optimal candidates for surgery. The administration of radiosensitizing chemotherapy using single-agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> or a combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a> C has been demonstrated to improve local control of RT compared with RT alone, without significant increased risks of long-term toxicity. Further discussion regarding chemoradiation is covered in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bladder preservation treatment options for muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTTREATMENT MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have undergone definitive therapy for bladder cancer are at risk for the development of distant metastases as well as urothelial recurrence in the renal pelvis, ureters, or urethra. The risk of developing disseminated metastases is highest in the first few years after treatment. Therefore, follow-up should include surveillance imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and urine cytology (including urethral wash cytology for those with a retained urethra after radical cystectomy) for evidence of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>]. The frequency of imaging should take into account the individual risk of recurrence, but in general, it should be performed every three to six months for the first two years, then as clinically indicated, which is consistent with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. However, whether or not early detection of disseminated disease improves survival remains uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Patients who undergo bladder-sparing treatments should also undergo routine endoscopic surveillance of the bladder and urethra as the risk of local recurrence may be 50 percent or higher.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H439094\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF RECURRENT DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bladder cancer is associated with a field defect of the urinary mucosa, with the result that the entire lining of the urinary tract may be at risk for developing malignancy. For patients with recurrent high-grade <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> invasive tumors after bladder-sparing therapy, salvage radical cystectomy is generally the preferred treatment. Radical cystectomy in this setting is associated with overall survival rates of 40 to 50 percent, which probably represents a 10 to 20 percent reduction in survival compared with management with immediate radical cystectomy.
