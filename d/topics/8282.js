These problems make it hard to work or do other daily activities. People who have a virus called &quot;HIV&quot; can sometimes get dementia. When doctors do not find any other cause for dementia in people with HIV, it is called &quot;HIV-associated dementia.&quot;</p><p>HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. It attacks the body's infection-fighting system, called the &quot;immune system.&quot; It can cause many different problems, including dementia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12541575\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of HIV-associated dementia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of HIV-associated dementia can start very mild and get worse slowly. Early symptoms can include mild problems with reading, understanding or remembering things, or doing simple math.</p><p>More severe symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thinking or understanding things more slowly than before</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Walking or moving more slowly than before</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Worse memory problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems speaking</p><p/><p>People who have HIV-associated dementia might also have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble walking steadily or keeping their balance</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leg weakness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shaking (doctors call this &quot;tremor&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less energy than usual &ndash; A person who has HIV-associated dementia might not be as interested in doing things as before.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of interest in sex</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less emotion than usual &ndash; A person who has HIV-associated dementia might not care about things or show emotion like he or she used to.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12541590\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. See a doctor or nurse if you think you or someone close to you might have HIV-associated dementia. The symptoms are sometimes caused by other medical conditions that doctors can treat. Doctors can also give you advice or medicines to help with symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12541605\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for HIV-associated dementia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No, there is no one test. The doctor or nurse can do an exam, ask questions, and decide which tests are best for your individual situation.</p><p>If a person with HIV has symptoms of dementia, doctors might do a CT scan or MRI of the brain. These are imaging tests that create pictures of the inside of the brain. They can help doctors tell if symptoms are caused by HIV or a different condition. Another possible test is called a lumbar puncture (also called a &quot;spinal tap&quot;). In this procedure, a doctor puts a thin needle into a person's lower back and takes out a small amount of spinal fluid. Lab tests of the fluid can tell the doctor more about what might be causing dementia symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12541620\"><span class=\"h1\">How is HIV-associated dementia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main treatment is a group of medicines to treat the HIV. Doctors call these medicines &quot;antiretroviral medicines.&quot;</p><p>If you have HIV, you probably take antiretroviral medicines already. Your doctor might give you different medicines if you start to get dementia. He or she will do regular exams, talk to you about your condition, and do tests to see how you are doing.</p><p>People who have HIV-associated dementia sometimes also get depressed. Doctors can give medicines to treat the depression. If you take these medicines, the doctor or nurse will check often to make sure they are working correctly and not making you feel sick.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12541643\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dementia-including-alzheimer-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dementia (including Alzheimer disease) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-memory-and-thinking-problems-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Evaluating memory and thinking problems (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-aids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: HIV/AIDS (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dementia-including-alzheimer-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dementia (including Alzheimer disease) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
