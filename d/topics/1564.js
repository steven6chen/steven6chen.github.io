Although they have a greater need for specialized health care than other children (with and without disabilities) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-overview-of-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], they and their families have difficulty accessing appropriate care in medical settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-overview-of-management/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. They are also more likely than other children with special health care needs (CSHCN), to have delayed or foregone care, receive care that is not family-centered, and have unmet needs for specific health care and family support services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-overview-of-management/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

In the National Survey of CSHCN (2005-2006), families of children with ASD were more likely than those of other CSHCN to report financial problems, need additional income for the child's medical care, and reduce or stop work in order to care for their child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-overview-of-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Family support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a child is diagnosed with ASD, the primary care provider plays a critical role in supporting the family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-overview-of-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

In many of these studies, social functioning continued to be a concern. In a nationally representative sample of adolescents and young adults with ASD, social isolation was common (55 percent had not gotten together with friends in the previous year; 64 percent had not received any phone calls from friends in the previous year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-overview-of-management/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

In a 2007-2008 population-based survey of parents, guardians, and young adults with ASD (age 19 to 23 years), 9 percent had attended a vocational or technical education program, 35 percent had attended college (two- or four-year), and 55 percent had paid employment during the first six months after high school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-overview-of-management/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Participation in postsecondary education or employment increased with the number of years out of high school (48 percent at one to two years, 89 percent at four or more years) and was associated with higher functional ability and higher parent or guardian household income.</p><p>Employment did not necessarily equate with independence, which was affected by multiple factors. In another long-term study of adults with varying levels of cognitive function, only 12 percent achieved a high level of independence, and overall outcome was variable, even in those with IQ &gt;70 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-overview-of-management/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of treatment are to maximize functioning, move the child toward independence, and improve the quality of life. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Goals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although there is no cure for ASD, early diagnosis and early intensive treatment have the potential to affect outcome. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Early intervention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of ASD focuses on behavioral and educational interventions that target the core symptoms. Pharmacologic interventions may be used as an adjunct to address medical or psychiatric comorbidities. Treatment programs should be monitored to ensure appropriate response to therapy; the program should be modified as the child's needs change. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Treatment modalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary care provider should provide ongoing evaluation of the child's progress, provide ongoing family education and support, screen for coexisting medical conditions, and direct families to appropriate specialty providers as needed. Close follow-up by the primary care provider is particularly important because children with ASD have decreased access to care for various reasons.
