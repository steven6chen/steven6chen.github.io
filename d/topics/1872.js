Approximately 90 percent of all adults in the world consume caffeine daily. In their natural forms, coffee and tea contain several chemical components that may confer both beneficial and adverse health effects, including caffeine and antioxidants (eg, polyphenols, catechins, and flavonoids).</p><p>Most of the data on the health benefits and risks of caffeine are from observational studies in which self-reported consumption of beverages and foods are associated with health outcomes. Such studies make it difficult to identify caffeine itself as the causative agent and to exclude residual confounding. Based on available data, there is insufficient evidence for promoting or discouraging regular coffee <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tea consumption. Caffeine has multiple systemic effects on the neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular, endocrine, and gastrointestinal systems. The impact on health may be modified by genetic factors, age, sex, medications, and other environmental exposures.</p><p>This review will focus on the effects of caffeine and caffeinated beverages on specific disease processes, including insulin resistance, cancer, and all-cause mortality. The specific effects of caffeine on the cardiovascular system, as well as the effects of caffeine on pregnancy, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular effects of caffeine and caffeinated beverages&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CONSUMPTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H189169654\"><span class=\"h2\">Safe levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most adults, consumption of up to 400 mg of caffeine a day appears to be safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A list of commonly consumed caffeinated beverages and average caffeine content is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79304 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Limited data are available about safe levels of caffeine consumption in children and adolescents. A systematic review found that intake of 2.5 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">caffeine/kg</span> of body weight per day is not associated with adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Young adults need to be cautioned about using caffeinated energy drinks in excess and not mixing them with other substances. (See <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Dependence and abuse'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27494889\"><span class=\"h2\">Coffee and tea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More than 150 million people in the United States drink coffee on a daily basis, making it an important environmental exposure. Coffee is preferred over tea in the developed countries, particularly in Europe (except in England and Ireland), Australia, and the Americas. The developed world accounts for 71.5 percent of worldwide coffee consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The average US adult's coffee consumption is about two cups per day, which is the equivalent of approximately 280 mg of caffeine, although coffee varies greatly in caffeine content (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79304 \">table 1</a>). Individuals who consume four or more cups of coffee daily are considered by some investigators to be heavy coffee users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Coffee consumption is higher in men than women and in smokers than nonsmokers, but lower in the black than in the white population in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Tea consumption in the United States is increasing and varies greatly by type of tea. In the United States, 87 percent of total tea consumption is black tea and 12.5 percent is green tea, with the remainder coming from oolong and herbal teas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Tea is preferred over coffee in Asia and in the Southern Cone (Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay), accounting for 76.6 percent of worldwide tea consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Tea is second only to water in worldwide beverage consumption, with the overall quantity of tea consumed being three times greater than coffee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The range of caffeine in tea varies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79304 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Coffee and black tea are often consumed with cream, sugar, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> milk. Non-dairy creamers often contain partially hydrogenated oils and, when used in large amounts, could be a significant dietary source of trans-fatty acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Added sugar may contribute to the dietary glycemic load and thus negate some of the potential benefits of caffeinated beverages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Sugar and nondairy creamer may also reduce the antioxidant concentrations of these beverages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There are no reports, however, on whether milk or other additives alter the effects of coffee or tea on disease endpoints.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27494901\"><span class=\"h2\">Soft drinks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caffeinated soft drinks are another significant source of caffeine intake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79304 \">table 1</a>), particularly in children. Consumption of caffeinated energy drinks and reports of caffeine toxicity from abusing energy drinks, especially in the adolescent population, have increased from 2004 to 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Hundreds of different brands of caffeinated beverages exist, with caffeine content varying from 50 mg to over 500 mg per can or bottle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Case studies of serious adverse events in adults (eg, atrial fibrillation and seizures) from caffeinated energy drinks involved total doses of more than 480 mg of caffeine daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27494979\"><span class=\"h2\">Other forms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caffeine is also available as an over-the-counter drug and is frequently added to certain types of dietary supplements. Powdered caffeine is 100 percent caffeine and can lead to accidental overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Caffeine can also be found in chocolate and coffee-flavored ice cream (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79304 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ACTIVE COMPONENTS AND METABOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caffeine is rapidly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and undergoes demethylation in the liver via the enzyme cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Defects in the CYP1A2 enzyme are associated with impaired caffeine metabolism and prolonged caffeine half-life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Genetic polymorphisms in the CYP1A2 pathway may in part explain inconsistencies in studies of coffee and its effects on health.</p><p>Caffeine is a potent antagonist of central and peripheral nervous system adenosine receptors, thereby stimulating the release of excitatory neurotransmitters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The behavioral effects of caffeine are attributed to its effects on adenosine receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In addition to caffeine, other compounds in coffee and tea have pharmacologic effects. Recognized components include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chlorogenic acid, found in both coffee and black tea, raises homocysteine concentrations in plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In addition, polyphenols in coffee such as caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid inhibit DNA methylation in a dose-dependent manner, which prevents downregulation of tumor suppressor proteins and DNA repair enzymes involved in carcinogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diterpenoids in unfiltered coffee may raise plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Induction of detoxifying enzymes (eg, glutathione S-transferase) that protect against oxidative insults has been identified in vitro studies with rat liver cells exposed to coffee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unidentified compounds in coffee, other than caffeine, activate the sympathetic system and may increase blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Antioxidants do pass through coffee filters.</p><p/><p>Although there are data showing that intake of coffee or its constituent products interferes with absorption and metabolism of dietary and pharmacologic products, the available evidence is largely from small studies and is inconclusive. However, coffee intake has a consistent effect of decreasing the absorption of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>] and iron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caffeine's physiological and behavioral effects are dose-dependent, and research on caffeine must be interpreted with this in mind. In addition, epidemiological studies of caffeine may be confounded by several variables: healthy individuals are more likely to use caffeine than unhealthy persons, and caffeine use is highly correlated with tobacco use, so tobacco use should be carefully controlled and measured in both epidemiological and experimental studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive/neuropsychiatric</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caffeine has been shown to influence cognition and mood, both acutely and chronically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Its effects, however, vary depending on the study population and the amount and duration of caffeine consumed. In rested individuals, caffeine in low and moderate doses, approximately 30 to 300 mg, improves vigilance and reaction time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-36</a>]. In sleep-deprived individuals, caffeine&rsquo;s positive effects generalize to a wide variety of functions, including learning and decision-making and real world activities such as automobile and aircraft operation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/19,37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,37-40</a>]. Individuals who are habitual consumers of coffee and tea perform better on various tests of cognitive performance, such as reaction time and visuospatial reasoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Alertness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caffeine consumption leads to increased alertness, mental energy, and ability to concentrate, particularly when subjects are fatigued or working at night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. This is probably the fundamental reason why so many humans regularly consume caffeine. Caffeine mitigates the adverse effects of sleep deprivation on a wide variety of cognitive functions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/19,35,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,35,44,45</a>]. A systematic review of 13 randomized trials of persons with jet lag or shift work disorder found that caffeine significantly improved concept formation, reasoning, memory, orientation, attention, and perception when compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Caffeine was also found to be better than placebo in preventing errors and was similarly effective in comparison to other active interventions such as using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a> or bright light.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caffeine has significant pharmacologic properties that can alleviate or generate headache symptoms. Caffeine has long been used for its analgesic properties in the treatment of headache and is frequently used alone or in combination with other medications. Randomized trials have found that combination medications that include caffeine (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, and caffeine) are more effective for tension and migraine headaches than acetaminophen or low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p>Habitual caffeine consumption is associated with chronic migraine and analgesic rebound headache. In a case-control study, patients with daily caffeine consumption were more likely to have chronic migraines (odds ratio [OR] 2.9, 95% CI 1.5-5.3) and analgesic rebound headaches (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-3.9) than patients who did not regularly consume caffeine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

A meta-analysis found evidence of a dose-response relationship between coffee or tea intake and decreased risk for Parkinson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The mechanism of how caffeine might protect against Parkinson disease is not known.</p><p>This apparent protective effect is not observed in women who are taking postmenopausal hormone therapy, in whom caffeine seems to increase the risk for Parkinson disease, suggesting interactions between coffee and hormone use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. Among postmenopausal hormone users in the Nurses' Health Study, high intake of coffee (&ge;6 cups) was associated with a fourfold increased risk of Parkinson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Alzheimer disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are very few studies examining the relationship between coffee and Alzheimer disease. In a pooled analysis of two cohort and two case control studies on coffee and Alzheimer disease, coffee consumption was associated with a small protective effect against Alzheimer disease (relative risk [RR] 0.70, 95% CI 0.55-0.90) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. These findings are supported by data from Alzheimer transgenic mice in which supplementation with caffeine was associated with lower or delayed risk of Alzheimer disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychiatric</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caffeine intake is associated with a wide range of psychiatric symptoms and disorders, but there is no evidence of causality. Acute caffeine intake is associated with anxiety, nervousness, insomnia, irritability, and even panic attacks in healthy volunteers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Patients with preexisting anxiety disorders may be more susceptible to the anxiogenic effects of caffeine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In one US study of over 3600 adult twins, caffeine intake was associated with increased prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder, depression, panic disorder, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse, particularly for those with heavy caffeine intake (&gt;5 cups of coffee per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. After controlling for genetic and environmental factors, the association between psychiatric disorders and caffeine was nonsignificant. By contrast, a prospective cohort study of &gt;50,000 women free of depressive symptoms found that increasing caffeinated coffee consumption was associated with a decreased risk of incident depression in a dose-dependent fashion (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.95, &ge;4 compared with &le;1 cup per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

This would be consistent with the finding that individuals homozygous for the variant allele (T) in the adenosine receptor A2A gene are less likely to consume large amounts of coffee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>].</p><p>Heavy caffeine use is associated with increased risk for other addictive behaviors, including tobacco and alcohol abuse, as illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The proportion of current smokers is significantly higher (43 versus 12 percent) among Costa Ricans who consumed four or more cups of coffee per day compared with less than one cup per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Findings were similar for a prospective Finnish study, in which the proportion of smokers was higher (30 versus 3 percent) for people who consumed more than seven cups of coffee daily, compared with those who drank one to two cups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Nurses&rsquo; Health Study, alcohol consumption was 50 percent higher among women who drank six or more cups per day compared with those who consumed less than one cup per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. In the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, alcohol consumption was doubled among men who drank six or more cups per day compared with those who consumed less than one cup per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a survey of high school students in Italy, caffeine use was associated with alcohol use, gambling, internet addiction, and illicit substance abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In young adults, caffeinated energy drinks are sometimes mixed with alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], perhaps due in part to the belief that caffeine counteracts alcohol&rsquo;s sedative effects. However, this may be erroneous. For example, in one randomized trial of 127 adults (ages 21 to 30), adding caffeine to alcohol did not improve driving performance, measured by a driving simulator and performance of sustained <span class=\"nowrap\">attention/reaction</span> times on the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/148\" class=\"abstract_t\">148</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h2\">Caffeine withdrawal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there has been some question raised about the existence of a caffeine withdrawal syndrome based upon nonrandomized trials, subsequent randomized trials do support the existence of a caffeine withdrawal syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>]. A genetic propensity for caffeine withdrawal has been shown in studies comparing monozygotic and dizygotic twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>].</p><p>A comprehensive review of caffeine withdrawal validated ten symptom categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Tiredness/fatigue</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased <span class=\"nowrap\">energy/activeness</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased <span class=\"nowrap\">alertness/attentiveness</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Drowsiness/sleepiness</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased <span class=\"nowrap\">contentedness/wellbeing</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depressed mood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty concentrating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irritability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Fuzzy/foggy/not</span> clearheaded</p><p/><p>Flu-like symptoms, nausea and muscle pain may also be experienced. Headache is the most common symptom (50 percent incidence). Caffeine withdrawal can occur with abstinence from daily doses as low as 100 mg per day, but the incidence and severity of symptoms increases with higher daily dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>]. Withdrawal symptoms typically occur within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuing caffeine, peak at one to two days, and may persist for up to nine days. The minimum duration of caffeine maintenance leading to withdrawal symptoms is three days. Readministration of caffeine has been shown to rapidly reverse withdrawal symptoms within 30 to 60 minutes.</p><p>When caffeine abstinence in a chronic caffeine user is necessary (eg, prior to an elective medical procedure), we suggest a gradual reduction in caffeine intake over the week preceding the planned abstinence. However, in experimental studies, only 50 percent of individuals acutely abstaining from caffeine experience withdrawal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>]. Therefore, if an unplanned abstinence occurs (eg, in an emergent procedure), caffeine replacement is not indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caffeine is the most consumed stimulant in the world, usually in the form of coffee and tea. Based on available data, there is insufficient evidence for promoting or discouraging coffee <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tea consumption in the daily diet. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the majority of healthy adults, consuming less than 400 mg of caffeine a day appears to be safe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79304 \">table 1</a>). In children and adolescents, consumption of less than 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day appears to be safe. Individuals, especially adolescents, need to be cautioned about excessive caffeine intake and mixing caffeine with alcohol and other drugs. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Consumption'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consumption of caffeinated beverages is associated with some short-term benefits, including increased mental alertness; improvements in certain aspects of cognitive performance, especially vigilance and reaction time; and improved athletic performance. Caffeine, in moderate doses, mitigates many of the adverse effects of sleep deprivation and jet lag on cognitive performance and mental alertness. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Alertness'</a> above and <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Athletic performance enhancement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consumption of high levels of caffeine can be associated with short-term adverse effects, including headache, anxiety, tremors, and insomnia, depending on prior patterns of caffeine use. Chronic users are less sensitive to the adverse behavioral effects of caffeine than non-users. In the long term, caffeine is also associated with generalized anxiety disorder and substance abuse disorders, although causality has not been established. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive/neuropsychiatric'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Possible long-term benefits of caffeinated beverages are dose-dependent. Caffeine is associated with a reduced risk of Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, alcoholic cirrhosis, and gout. Both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee are also associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Specific physiologic effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although several studies have linked coffee consumption with increase or decrease in risk of various cancers, definitive data are lacking. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heavy coffee intake may trigger coronary and arrhythmic events in susceptible individuals, although coffee intake is not considered a long-term risk factor for myocardial disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular effects of caffeine and caffeinated beverages&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of studies show that there may be a modest inverse relationship between coffee consumption and all-cause mortality. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the existence of caffeine dependence and abuse are controversial, caffeine withdrawal is a well-documented clinical syndrome, with headache being the most common symptom. (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Caffeine dependence, abuse, and withdrawal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450491633\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The author and editorial staff at UpToDate, Inc. would like to thank Edmond Kabagambe, DVM, MS, PhD and Melissa Wellons, MD, MHS for their contributions to previous versions of this topic.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Heckman MA, Weil J, Gonzalez de Mejia E.
