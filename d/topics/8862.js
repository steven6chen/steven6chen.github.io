When disseminated BCG infection occurs, antituberculous therapy with or without glucocorticoids should be administered.</p><p>The infectious complications of BCG immunotherapy will be reviewed here. The clinical use of this agent for the treatment of non&ndash;muscle invasive bladder cancer and acute noninfectious complications of BCG are discussed separately. Disseminated infection has also been rarely reported in patients receiving BCG vaccination for the prevention of tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bcg-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;BCG vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism by which Bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) leads to the development of infectious complications is not fully understood. Its mechanism of action as an immunotherapeutic agent in cancer is not fully known, but evidence suggests that elaboration of a particular helper T cell cytokine profile known as the &quot;Th1 response&quot; is an integral part of its mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This potentially leads to alteration of <span class=\"nowrap\">suppresser/helper</span> T cell ratios. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer#H2174686094\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Mechanism of action of BCG'</a>.)</p><p>Considerable debate exists in the literature about whether complications associated with intravesical BCG represent a hypersensitivity reaction or ongoing active infection. The hypersensitivity hypothesis gained early credence based upon the presence of granulomas and the absence of recoverable organisms. In a number of case reports, acid-fast bacilli have not been demonstrated and organisms have not grown despite a high clinical suspicion of BCG infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. A response to glucocorticoids, administered along with antituberculous drugs, has also supported the notion of a hypersensitivity response.</p><p>By contrast, other case reports have demonstrated viable organisms in a variety of tissues, including lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], psoas abscess contents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], mycotic aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], vitreous fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], and even the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The fastidious growth nature of BCG in culture and a doubling time of 24 to 48 hours contribute to the difficulty in its isolation. <em>M. bovis</em> has also been demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], although in other reports these studies have been negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Further compounding this controversy are several cases of delayed infection, months to even years after the original BCG administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Both viewpoints about the pathogenesis of complications due to BCG have merit and both probably play a role in the manifestations of disseminated infection. Organisms are most likely to gain access to lymphatics and blood through disruption of uroepithelial cells and, as with other mycobacterial infections, disseminate to a variety of sites. Manifestations at these distant sites may reflect initial dissemination or even reactivation of infection following alteration in the immune status of the host, hypersensitivity responses, or a combination of both. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculosis: Natural history, microbiology, and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe adverse events due to local instillation of Bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) are uncommon. In a retrospective analysis of 2602 patients reported in 1989, the overall rate of serious complications was less than 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The most common complication was fever &gt;103&ordm;F in 2.9 percent followed in decreasing frequency by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant hematuria (1 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Granulomatous prostatitis (0.9 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumonitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hepatitis (0.7 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthralgia (0.5 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epididymitis (0.4 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sepsis (0.4 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rash (0.3 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ureteral obstruction (0.3 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contracted bladder (0.2 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal abscess (0.1 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytopenia (0.1 percent)</p><p/><p>No differences in the incidence of complications were observed comparing different BCG preparations or doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A Cochrane review identified six randomized trials of intravesical BCG including 585 patients; local complications included urinary frequency, cystitis, fever, and hematuria in 71, 67, 25, and 23 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. No cases of BCG sepsis or deaths occurred in this review.</p><p>There are conflicting data on the safety of steroids in patients treated with BCG. In one series of 24 patients who had concomitant treatment with steroids or were immunocompromised, the incidence of side effects was comparable with that of patients without evidence of immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. By contrast, a fatal case of BCG reactivation and sepsis three years after uneventful BCG treatment for bladder cancer was documented following several months of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Advanced age is also considered a risk factor. In one series of 58 patients, approximately one-half of those &ge;70 years of age developed complications from BCG treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Systemic sepsis and even death can also develop early following local instillation of BCG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. During the initial clinical experience with BCG as an intravesical agent, most cases of sepsis could be traced back to recognized errors in BCG administration such as traumatic catheterization, administration too early after transurethral surgery, or instillation during a concomitant urinary tract infection (UTI). All these conditions result in physical disruptions in the urothelial blood barrier. Nowadays, sepsis has been estimated to occur in approximately 1 in every 15,000 patients treated with intravesical BCG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The manifestations of serious BCG infection, however, appear to be changing as precautions to avoid mucosal disruption are more widely respected. In the most comprehensive single-institution series and the accompanying literature review, 11 BCG infectious complications were observed in 256 cases (4.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The time interval between the last instillation and the onset of the complication was 8.3 &plusmn;6.5 days. Infections included miliary tuberculosis (six patients), persistent fever (two patients), and lymphocytic meningitis, arthritis, and tubulointerstitial nephritis (one case each). All but one responded favorably to a six-month course of three-drug antituberculosis therapy, with the one death due to rapid multiorgan failure. Importantly, no risk factors could be identified as predisposing to serious BCG infection, including time from transurethral surgery (average time 33 days), number of prior BCG instillations (average 9), comorbidity, age, history of tuberculosis, or factors potentially associated with some degree of immunosuppression.</p><p>Furthermore, in the associated comprehensive literature review of 282 cases of BCG infection from 1975 to 2013, the authors were able to confirm and elaborate on their institutional findings. The types of BCG infection observed are documented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F104208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104208 \">table 1</a>). About three-fourths of the BCG infections were systemic, while one-fourth were local. The median time interval from transurethral surgery to BCG initiation was 30 days, and the median number of BCG instillations was 6. Onset of infection was 13.5 days (interquartile range 2 to 195 days) in disseminated cases of infection. Acid-fast bacilli staining, conventional mycobacterial culture, and PCR-based assays were diagnostic in 25, 41, and 42 percent of cases, respectively, with positive results more likely in disseminated cases and more PCR diagnoses (53 percent) in cases since 2000. Histological demonstration of granulomatous inflammation was found in 86 percent of cases, however, and underscores its relevance in the diagnostic workup.</p><p>The median duration of (typically) multidrug antituberculosis therapy was six months. Systemic corticosteroid therapy was most often used in cases of disseminated infection (42 percent) and in those with ocular involvement (78 percent), hepatitis (50 percent), reactive arthritis (38 percent), and persistent fever (25 percent). BCG-attributable mortality was 5.4 percent and was higher in those over 65 years of age, with disseminated disease, and with vascular involvement. Long-term complications developed in 7.4 percent of cases with ocular loss, chronic arthralgias, and end-stage renal disease leading the way. Overall, 86 percent had a satisfactory resolution of the complication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Localized disease</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">BCG cystitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of bladder irritation, such as dysuria and frequency, develop in the majority of patients within two to four hours of Bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) instillation; a low-grade fever and malaise may accompany these symptoms, especially in patients who have received prior intravesical instillations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Such manifestations generally resolve within 48 hours.</p><p>Infection can also spread locally to involve structures within the genitourinary tract. Such infections include granulomatous ulceration of the glans penis, prostatitis, epididymitis, ureteral obstruction, bladder contracture, and renal abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Granulomatous prostatitis may be quite common, although symptomatic disease is not. In one series of 12 patients undergoing cystoprostatectomy following BCG instillation, 9 had evidence of granulomatous prostatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels rose following treatment in 27 of 36 patients (75 percent) in another study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In 15 cases (42 percent), the increase was clinically significant; PSA returned to normal levels within three months.</p><p>Symptoms from BCG infection of any of these structures cannot be distinguished from infection due to other organisms. This is particularly problematic as up to 20 percent of patients receiving intravesical BCG develop a conventional bacterial urinary tract infection (UTI) at some point during treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Occurrence in proximity to local instillation of BCG can be helpful, but cases of epididymo-orchitis arising years after the BCG therapy have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Thus, a level of clinical suspicion must be maintained once this treatment has been administered. In one report of eight cases with a review of the literature, the authors describe both early and late (&gt;1 year) presentations of BCG infection; the late disease involved local granulomatous infection in the genitourinary tract, usually with positive cultures for <em>M. bovis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Similarly, a late ulcerative inflammatory cystitis has been reported to be associated with persistent local BCG infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most serious complications of BCG intravesical instillation relate to disseminated infection. Sepsis is the most fulminant manifestation, but infection of a number of organs can also arise. In the small case series cited above, early disease presenting in the first 8 to 12 weeks after instillation included systemic symptoms; three of the five patients had pneumonitis and hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. While noncaseating granulomas were found in tissue biopsies, <em>M. bovis</em> was not typically recovered. In another case report, peritoneal tuberculosis was observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is important to note that leukocytosis is not always observed with disseminated BCG infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Sepsis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A classic sepsis syndrome can occur, complete with fever, rigors, hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. These manifestations are probably due to high levels of cytokines released directly into the bloodstream as part of the hypersensitivity response (so-called cytokine storm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. This rare event typically develops soon after the BCG instillation. Delayed cases have been reported years after an apparently uncomplicated treatment; the administration of systemic glucocorticoids may have caused reactivation of a dormant focus in one of these latter cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Hepatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Granulomatous hepatitis arises rarely as either an early or late complication of BCG intravesical instillations. The typical presentation was illustrated by a case report in which a patient presented with fever and jaundice five days after a particularly difficult catheterization, which had been associated with gross hematuria; this individual had undergone 13 previous instillations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although most cases develop days to months after multiple instillations, <em>M. bovis</em> was recovered from blood cultures within hours of the first instillation in one case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Patients with granulomatous hepatitis present with symptoms and signs of hepatitis, including fever, anorexia, and jaundice. Noncaseating granulomas are found on liver biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; eosinophils can also be seen in these specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Three cases have been reported in which renal insufficiency accompanied granulomatous hepatitis; epithelioid granulomas were found on renal biopsy in two of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A progressive mycotic abdominal aneurysm was also noted in one case of granulomatous hepatitis, which occurred one year after the last BCG instillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Dyspnea, accompanied by fever and malaise, has been described, but relatively asymptomatic or subclinical cases have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Progression to respiratory compromise can occur. Routine chest radiograph imaging is not sufficiently sensitive, as it failed to reveal a miliary dissemination pattern in about one-quarter of the cases subsequently documented by CT scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A rare case of symptomatic BCG-induced pleural effusion accompanied by a subcutaneous chest nodule positive for acid-fast bacilli six years after BCG intravesical therapy has also been described, illustrating the pleomorphic nature of BCG infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Osteomyelitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteomyelitis is another rare complication of disseminated BCG infection.
