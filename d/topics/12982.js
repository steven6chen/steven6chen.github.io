While it is often discussed together with the indolent forms of NHL, its behavior is more often that of an aggressive lymphoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-the-hematopoietic-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of the hematopoietic neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>MCL has been previously referred to as intermediate lymphocytic lymphoma, mantle zone lymphoma, centrocytic lymphoma, and lymphocytic lymphoma of intermediate differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The pathobiology of MCL will be reviewed here. Information regarding the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of MCL is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of mantle cell lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CELL OF ORIGIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cases are postulated to derive from na&iuml;ve pre-germinal center B cells of the mantle zone, while a subset of MCL may originate from marginal zone or peripheral blood memory B cells.</p><p>The pre-germinal center ancestry of most MCLs is principally supported by the absence of somatic mutations in the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (<em>IgVH</em>) genes, which serve as a marker of germinal center transit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, several studies have found somatic hypermutation in approximately 20 to 30 percent of MCL cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. <em>IGHV3-21</em> and <em>IGHV4-34</em> usage was significantly overrepresented in MCLs in these studies. The <em>V3-21</em> expressing cases were highly associated with expression of the same light chain, <em>IGLV3-19</em>, suggesting that these tumor cells are stimulated by an autoantigen recognized by the Ig formed by pairing of these heavy and light chains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The oncogenic driver in the overwhelming majority of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is overexpression of the <em>CCND1</em> gene (also called <em>BCL1</em> or <em>PRAD1</em>) located at 11q13 that encodes the cyclin D1 protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Cyclin D1 is not expressed in normal B lymphocytes. Expression of cyclin D1 promotes cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase and proliferation. Cyclin D1 expression alone is not sufficient for the transformation of normal B lymphocytes, as transgenic mice that overexpress cyclin D1 alone do not develop lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition to cyclin D1 expression, MCL tumors demonstrate a decreased response to DNA damage and enhanced cell survival (impaired apoptosis). Alterations in these three pathways (ie, cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis) are described in the following sections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73115\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73115 \">figure 1</a>). Abnormalities in other pathways are likely, but remain to be further characterized. Several groups have used unbiased genome-wide approaches to identify genes that are recurrently mutated or dysregulated in MCL besides <em>CCND1</em>. Two independent analyses showed that a subset of cases of MCL has gain-of-function mutations in or hypomethylation of the gene that encodes the Notch1 receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], suggesting that Notch signaling has an oncogenic role in some cases of MCL. Another deep-sequencing study identified 25 genes that are recurrently mutated in MCL, including genes involved in DNA damage responses (<em>ATM, TP53</em>), apoptosis (<em>BIRC3, TLR2</em>), and chromatin modification (<em>WHSC1, MLL2, MEF2B</em>), as well as the gene encoding the Notch2 receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cell cycle progression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All cases of MCL demonstrate increased cell division and replication. In the vast majority of cases, cyclin D1 overexpression drives increased proliferation. A small number of cases that resemble MCL but do not express cyclin D1 appear to stem from the deregulation of cyclin D2 or cyclin D3. Preliminary data suggest that Notch signaling in MCLs with Notch1 mutations directly upregulates transcription of the MYC gene, another factor that stimulates cell growth and proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. An additional potential mechanism for increased MYC activity is stabilization of MYC protein through signals that require MALT1, a component of the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 complex that links B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling to NF-kappa-B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Cyclin D1 expression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cyclin D1 is not expressed in normal B lymphocytes and its expression appears to contribute to the development of the overwhelming majority of MCL cases. Cyclin D1 is an activating regulatory subunit for cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Activated cyclin D-CDK complexes phosphorylate and inactivate retinoblastoma protein (Rb), a potent inhibitor of G1 to S phase progression. This complex also binds cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKI1B, also known as Kip1 and p27) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The binding of cyclin <span class=\"nowrap\">D1/CDK4</span> complexes to CDKI1B stabilizes and enhances the activity of cyclin <span class=\"nowrap\">D1/CDK4</span> while also inhibiting CDKI1B, which when free acts as an inhibitor of other CDK complexes that are required at slightly later phases of the cell cycle.</p><p>Aberrant expression of cyclin D1 may occur through at least one of the following mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The (11;14)(q13;q32) translocation juxtaposes the DNA coding sequence for cyclin D1 at 11q13 with the immunoglobulin heavy-chain joining region at 14q32 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. This translocation appears to be mediated by recombinase-activating genes (RAG) and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. While found in the majority of MCL cases, t(11;14) is not specific for MCL. While the nontranslocated <em>CCND1</em> allele is usually located far from the nucleolus, the translocated allele is preferentially localized to the perinucleolar area, an area with an increased density of transcriptional activators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

These truncations stabilize the <em>CCND1</em> RNA transcript, resulting in increased <em>CCND1</em> mRNA and increased protein levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. An increase in truncated relative to full-length cyclin D1 mRNAs is associated with poor clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].

In addition, gene expression profile analyses have confirmed the central role of cyclin D1 in MCL pathogenesis.

Of six cases identified in one study, two overexpressed <em>CCND2</em> and four overexpressed <em>CCND3</em>, typically without chromosomal rearrangements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In another study, 22 of 40 cases of cyclin D1 negative MCL displayed a <em>CCND2</em> gene rearrangement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. These tumors expressed the transcription factor SOX11 and had an otherwise typical morphology and immunophenotype (CD5+, CD10-, CD23-) for MCL. Cyclins D1, D2, and D3 are highly homologous and appear to be functionally interchangeable, and MCLs with cyclin D1 or cyclin D2 dysregulation appear to be very similar in terms of their presentation and clinical course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Although the current WHO classification advises that the diagnosis of cyclin D1 negative MCL must be made only with great caution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], these new data suggest that tumors fitting the criteria described above are best classified as MCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

The cyclin <span class=\"nowrap\">E/CDK2</span> complex is normally inhibited by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKI1B, also known as Kip1 and p27), levels of which are decreased in MCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. CDKI1B is typically expressed at lower levels in highly proliferative subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In MCL, there is a wide range of CDKI1B expression with greater expression in more highly proliferative tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

This impaired response is largely due to defects in the <em>TP53</em> and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (<em>ATM</em>) genes. In addition, the cell cycle checkpoint kinases (CHK) 1 and 2 are downregulated in some MCL cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">TP53</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations of <em>TP53</em> are seen in 10 to 25 percent of MCL cases and are associated with more aggressive histology and shorter survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/27,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,34-36</a>]. The normal <em>TP53</em> gene, located at 17p13.1, encodes a tumor suppressor protein that binds DNA and transcriptionally activates growth inhibitory genes. Normally, activated TP53 induces a variety of growth-limiting responses, including cell cycle arrest (thereby facilitating DNA repair), apoptosis, senescence, and differentiation. Downregulation of <em>TP53</em> expression or expression of mutant <em>TP53</em> products results in a loss of the normal growth-limiting activities of this gene.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">ATM gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deletion of or point mutations in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (<em>ATM</em>) tumor suppressor gene (11q22-q23) are seen in approximately one-third to one-half of MCL cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/23,34,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,34,37</a>].

The <span class=\"nowrap\">PI3K/AKT</span> pathway also increases the levels of nuclear factor-kappa B and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), resulting in a decrease in functional TP53 and subsequent cell survival.

Of note, as with other relatively indolent B cell tumors such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibrutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibrutinib</a> have shown excellent, durable single agent activity in MCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. BTK functions downstream of the membrane-bound B cell receptor (BCR) and links constitutive BCR signaling to <span class=\"nowrap\">PI3K/AKT</span> activation and nuclear factor-kappa B activation, consistent with the view that these pathways are critical for MCL growth and survival.

Early studies suggested that NFkB is constitutively activated in at least a subset of MCL and that ex vivo treatment with an NFkB inhibitor results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

While ibrutinib-sensitive MCL models exhibited activation of NFkB through the so-called classical pathway, in insensitive cell lines NFkB was activated through an alternative pathway involving the protein kinase NIK (also called mitogen-activated protein 3 kinase 14 or MAP3K14) both in vitro and in vivo. RNA sequencing revealed genetic lesions in alternative NF-kappaB pathway signaling components in ibrutinib-insensitive cell lines, and sequencing of 165 primary MCLs identified recurrent mutations in the alternative NFkB pathway components TRAF2 or BIRC3 in 15 percent of tumors. This study suggests that NIK may be a therapeutic target in MCLs that are refractory to BCR pathway inhibitors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TP53 can induce apoptotic cell death.

Another study compared the gene expression profiles of indolent MCL with conventional MCL, and identified a 13-gene signature that was highly expressed in conventional MCL, but underexpressed in indolent MCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In both the test and validation cohorts, lack of expression of <em>SOX11</em> was associated with an indolent course. MCLs with activating Notch1 mutations have also been reported to pursue a more aggressive course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], but this observation needs to be confirmed in other series. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a mature B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), which accounts for approximately 7 percent of adult NHLs in the United States and Europe. While it is often discussed together with the indolent forms of NHL, its behavior is more often that of an aggressive lymphoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most MCL cases are postulated to derive from na&iuml;ve pre-germinal center B cells of the mantle zone, while a subset of MCL may originate from marginal zone or peripheral blood memory B cells. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Cell of origin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All cases of MCL demonstrate increased cell division and replication. In the vast majority of cases, expression of the <em>CCND1</em> gene, located at 11q13, drives cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. A minority of cases does not demonstrate cyclin D1, but often overexpresses other cell cycle mediators, particularly cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73115\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73115 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Cell cycle progression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to cyclin D1 expression, MCL tumors demonstrate a decreased response to DNA damage and enhanced cell survival (impaired apoptosis). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Impaired DNA damage response'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Enhanced cell survival'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Jiang W, Kahn SM, Zhou P, et al.
