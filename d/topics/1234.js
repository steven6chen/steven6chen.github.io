Evaluation of a murmur is the most common reason for referral to a pediatric cardiologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-a-cardiac-murmur/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. While the prevalence of congenital heart disease is approximately one percent, a majority of children have innocent murmurs at some time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-a-cardiac-murmur/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal cardiac abnormalities: Screening, evaluation, and pregnancy management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pregnancy history</strong> &ndash; Certain maternal medical conditions can be associated with the development of congenital cardiac disease in the fetus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F103088\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103088 \">table 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Affected parent or sibling</strong> &ndash; The risk for congenital heart disease is higher if a parent or sibling has a structural congenital heart defect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F103088\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103088 \">table 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other congenital anomalies</strong> &ndash; Various genetic syndromes are associated with an increased incidence of congenital heart disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81423 \">table 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient age</strong> &ndash; In the neonatal period, murmurs present in the first six hours of life are usually associated with a valve problem, either regurgitation (tricuspid valve or mitral valve) or stenosis (aortic valve or pulmonary valve). Murmurs detected after six hours of age are more likely to represent shunt lesions (eg, atrial or ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus) or peripheral pulmonary stenosis as these murmurs become more apparent as pulmonary vascular resistance falls. However, a valve problem may also present after six hours of age, particularly if an earlier examination was not performed or the neonate was uncooperative at the time of the initial examination. The presence of an early murmur does not rule out a septal defect. For example, neonates with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82493\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82493 \">figure 1</a>) typically have an early murmur of pulmonary stenosis but also have a ventricular septal defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-a-cardiac-murmur/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

Other congenital heart lesions are unlikely to present at this age unless access to medical care was limited at an earlier age. A new murmur that occurs in a patient with a history of recent or frequent streptococcal pharyngitis may represent cardiac involvement with rheumatic fever. The left-sided valves are mainly involved in this condition, with mitral regurgitation more common than aortic regurgitation in acute cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-common-causes-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-infants-and-children#H347762898\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of common causes of cardiac murmurs in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Children &gt;1 year'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Symptoms</strong> &ndash; When evaluating an infant or child with a cardiac murmur, it is important to assess whether there are any symptoms concerning for heart disease. Concerning symptoms at any age include respiratory difficulties, diaphoresis (especially with exertion), and poor growth. In infants, symptoms may include poor feeding or excessive irritability. In older children, chest pain and syncope are important symptoms. Symptoms that may raise suspicion for heart disease in children are discussed in greater detail separately.

Noncardiac physical exam findings that are suggestive of cardiac disease are discussed separately.

Abnormal heart rates (bradycardia or tachycardia) can be due to cardiac and noncardiac causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71622%7EPEDS%2F65427\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71622 graphicRef65427 \">table 5A-B</a>).

A visible apical impulse can be present in left ventricular volume overload lesions that include significant mitral or aortic valve regurgitation or large left-to-right shunts at the ventricular or great vessel level. A visible parasternal impulse can be present in right ventricular volume overload lesions including significant pulmonary or tricuspid valve regurgitation, large atrial septal defect (ASD), and large arteriovenous malformation (AVM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-a-cardiac-murmur/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14181590\"><span class=\"h2\">Palpation of the chest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following findings should be noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Apical impulse</strong> &ndash; The apical impulse is palpated using the tips of the middle and index fingers and is usually located in the fourth or fifth intercostal space in the left midclavicular line. The impulse is laterally displaced in lesions associated with a dilated left ventricle (aortic or mitral valve regurgitation, large left-to-right shunts at the ventricular or great vessel level). The impulse is more medial in patients with mesocardia or dextroposition (left-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia, scimitar syndrome, left lobar emphysema), and is present in the right chest in patients with dextrocardia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Right ventricular impulse</strong> &ndash; The right ventricular impulse is palpated by placing the hand along the left sternal border. The impulse is prominent in patients with right ventricular hypertension (eg, large ventricular septal defect [VSD], large PDA) or right ventricular volume overload (ASD, partial or total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77375 \">figure 5</a>), large AVM).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Systolic thrill</strong> &ndash; A systolic thrill represents the tactile component of a loud murmur (grade IV or higher) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F105030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105030 \">table 6</a>). Thrills are produced by flow across a stenotic site (subvalvar, valvar, supravalvar, or interventricular septum). A thrill associated with aortic or pulmonary stenosis is suggestive of severe obstruction; however, a thrill associated with a VSD does not necessarily indicate a large defect as it may be due to a large amount of large left-to-right flow across the defect or a large pressure gradient between ventricles. The location and timing of a thrill aid in diagnosis:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Left lower sternal border &ndash; A systolic thrill at the left lower sternal border can occur with VSDs, as described above. Occasionally, patients with tricuspid regurgitation may have this finding if there is right ventricular hypertension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Left upper sternal border &ndash; Severe pulmonary stenosis may produce a systolic thrill at the left upper sternal border.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Right upper sternal border &ndash; Severe aortic stenosis may produce a systolic thrill at the right upper sternal border as long as cardiac output is normal. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Suprasternal notch &ndash; A systolic thrill in the suprasternal notch or over the course of the carotid artery can occur in patients with aortic stenosis and, when present, is useful in distinguishing this condition from pulmonary stenosis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Apex &ndash; A systolic thrill at the apex can occur in patients with mitral regurgitation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diastolic thrills &ndash; Diastolic thrills are uncommon but can occur in patients with severe mitral stenosis, aortic regurgitation, or pulmonary regurgitation and are located at the apex, right upper sternal border, or left sternal border, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Palpable second heart sound</strong> <strong>(S2)</strong> &ndash; A palpable S2 at the left upper sternal border indicates that a semilunar valve is closing under high pressure. This finding usually indicates the presence of severe pulmonary artery hypertension. The pulmonary valve typically is the most anterior of the four cardiac valves, and its closure can be palpated if pulmonary pressure is at or near systemic level. In patients with unrepaired transposition of the great arteries, the aortic valve is the most anterior valve and its closure can occasionally be palpated; such patients are also cyanotic.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14181621\"><span class=\"h1\">AUSCULTATION OF HEART SOUNDS AND MURMURS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For thorough auscultation it is helpful to focus on one aspect of the examination at a time: first heart sound (S1), second heart sound (S2), third heart sound (S3), fourth heart sound (S4), opening snap, ejection click, pericardial friction rub, and murmurs (systolic, diastolic, continuous) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-a-cardiac-murmur/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Murmurs are characterized last because details of the other components are required for accurate assessment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14181627\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart sounds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first (S1) and second (S2) heart sounds are produced by closure of the atrioventricular (AV) and semilunar valves, respectively. Third (S3) and fourth (S4) heart sounds are usually associated with cardiac pathology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11875989\"><span class=\"h3\">S1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>S1 is produced by closure of the AV valves and corresponds to the QRS complex on the electrocardiogram. S1 is usually a single sound but occasionally is split if the mitral and tricuspid valves close at slightly different times. A split S1 can be a normal variation and also can occur in patients with right bundle branch block due to delayed closure of the tricuspid valve.</p><p>A split S1, if present, is usually more prominent at the left lower sternal border (tricuspid valve area) than the apex (mitral valve area). A perceived &quot;split S1&quot; that is more prominent at the apex may instead represent an early systolic ejection click produced by a bicuspid aortic valve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104790\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104790 \">movie 1</a>).</p><p>The intensity of S1 is increased when the valves close at greater velocity (eg, high output states) or when there is greater excursion of valve leaflets (eg, short PR interval, mild mitral stenosis) since the elevated atrial pressure maintains a more open valve position. The intensity of S1 is decreased in low output states, mitral regurgitation due to failure of valve coaptation, and decreased valve excursion (long PR interval, severe mitral stenosis, elevated ventricular end-diastolic pressure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-a-cardiac-murmur/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11875996\"><span class=\"h3\">S2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>S2 is produced by closure of the semilunar valves and is best heard at the left upper sternal border. The characteristics of S2 can provide important information about cardiac physiology:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Splitting</strong> &ndash; The aortic and pulmonary valve components of S2 normally vary with the respiratory cycle, being split in inspiration and single in expiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104781\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104781 \">movie 2</a>). Physiologic splitting of S2 occurs due to decreased intrathoracic pressure during inspiration resulting in increased venous return to the right side of the heart, which in turn prolongs right ventricular systole and delays closure of the pulmonary valve (P2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-a-cardiac-murmur/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Effects of inspiration on the left side of the heart are the opposite; pulmonary venous return decreases, left ventricular systole is shortened, and aortic valve closure (A2) occurs earlier. The normal split of S2 in inspiration is approximately 0.05 seconds. During expiration, intrathoracic pressure returns to baseline and the semilunar valves closure is perceived as a single sound. In children &gt;3 years of age, the examiner can detect the physiologic split of S2 by focusing attention on expiration. In infants and younger children whose respiratory rate and heart rate are faster, usually the best an examiner can do is to note variability in S2 with some beats being single and others split without specifically correlating the findings with the respiratory cycle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wide splitting &ndash; In conditions that delay closure of the pulmonary valve, S2 is widely split but still varies during the respiratory cycle. These conditions include pulmonary valve stenosis, idiopathic dilation of the main pulmonary artery, and delayed electrical activation of the right ventricle as occurs with right bundle branch block (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104782\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104782 \">movie 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-a-cardiac-murmur/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients with severe mitral regurgitation can also have this feature due to earlier closure of the aortic valve associated with shortened left ventricular systole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-a-cardiac-murmur/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Other less common conditions include coronary sinus septal defect, large AVMs, and partial or total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77375 \">figure 5</a>). The split of S2 can be as long as 0.10 second [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-a-cardiac-murmur/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-atrial-septal-defects-asds-and-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-isolated-asds-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of atrial septal defects (ASDs), and clinical features and diagnosis of isolated ASDs in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Paradoxical splitting &ndash; This feature is uncommon in the first decade of life and is associated with delayed closure of the aortic valve that occurs with left bundle branch block. In such patients, in expiration, the aortic valve closes after the pulmonary valve; in inspiration, the effects on systemic and pulmonary venous return outlined with normal patients produce a single S2. Occasionally, patients with severe aortic stenosis can also have this feature. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=left-bundle-branch-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Left bundle branch block&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Valvar aortic stenosis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intensity</strong> &mdash; The intensity of S2 depends on the pressure that closes the valve. After the neonatal transition period, the systolic pulmonary pressure is approximately one-fifth that of the systemic circulation. As a result, the pressure that closes the pulmonary valve is low and the pulmonary component of S2 is normally soft. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reduced intensity &ndash; In patients with semilunar valve stenosis (aortic or pulmonary), the excursion of the affected valve is reduced and its closure sound is softened. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased intensity &ndash; In patients with pulmonary artery hypertension, the pulmonary valve closes both under high pressure and earlier since the elevated diastolic pressure in the pulmonary artery exceeds ventricular diastolic pressure sooner. This produces a loud pulmonic component to S2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104785\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104785 \">movie 5</a>). The pulmonary valve is typically the most anterior of the four valves and is located in the immediate retrosternal region at the left upper sternal border. If the pulmonary component of S2 occurs close enough to the aortic component, S2 will be perceived as a single loud sound.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Patients with systemic arterial hypertension have an increased intensity of the aortic component of S2; since the aortic valve is positioned more posteriorly, this feature is not as apparent as the prominent pulmonary component in patients with pulmonary hypertension.

S4 occurs in late diastole during the atrial contraction phase and is coincident with the P wave on the electrocardiogram. It is best heard with the bell of the stethoscope.
