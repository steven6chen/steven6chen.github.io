This nonspecific presentation is magnified during pregnancy due to an overlap between symptoms seen in patients with PE and those associated with the normal physiologic changes of pregnancy (eg, dyspnea occurs in up to 70 percent of normal pregnancies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, identifying a clinically important PE during pregnancy is challenging, and it is imperative that clinicians understand the potential for both overdiagnosing and underdiagnosing PE during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-early-pregnancy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of early pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations of early pregnancy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Cardiovascular and hemodynamic changes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Physiologic respiratory changes and dyspnea&quot;</a>.)</p><p>PE has a wide variety of presenting features, ranging from asymptomatic to shock or sudden death. Pregnant patients were excluded from the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis II (PIOPED II) study that described signs and symptoms of PE in nonpregnant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, smaller trials suggest that the presenting features in pregnant patients are similar to those reported in PIOPED II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. As an example, in a study of 38 pregnant women with confirmed PE, dyspnea (62 percent), pleuritic chest pain (55 percent), cough (24 percent), and sweating (18 percent) were the four most common presenting features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Similar to nonpregnant patients, any one or combination of the following symptoms &ndash; acute-onset dyspnea, pleuritic pain, and hemoptysis &ndash; should always raise alarm and increase the clinical suspicion for a PE during pregnancy. The clinical presentation of PE in nonpregnant patients is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of acute pulmonary embolism in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1312641\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arterial blood gases, D-dimer levels, and echocardiography are often performed but are neither sensitive nor specific as diagnostic or pretest probability tools for the evaluation of suspected PE during pregnancy. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Arterial blood gases</strong> &ndash; For nonpregnant and pregnant patients suspected of having a PE, arterial blood gas analysis is neither sensitive nor specific diagnostically. A respiratory alkalosis is a very common feature of both pregnancy and PE. As in the nonpregnant population, a normal PO<sub>2</sub>, PCO<sub>2</sub>, or alveolar-arterial difference is common with PE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In one small retrospective study of arterial blood gases in pregnant women with documented PE, 10 of 17 patients (59 percent) had a normal alveolar-arterial difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Nonetheless, the presence of hypoxemia with normal chest radiograph should raise the clinical suspicion for PE in pregnancy and prompt further evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H1319716\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis of PE'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism#H325664986\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism&quot;, section on 'Laboratory tests'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>D-dimer</strong> &ndash; D-dimer levels increase during the course of a normal pregnancy and slowly decline postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. Interpretation of D-dimer levels during pregnancy and the puerperium is complicated by a lack of normal reference ranges in this setting. Thus, D-dimer levels have limited utility for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pregnancy. As an example, in a retrospective observational series of 37 pregnant women with suspected PE, when compared with <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(V/Q)</span> scanning, D-dimer levels assessed by immunoturbidimetric assay (&lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> had an estimated sensitivity and specificity of 73 and 15 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Considering the low sensitivity (high false negative rate) and specificity (high false positive rate) of D-dimer in this setting, a high D-dimer is not diagnostic of PE, and a low D-dimer (even &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> only modestly lowers the suspicion but does not effectively eliminate PE from the differential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

Occasionally, an echocardiogram can be performed to exclude pregnancy-related cardiomyopathy or to evaluate the size of the right ventricle (RV) in a patient with confirmed PE. However, the prognostic value of RV dilation by echocardiogram has not been formally evaluated in pregnancy.

The two most common modalities for imaging are lung scintigraphy <span class=\"nowrap\">(ventilation/perfusion</span> scanning <span class=\"nowrap\">[V/Q])</span> and computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography (MRPA) is not validated, and although contrast-enhanced pulmonary angiography was the gold standard, neither test is commonly used in the pregnant population.

Abnormalities on chest radiograph are common in nonpregnant patients with suspected PE, and an abnormal chest radiograph can interfere with the interpretation of further testing (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> scan). However, since pregnant women are typically younger and healthier than the general population of patients with a suspected PE, they are more likely to have a normal chest radiograph. </p><p>A peripheral infarct might be suggested by a shallow wedge-shaped opacity in the periphery of the lung with its base against the pleural surface (Hampton's hump). However, this sign and other radiographic features (atelectasis, infiltrates) are neither sensitive nor specific for a diagnosis of PE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. </p><p>Despite its poor diagnostic accuracy, a chest radiograph should be performed in every pregnant patient in whom a PE is suspected.

Normal or very low probability scans are associated with a 0 to 6 percent chance of having a PE. In contrast, depending upon the patient population, high probability scans are associated with a 56 to 96 percent chance of having a PE. All other scans are indeterminate. &#160;</p><p>In the general population, there is a high rate of indeterminate scans due to the high prevalence of abnormal chest radiographs from underlying cardiopulmonary disease.

A clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of suspected PE in pregnancy, jointly issued by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Society of Thoracic Radiology, was published in 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This guideline is a useful resource for the clinician to make decisions regarding the risks and benefits of testing pregnant patients so that a diagnosis can be made promptly and therapy appropriately administered. The following sections describe our approach to the diagnosis of PE, which is largely consistent with this guideline.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1312732\"><span class=\"h2\">Pretest probability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians are notoriously poor at estimating the probability of PE in pregnant women and there are no validated clinical prediction guidelines for determining the pretest probability of PE in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The difficulty in determining the pretest probability may be due to the poor performance of scoring systems for PE in pregnancy as well as the nonspecific and shared symptoms between PE and pregnancy. &#160;</p><p><strong>Wells Score</strong> &#9472; The Wells scoring system is the most common scoring system used for PE in the <strong>nonpregnant</strong> patient. The Wells score has limited value in the pregnant population, probably due to the high prevalence of baseline tachycardia and the low likelihood of certain risk factors (eg, malignancy or recent surgery) that are listed on the scoring system. &#160;</p><p><strong>Presenting features</strong> &#9472; As described above, the clinical manifestations of PE are variable and nonspecific. This nonspecific presentation is magnified during pregnancy due to an overlap between symptoms seen in patients with PE and those associated with the normal physiologic changes of pregnancy (eg, dyspnea occurs in up to 70 percent of normal pregnancies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, identifying a PE during pregnancy is difficult and dependent upon a higher than usual index of clinical suspicion. &#160;</p><p>One study evaluated the predictive value of six presenting features (chest pain, dyspnea, desaturation, tachycardia, increased alveolar-arterial gradient &ge;15 mmHg, and PaO<sub>2</sub> &lt;65 mmHg) in 304 women with suspected PE during pregnancy or postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

The evidence to support choosing one imaging modality over another is weak in the pregnant population. A choice among imaging modalities is typically based upon physician judgment, patient preference, comorbidities (eg, renal insufficiency or allergy to contrast) and potential toxicities to mother and fetus. </p><p>In general, when considering a diagnosis of PE in a pregnant patient, we suggest the following approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54668\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54668 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proximal vein compression ultrasonography (CUS) should not be routinely performed as an initial test, unless the clinical evaluation suggests a coexistent deep venous thrombosis (DVT) (eg, leg pain, swelling, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> erythema). If CUS is negative or not available, and the clinical suspicion for PE remains, further imaging is indicated. This preference recognizes the low prevalence of DVT in pregnant patients who present with suspected PE. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest radiograph should be considered in every patient who presents with respiratory symptoms concerning for PE. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the chest radiograph is normal, <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(V/Q)</span> scanning is preferred. <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> scanning is sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of PE in the context of a normal radiograph.

Modulating factors that affect modality choice, including the risks associated with radiation and contrast, are discussed below.

The treatments for DVT and PE are identical such that documentation of a DVT is considered by most clinicians sufficient to terminate the diagnostic evaluation and justify immediate therapy. We reserve CUS for pregnant patients suspected of having a PE in whom the clinical evaluation suggests a coexistent DVT. If a suspicion for PE remains, a negative CUS should not reassure the clinician, nor should it obviate the need for further imaging. Signs and symptoms suggestive of a DVT are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis#H1544043\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Deep vein thrombosis in pregnancy: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>No direct evidence supports the use of CUS as an initial diagnostic test for the evaluation of a pregnant patient with suspected PE. The prevalence of DVT in pregnant patients suspected of having PE is unknown but estimated to be low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In nonpregnant patients with suspected PE, the prevalence of DVT is 9 to 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/41-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-44</a>]. These data are derived from the general population that has a known prevalence of PE of 20 to 36 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. In this context, it has been estimated that to detect one DVT in a patient with suspected PE, the number needed to test is 11 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, in pregnancy, the prevalence of PE is lower, 3 to 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,11,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,29</a>]; thus, the estimated prevalence of DVT in pregnant patients suspected of having a PE is likely significantly lower than that of the general population. As an example, one study reported no cases of DVT in a subpopulation of 69 pregnant women with suspected PE that also underwent evaluation for DVT by bilateral CUS or impedance plethysmography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>These data suggest that the routine use of CUS as an initial diagnostic test in every pregnant patient suspected of having PE is not justified, especially when the suspicion for a DVT is low. Additionally, withholding or administering therapy, while waiting for results of a test with unknown or low diagnostic yield, potentially wastes valuable time in the workup of pregnant patients suspected of having PE. </p><p>We reserve CUS for pregnant patients suspected of having a PE in whom the clinical evaluation suggests a coexistent or symptomatic DVT. A DVT prevalence of up to 9 percent has been reported in this selected population of pregnant women (ie pregnant women clinically suspected of having both PE and DVT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Additionally, although not validated in large studies, the presence of two to three variables of the LEFt clinical prediction rule (left sided symptoms, edema, first trimester) was associated with DVT in 58 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Thus, in the context of suspected PE during pregnancy, it is expected that the diagnostic yield of CUS in those with symptomatic DVT is increased compared to those without a clinical suspicion for DVT.

Additionally, proximal vein CUS may be negative in the setting of PE, because thrombus has travelled to the lung and is no longer present in the proximal vein. In this context, if a suspicion for PE remains, a negative CUS should not reassure the clinician, nor should it obviate the need for further imaging.

The choice of imaging modality <span class=\"nowrap\">(V/Q</span> scan versus CTPA) in pregnant women is challenging.

Staffing burdens for specific tests (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> scanning and vascular studies of the lower extremities) may impede the clinician's ability to make a timely diagnosis.

The reasons for this are unclear but may be due to limited nuclear medicine staff in some institutions to perform and interpret scans especially during off duty hours. Under such circumstances, when the clinical suspicion is high for VTE, perceived roadblocks should not delay therapy while the clinician seeks an alternative modality for a timely diagnosis. </p><p>Clot resolution has not been studied in pregnancy.

Many of the most common signs and symptoms of PE (dyspnea, tachycardia and tachypnea) are associated with a normal pregnancy. For example dyspnea occurs at some point in up to 70 percent of normal pregnancies, often stabilizing near term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,8,66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,66,67</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The acute development of symptoms (eg, dyspnea, chest pain) may favor a diagnosis of acute PE rather than pregnancy-related symptoms.

Preventing deaths from PE in pregnancy requires a high index of clinical suspicion and an accurate diagnostic approach so that appropriate treatment with anticoagulation can be initiated in a timely fashion.

This nonspecific presentation poses challenges during pregnancy due to an overlap with symptoms due to the normal physiologic changes of pregnancy.

Preference for use of one imaging modality over another is typically based upon physician judgment, patient preference, comorbidities (eg, renal insufficiency or allergy to contrast) and potential toxicities to mother and fetus.
