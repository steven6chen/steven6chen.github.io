This topic briefly discusses the management of patients with unstable angina or acute NSTEMI in the hours and days following reperfusion and refers the reader to more detailed discussions of these issues in other topics.</p><p>The following interventions are beneficial in the majority of patients with NSTEMI or unstable angina who have undergone early interventions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta blockers (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Oral beta blockers'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Statins (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Statin therapy'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggressive management of recurrent myocardial ischemia or reinfarction (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent chest pain'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> and P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker therapy is indicated in all patients after NSTEMI for at least one month and up to a year, irrespective of whether revascularization or stenting occurs.
