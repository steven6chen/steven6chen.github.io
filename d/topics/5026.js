Early identification also permits earlier treatment of underlying medical conditions that present with developmental-behavioral problems. (See <a href=\"#H2327465832\" class=\"local\">'Benefits of surveillance and screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perceived potential harms of screening include unnecessary referrals for developmental-behavioral evaluation, undue anxiety or stigma for families, missed or delayed diagnosis, and increased burden (eg, time, documentation) for pediatric practices. (See <a href=\"#H2867086199\" class=\"local\">'Perceived harms and burdens of surveillance and screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Developmental surveillance is the process through which children with developmental delay or who are at risk for developmental delay are identified. It is an essential component of routine well-child care and consists of eliciting and attending to parental concerns, maintaining a developmental history, observing parent-child interactions, identifying risk and protective factors, and formulating findings and plans. (See <a href=\"#H2099366119\" class=\"local\">'Approach to surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Developmental-behavioral screening refers to the use of a standardized test to identify asymptomatic children at risk for a developmental disorder; children who screen positive should undergo developmental-behavioral evaluation. Screening enhances clinical impressions formed through developmental surveillance. (See <a href=\"#H2651325861\" class=\"local\">'Approach to screening'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1543866660\" class=\"local\">'Rationale'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our approach to developmental-behavioral screening varies with age and symptoms:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For children of all ages, we provide developmental-behavioral or mental health screening any time a parent or clinician has concerns about development, behavior, or mental health. The screening test may be targeted to the concern (eg, motor development, attention) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F116108\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116108 \">table 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F116107\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116107 \">table 9</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1179618580\" class=\"local\">'Children &lt;4 years'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1981414841\" class=\"local\">'Children &ge;4 years'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For children younger than four years who have no symptoms or signs of developmental-behavioral problems, we suggest periodic developmental screening (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We provide general developmental screening with a validated screening test at the 9-month, 18-month, and 24- or 30-month visits and screening for autism spectrum disorder at the 18- and 24-month visits (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F116108\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116108 \">table 8</a>). Clinical impressions of development and behavior are less accurate than validated screening tests, and relying on surveillance alone may miss children with developmental-behavioral problems who would benefit from intervention. (See <a href=\"#H1179618580\" class=\"local\">'Children &lt;4 years'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-surveillance-and-screening-in-primary-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Surveillance and screening in primary care&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>At the four-year well-child visit, we focus developmental-behavioral screening on school readiness and motor skills (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F103006\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103006 \">table 6</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1981414841\" class=\"local\">'Children &ge;4 years'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;School readiness for children in the United States&quot;, section on 'Readiness of the child'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For children &ge;5 years who have no symptoms of mental health disorders, we suggest periodic mental health screening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F116107\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116107 \">table 9</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We provide mental health screening annually with a validated behavioral screening test. (See <a href=\"#H1981414841\" class=\"local\">'Children &ge;4 years'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children who have a positive screening test should undergo developmental-behavioral or mental health evaluation, medical evaluation, and be referred for early intervention or early childhood services. (See <a href=\"#H1554574408\" class=\"local\">'Positive screen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the screen is negative and neither the clinician nor the parents have concerns, ongoing developmental surveillance and age-appropriate developmental-behavioral surveillance should continue as scheduled. If the screen is negative but was performed because of clinician or caregiver concern, follow-up is individualized according to the type and level of concern.
