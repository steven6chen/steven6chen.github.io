Psychosis has been defined as a &quot;disruption in thinking, accompanied by delusions or hallucinations&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-department-evaluation-of-acute-onset-psychosis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Delusions represent false, fixed beliefs that cannot be resolved through logical argument, while hallucinations are false perceptions that have no basis in external stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-department-evaluation-of-acute-onset-psychosis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In contrast, delirium is marked by an altered sensorium with waxing and waning deficits in attention and concentration. Orientation and concentration are preserved with functional psychosis. However, the distinction between delirium and psychosis in pediatric patients can be difficult to establish, particularly in younger children. Despite these differences, hallucinations may actually represent a symptom of delirium, and separating psychosis and delirium acutely may be impossible.</p><p>The onset of psychosis is an important diagnostic element. Acute onset occurs more commonly with an underlying medical cause rather than psychiatric disease. Even patients with symptoms suggestive of a primary psychiatric diagnosis should undergo a medical evaluation to exclude possible reversible etiologies of psychosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of psychosis in children encompasses hypoglycemia, cerebral hypoxia, drug toxicity, medical illness, and psychiatric disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52785 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50275\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50275 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Substrate deficiency</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypoglycemia</strong> &ndash; Hypoglycemia is a rare, but important cause of psychosis and hallucinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-department-evaluation-of-acute-onset-psychosis-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. All patients with alterations in mental status require immediate bedside capillary glucose testing. Rapid correction of blood sugar is critical to prevent seizures and persistent neurologic sequelae. Hypoglycemia with abrupt change in behavior may occur in children being treated for Type I and Type II diabetes; alternatively, hypoglycemia may result from ingestions (eg, ethanol, beta-blockers, and sulfonylureas) or from inborn errors of metabolism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to hypoglycemia in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cerebral hypoxia</strong> &ndash; Inadequate brain oxygenation may lead to altered mental status with combative behavior. Thus, any condition that results in hypoxemia (eg, pulmonary insufficiency), insufficient oxygen carrying capacity of the blood (eg, severe anemia), or inadequate brain perfusion (eg, cardiac insufficiency) may result in an encephalopathy with psychotic features. These patients require emergent identification of the underlying cause of cerebral hypoxia and immediate interventions to restore brain oxygenation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug exposures are a common cause of delirium, delusions, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychosis, especially in the adolescent population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Drug overdose or abuse</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anticholinergic toxicity</strong> &ndash; Mental status changes from central anticholinergic effects may occur with few if any peripheral signs. Anticholinergic toxicity can cause psychosis in both children and adolescents. Common anticholinergic medications include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diphenhydramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">atropine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scopolamine-hyoscine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">scopolamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dimenhydrinate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dimenhydrinate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpheniramine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chlorpheniramine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyoscyamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hyoscyamine</a>, and symptoms may occur even at standard therapeutic dosages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-department-evaluation-of-acute-onset-psychosis-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Typical and atypical antipsychotic medications also have anticholinergic activity and can produce anticholinergic toxicity in overdose. Recreational use of anticholinergic medications and plants (eg, Datura stramonium [Jimson weed], Datura inoxia [Moonflower], Brugmansia species [Angel's trumpet]) with severe psychotic symptoms, including paranoia, delusions of persecution, and visual hallucinations has been reported among adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-department-evaluation-of-acute-onset-psychosis-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Other signs of anticholinergic toxicity include, mydriasis, dry mucus membranes, lack of diaphoresis, urinary retention, decreased bowel sounds, hypertension, tachycardia, and hyperthermia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71268 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anticholinergic-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anticholinergic poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sympathomimetic toxicity</strong> &ndash; A wide range of sympathomimetic substances, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudoephedrine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">pseudoephedrine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextroamphetamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dextroamphetamine</a>, MDMA (&quot;ecstasy&quot;), amphetamine, methamphetamine, and cocaine have been associated with psychosis in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-department-evaluation-of-acute-onset-psychosis-in-children/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. While these substances exacerbate existing psychosis in patients with psychiatric disease, they may also produce new psychotic symptoms in patients with no prior history of mental illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-department-evaluation-of-acute-onset-psychosis-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Psychosis from sympathomimetic agents is typically accompanied by characteristic findings of hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, mydriasis, and diaphoresis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71268 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-acute-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine: Acute intoxication&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methamphetamine-acute-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methamphetamine: Acute intoxication&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mdma-ecstasy-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;MDMA (ecstasy) intoxication&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hallucinogens</strong> &ndash; Adolescents may intentionally experiment with these agents to experience hallucinations, while young children may come into contact with them unintentionally. Commonly abused agents include lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), phencyclidine (PCP), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextromethorphan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dextromethorphan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a>, and salvia divinorum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">LSD remains the prototypical hallucinogen and the most extensively studied of such drugs. LSD users report a wide variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms, including:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Distortions of time perception</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Visual illusions (eg, unusually vivid or distorted objects and intense colors)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Euphoria and feelings of expansiveness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Depersonalization</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blending of the senses (synesthesia)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">While intoxicated, most individuals remain oriented and aware that their experiences are drug-induced. Signs of sympathetic stimulation are common but generally mild, and may include tachycardia, hypertension, mydriasis, piloerection, and diaphoresis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intoxication-from-lsd-and-other-common-hallucinogens\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intoxication from LSD and other common hallucinogens&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextromethorphan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Dextromethorphan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a>, and phencyclidine (PCP) belong to a class of hallucinogens known as dissociative agents that act as antagonists at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor; NMDA receptor hypofunction has been postulated as one neurochemical mechanism of psychosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-department-evaluation-of-acute-onset-psychosis-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intoxication-from-lsd-and-other-common-hallucinogens\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intoxication from LSD and other common hallucinogens&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextromethorphan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Dextromethorphan</a> is the most widely available of the dissociative agents, and its recreational misuse is growing among adolescents. Patients intoxicated with dextromethorphan may display euphoria, tachycardia, diaphoresis, hallucinations, agitation, and hyperthermia. Frank psychosis due to dextromethorphan has also been reported. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextromethorphan-abuse-and-poisoning-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dextromethorphan abuse and poisoning: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Initially developed as a field anesthetic for military purposes, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a> has been a widely used recreational drug since the 1970s. Ketamine abuse is closely associated worldwide with the use of other &quot;club drugs&quot; including &quot;ecstasy&quot; (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine or MDMA), gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), and methamphetamine, often in the setting of large dance parties known as raves. Ketamine produces visual and auditory hallucinations. In addition, ketamine may cause nystagmus, hyperthermia, hypertension, and tachycardia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ketamine poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Phencyclidine (PCP) can induce acute schizophrenia in adolescents, including agitation, memory loss, psychosis, audio-visual hallucinations, and paranoid delusions. Acute brain syndrome, characterized by confusion, disorientation, poor judgment, and amnesia is seen in approximately one third of patients. Recovery from psychosis can take weeks to months. Other clinical features include horizontal, vertical, or rotatory nystagmus, violent behavior, and decreased pain response. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Salvia divinorum is a perennial herb of the mint family that is gaining popularity among adolescents and young adults because of its easy availability. Plants, leaves, and extracts are available for purchase over the internet, where it is marketed as a legal and safe hallucinogen on many websites. Unlike many of the other hallucinations, Salvinorin A, the psychoactive component of Salvia divinorum, displays no serotonergic activity. Instead, Salvinorin A is a potent kappa-opioid receptor agonist, provoking dysphoria, synesthesia, and visual hallucinations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intoxication-from-lsd-and-other-common-hallucinogens#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intoxication from LSD and other common hallucinogens&quot;, section on 'Salvia divinorum'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Marijuana</strong> &ndash; Marijuana exposure has also been reported to cause psychotic symptoms either alone or when adulterated with PCP and smoked. There is also evidence that marijuana alone may precipitate schizophreniform symptoms in patients with preexisting risk factors for psychiatric disease. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Drug-related syndromes</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Serotonin syndrome</strong> &ndash; Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with increased serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) that may be mistaken for psychosis. Mental status changes can include anxiety, agitated delirium, restlessness, and disorientation. In addition, patients often exhibit autonomic manifestations (eg, diaphoresis, tachycardia, hyperthermia, hypertension) and neuromuscular hyperactivity (eg, hyperreflexia, clonus, lower extremity rigidity). It is seen with therapeutic medication use, inadvertent interactions between drugs, and intentional self-poisoning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serotonin syndrome (serotonin toxicity)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Baclofen</a><strong> withdrawal</strong> &ndash; Baclofen withdrawal may be seen in children with cerebral palsy or spinal cord injury who are receiving intrathecal baclofen to treat spasticity. Pump emptying or malfunction can precipitate signs of baclofen withdrawal, including hallucinations, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension or hypotension, and rigidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-department-evaluation-of-acute-onset-psychosis-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Baclofen withdrawal must be considered in any child with a history of chronic baclofen exposure who presents with symptoms of psychosis. The resulting muscle rigidity and hyperthermia may require emergent treatment with baclofen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> endotracheal intubation with neuromuscular paralysis. Left untreated, the muscle rigidity accompanying baclofen withdrawal may lead to rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia, severe lactic acidosis, hepatic injury, renal failure, and death.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Benzodiazepine (sedative) withdrawal</strong> &ndash; Withdrawal syndromes are an important and potentially life-threatening cause of psychosis in children receiving benzodiazepines and other sedatives chronically during pediatric intensive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-department-evaluation-of-acute-onset-psychosis-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Central nervous system stimulation with hallucinations and seizures may occur if unrecognized. Tapering of intravenous dose and, when possible, switching to oral administration are therapeutic options to prevent withdrawal in these patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benzodiazepine poisoning and withdrawal&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)</strong> &ndash; NMS is a rare syndrome in children receiving typical and atypical neuroleptic agents. It is characterized by fever, rigidity, and altered mental status (eg, agitated delirium, confusion, mutism, or catatonia). While symptoms usually develop during the first two weeks of neuroleptic therapy, the association of NMS with drug use is idiosyncratic. NMS can occur after a single dose. Complications include rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, and death. Treatment of this condition requires rapid recognition, aggressive cooling measures, including intubation and paralysis for extreme hyperthermia, and dopaminergic agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">bromocriptine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amantadine</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroleptic malignant syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Drug-induced psychosis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Steroid-induced psychosis</strong> &ndash; Steroid-induced psychosis is a well-known complication of glucocorticoid therapy in adults, and has been reported in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-department-evaluation-of-acute-onset-psychosis-in-children/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In many cases, withdrawal of the steroid is sufficient to reverse psychosis, but some patients may require a brief course of antipsychotic medication, particularly when the steroid cannot be stopped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-department-evaluation-of-acute-onset-psychosis-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Response to antipsychotic drug treatment is typically complete and occurs within two weeks of initiation of neuroleptics. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who are on higher doses of corticosteroids present a particular problem, since it is often difficult to differentiate psychosis due to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> from neuropsychiatric lupus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;, section on 'Neuropsychiatric effects'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuropsychiatric-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuropsychiatric manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Isoniazid-induced psychosis</strong> &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Isoniazid</a> (INH)-induced psychosis is a rare complication of antituberculous therapy that has been reported widely in patients who have no prior psychiatric history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-department-evaluation-of-acute-onset-psychosis-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Symptoms of psychosis typically begin days to weeks after initiation of INH therapy. The mechanism of INH induced psychosis has been not been completely elucidated; however, pyridoxine has not been shown to prevent or treat the psychosis symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-department-evaluation-of-acute-onset-psychosis-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antibiotic-induced mania</strong> &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Amoxicillin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clarithromycin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">erythromycin</a> have rarely caused neuropsychiatric symptoms including anxiety and hallucinations.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and emergency management of the acutely agitated or violent adult&quot;, section on 'Benzodiazepines'</a>.)</p><p>The typical antipsychotic agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">haloperidol</a> (dose 0.025 to 0.075 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose, maximum: 5 mg) is an alternative to benzodiazepine sedation in the acutely psychotic child or adolescent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-department-evaluation-of-acute-onset-psychosis-in-children/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. The onset of antipsychotic activity for most neuroleptic agents is delayed on the order of days. However, the sedating properties of neuroleptics often aid in the management of the agitated patient. Many of the severe adverse effects associated with neuroleptics tend to occur in chronic dosing, including pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, extrapyramidal symptoms, and agranulocytosis. However, serious side effects may occur acutely, including dystonia, hypotension, and electrocardiographic interval prolongation. Children may be at greater risk of developing dystonia than adults. The clinician should also be vigilant for manifestations of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
