Most outbreaks occur during the tropical rainy season and abate during the dry season. However, outbreaks in Africa have occurred after periods of drought, where open water containers serve as vector-breeding sites.</p><p>Chikungunya can cause large outbreaks with high attack rates, affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. An outbreak on R&eacute;union Island in 2005 to 2006 involved approximately 266,000 individuals (34 percent of the island's population) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Chikungunya is transmitted by the mosquito vectors <em>Aedes aegypti</em> and <em>Aedes albopictus</em>. Infected travelers can import chikungunya into new areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/1,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6</a>]; in areas with <em>Ae. aegypti</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <em>Ae. albopictus</em> mosquitoes, local transmission can follow. This has been described in many Asian and European countries as well as in the Americas and Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/7-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-14</a>].</p><p>Chikungunya was perceived as a tropical disease until an outbreak in Italy occurred in 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The first locally acquired cases of chikungunya in the Americas were reported in 2013 on islands in the Caribbean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Since then, chikungunya virus infections have spread widely in the Caribbean and Americas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/1,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16</a>]. The first cases of local transmission in the continental United States were reported in Florida in July 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]; local transmission has been reported widely in Puerto Rico, where serosurveys found nearly 25 percent of blood donors had been infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Dengue and Zika viruses are transmitted by the same mosquito vectors as chikungunya. The viruses can co-circulate in a geographic region, and coinfections have been documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chikungunya virus may be transmitted via the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mosquito bites</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rarely via maternal-fetal transmission</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rarely via blood products and organ transplantation</p><p/><p>Chikungunya virus is transmitted to people primarily via mosquito bites. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on a person already infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other people via biting, after the virus reaches the mosquito salivary glands.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Mosquito transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In endemic areas of Africa, chikungunya virus transmission occurs in cycles involving humans, <em>Aedes</em> and other mosquitoes, and animals (nonhuman primates and perhaps other animals). Outside Africa, major outbreaks are sustained by mosquito transmission among susceptible humans. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p>The major chikungunya virus mosquito vectors are <em>Ae. aegypti</em> and <em>Ae. albopictus</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F106382\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106382 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F107582\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107582 \">figure 2</a>); they bite primarily during the day but also at night. These mosquito vectors are also capable of transmitting Zika virus and dengue virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zika-virus-infection-an-overview#H257719777\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zika virus infection: An overview&quot;, section on 'Transmission'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dengue virus infection: Epidemiology&quot;, section on 'Transmission cycle'</a>.)</p><p><em>Ae. aegypti</em> is well adapted to urban settings and is widely distributed in the tropics and subtropics worldwide. It prefers the human host and breeds readily in flowerpots and in trash. A single <em>Ae. aegypti</em> mosquito can infect more than one human since this species may feed on another host if its blood meal is interrupted.</p><p><em>Ae. albopictus</em> (known as the Asian tiger mosquito) can survive more temperate environments than <em>Ae. aegypti</em> so has a wider potential distribution. It has been considered a relatively inefficient vector since it bites a range of animal species, and blood meals from nonsusceptible hosts do not contribute to virus transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, some populations of <em>Ae. albopictus</em> may be more anthropophilic (ie, preferring human blood) than others; in some settings, humans may be the most abundant host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. <em>Ae. albopictus</em> is competent to transmit a number of arboviruses (including yellow fever, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and Eastern equine encephalitis viruses).</p><p>Chikungunya virus can spread geographically via travel of infected individuals between regions with appropriate <span class=\"nowrap\">season/climate</span> where competent mosquitoes exist for perpetuation of local transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, dissemination of mosquitoes can occur via transport of mosquito larvae and eggs by ships and air traffic to new areas with suitable environmental and climatic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>In general, the warmer the temperature, the shorter the extrinsic incubation period (the period between a mosquito blood meal from a viremic host and the transmission of virus to a new host), and the sooner the mosquito can transmit virus to a new host. In cool temperatures in temperate areas, a mosquito may die before the extrinsic incubation period is complete. In addition, mutations in some strains of the chikungunya virus may shorten the extrinsic incubation period, allowing more mosquitoes to survive long enough to transmit virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/1,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,27-29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Blood products and organ transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transmission of chikungunya via blood products has been described in France, where a nurse was infected by exposure to blood while caring for a patient infected in R&eacute;union [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>].</p><p>Transmission via organ transplantation could also occur since chikungunya viremia (may exceed 10<sup>9</sup> RNA <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> plasma) is likely prior to onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/9,19,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,19,30</a>].</p><p>Chikungunya virus infects the human cornea and might be transmitted via corneal grafts. Infected corneas have been documented in individuals in the absence of systemic manifestations of chikungunya infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1932698220\"><span class=\"h3\">Maternal-fetal transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women infected with chikungunya virus are not at increased risk for atypical or severe disease. Maternal-fetal transmission of chikungunya virus has been described, and maternal chikungunya virus infection has been associated with miscarriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>The risk of maternal-fetal transmission is highest when pregnant women are symptomatic during the intrapartum period (two days before delivery to two days after delivery). During this period, vertical transmission occurs in approximately half of cases; among 39 women in the R&eacute;union outbreak with viremia at the time of delivery, the rate of vertical transmission was 49 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Cesarean delivery was not protective against vertical transmission. (See <a href=\"#H1539861928\" class=\"local\">'Neonatal infection'</a> below.)</p><p>Chikungunya virus has not been detected in breast milk, and transmission of chikungunya virus via breastfeeding has not been reported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1921522517\"><span class=\"h2\">Adults and children with postnatal infection</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following an incubation period of 3 to 7 days (range 1 to 14 days), clinical manifestations begin abruptly with fever and malaise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The majority of infected individuals have symptoms; asymptomatic seroconversion occurs in less than 15 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/1,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,30</a>].</p><p>Fever may be high grade (&gt;39&ordm;C); the usual duration of fever is 3 to 5 days (range 1 to 10 days). Polyarthralgia begins two to five days after onset of fever and commonly involves multiple joints (often 10 or more joint groups) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/7,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,35-37</a>]. Arthralgia is usually bilateral and symmetric and involves distal joints more than proximal joints. Affected joints include hands (50 to 76 percent), wrists (29 to 81 percent), and ankles (41 to 68 percent). Involvement of the axial skeleton was noted in 34 to 52 percent of cases. Pain may be intense and disabling, leading to immobilization.</p><p>Skin manifestations have been reported in 40 to 75 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/35,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,37</a>]. The most common skin manifestation is macular or maculopapular rash (usually appearing three days or later after onset of illness and lasting three to seven days). The rash often starts on the limbs and trunk, can involve the face, and may be patchy or diffuse. Pruritus has been reported in 25 to 50 percent of patients in some series.</p><p>Additional manifestations may include headache, myalgia, facial puffiness, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Atypical dermatologic manifestations include bullous skin lesions (described most often in children) and hyperpigmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. External ear redness may reflect chondritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Hemorrhagic manifestations are uncommon.</p><p>On physical examination, periarticular edema or swelling has been observed in 32 to 95 percent of cases. In one series, large joint effusions were noted in 15 percent of cases. Peripheral lymphadenopathy (most often cervical) may be present (9 to 41 percent of cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/8,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,40</a>]. Conjunctivitis may be observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The most common laboratory abnormalities are lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Hepatic transaminases and creatinine may be elevated. High viral load during the acute illness was associated with poor prognosis in the post-acute phase in a large series in India [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>The duration of acute illness is usually 7 to 10 days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4064799535\"><span class=\"h3\">Severe complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe complications and death have been reported during chikungunya outbreaks. Severe complications and death occur more often among patients older than 65 years and patients with underlying chronic medical problems (eg, most commonly diabetes and cardiovascular disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/1,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,43</a>].</p><p>Severe complications include respiratory failure, cardiovascular decompensation, myocarditis, acute hepatitis, renal failure, hemorrhage, and neurologic involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Meningoencephalitis is the most common neurologic complication; other neurologic manifestations include acute flaccid paralysis, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, myelitis, and cranial nerve palsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>].</p><p>Ocular manifestations (iridocyclitis, retinitis, episcleritis, macular choroiditis, uveitis) and sensorineural hearing loss have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/41,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,49,50</a>]. One report described extensive skin necrosis of the nose in three severely ill adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In R&eacute;union, the estimated incidence of severe disease (eg, hospitalized patients with complications, such as respiratory failure, meningoencephalitis, acute hepatitis, or kidney failure) was 17 per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/4,48,52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,48,52,53</a>].</p><p>Deaths associated with chikungunya virus infection were reported during outbreaks in Mauritius, R&eacute;union, and India [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/52,54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,54-56</a>]. In R&eacute;union, there were 228 deaths; the mean age was 78 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. During the chikungunya epidemic in Ahmedabad, India, in 2006, about 60,000 cases were described; the number of deaths during the four months of peak epidemic activity exceeded the average death rate during those months in the previous four years by almost 3000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H810986770\"><span class=\"h3\">Persistent or relapsed disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients have persistence or relapse of signs and symptoms in the months following acute illness; manifestations include <span class=\"nowrap\">arthritis/arthralgia,</span> edematous polyarthritis of fingers and toes, morning pain and stiffness, and severe tenosynovitis (especially of wrists, hands, and ankles) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Carpal tunnel syndromes may result from hypertrophic tenosynovitis. In addition, patients may report joint or bone pain at sites of previous injury. Occasionally, sternoclavicular or temporomandibular joints are involved. New-onset Raynaud phenomena in the second or third month following infection have been described in up to 20 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Cryoglobulinemia has also been found in patients with persistent symptoms attributed to chikungunya infection (&gt;90 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Chronic manifestations usually involve joints affected during the acute illness and can be relapsing or unremitting and incapacitating. Patients may develop a new chronic inflammatory polyarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>] or may have flares of preexisting joint conditions (whether noninflammatory, mechanical, or inflammatory) during and following infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In one systematic review including approximately 5700 patients with chikungunya virus infection, about 25 to 35 percent of patients developed chronic joint symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Of these, approximately half of patients developed chronic inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis, nonspecific post-viral polyarthritis, or seronegative spondylitis); other manifestations included arthralgia and other musculoskeletal pain conditions (eg, fibromyalgia, frozen shoulder, and plantar fasciitis).</p><p>The duration of symptoms is variable. As an example, among 47 patients with acute chikungunya fever followed in Marseilles, France, 82 percent had persistent joint symptoms. At one, three, and six months following acute illness, symptoms persisted in 88, 86, and 48 percent of patients, respectively; at 15 months, 4 percent remained symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In contrast, among 88 patients in R&eacute;union evaluated a mean of 18 months after confirmation of acute chikungunya infection, 63 percent reported persistent polyarthralgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Morning stiffness was reported by 75 percent of individuals, and almost half reported that the pain had a negative impact on daily activities. Another study of 180 patients from R&eacute;union with viremic chikungunya virus infection found that, at 36 months, 60 percent still had arthralgias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. One study in South Africa reported arthralgia three years after the acute illness in 12 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1539861928\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonatal infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical manifestations among neonates in the R&eacute;union outbreak were observed within three to seven days after delivery and included fever, poor feeding, rash, and peripheral edema; 89 percent had thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chikungunya-fever/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Some infants developed neurologic disease (eg, meningoencephalitis, cerebral edema, and intracranial hemorrhage) or myocardial disease.

Arthralgia is usually bilateral and symmetric and involves distal joints more than proximal joints. The most common skin manifestation is macular or maculopapular rash (usually appearing three days or later after onset of illness and lasting three to seven days). Additional manifestations may include headache, myalgia, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Severe complications (including meningoencephalitis, cardiopulmonary decompensation, acute renal failure, and death) have been described with greater frequency among patients older than 65 years and those with underlying chronic medical problems.
