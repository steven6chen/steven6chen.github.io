Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p>Not everyone who is treated with chemotherapy will get mouth sores. It depends on the chemotherapy medicines and doses you get. When mouth sores happen, they usually start shortly after the chemotherapy starts. They are often worst about 1 week after the chemotherapy starts.</p><p>Another cancer treatment, called radiation therapy, can also cause mouth sores. Mouth sores happen only when people are treated with radiation to their head or neck. Mouth sores usually happen within the first 2 to 3 weeks of radiation therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261742127\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of mouth sores from cancer treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mouth sores usually start as red areas or a burning feeling in the mouth. The sores can then become raised white patches and, later on, open sores that are often painful. Mouth sores can also cause a sore throat.</p><p>A person's symptoms can be mild or severe. Some people have mouth and throat sores that are very painful. This can cause trouble swallowing and make it too painful to eat or drink.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261742142\"><span class=\"h1\">Can mouth sores be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help prevent mouth sores, see your dentist before you start cancer treatment. He or she can check your teeth and do any dental work you need.</p><p>In some cases, people can lower their chance of getting mouth sores if they chew ice chips right before their chemotherapy.</p><p>Doctors are studying other ways to prevent mouth sores. Your doctor might recommend a medicine or procedure before your cancer treatment starts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261742157\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do on my own to manage my mouth sores?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help reduce symptoms and help your mouth sores heal, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Change your diet &ndash; Try to avoid spicy, salty, or dry foods, or foods with sharp edges (like chips) that could cut your mouth.
