About one-half of these cases are diagnosed prenatally, and the other half are diagnosed in the 12 months after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Cervical cancer is one of the most common malignancies in pregnancy, with an estimated incidence of 0.8 to 1.5 cases per 10,000 births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p>Most patients are diagnosed at an early stage of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. This is probably a result of routine prenatal screening, but it is also possible that advanced stage disease interferes with conception. Stage for stage, the course of disease and prognosis of cervical cancer in pregnant patients are similar to those of nonpregnant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>There are no data from large randomized trials upon which to base recommendations for the care of pregnant patients with cervical cancer. Therefore, management is based upon evidence from randomized trials in nonpregnant women, findings from observational studies of pregnant women, and the unique medical and ethical considerations underlying each individual case. Treatment should be individualized and based on the stage of cancer, the woman's desire to continue pregnancy, and the risks of modifying or delaying therapy during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical cancer is often first suspected when a screening test for the disease is abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. While they have not been studied directly, the performance characteristics of the Papanicolaou (Pap) test do not appear to differ significantly between pregnant and nonpregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Overall, the rate of significant cytological abnormalities among obstetrical patients has been reported to be 5 to 8 percent and is similar to that of the nonpregnant population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>].</p><p>Symptoms and signs of cervical carcinoma in pregnancy are dependent upon the clinical stage and lesion size. In two series, all pregnant patients with stage IA and 50 percent of those with stage IB carcinoma were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis and had their disease detected by routine cancer screening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113542\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113542 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>]. Patients with symptomatic stage IB disease presented with abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge; patients with more advanced disease also presented with pelvic pain, sciatica-type leg pain, flank pain, chronic anemia, and shortness of breath. Since many of these symptoms are similar to those associated with a normal pregnancy, the diagnosis of cervical cancer may be delayed in pregnant women. </p><p>A gross cervical lesion may be observed or palpated at any gestational age. The ability to detect early neoplasia by physical examination may be limited by normal pregnancy-associated cervical changes such as ectropion, stromal edema, and ripening. In addition, normal decidual reaction of the cervix may resemble carcinoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471209277\"><span class=\"h2\">Women with clinical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical cytology to exclude cervical cancer is part of the diagnostic evaluation of abnormal vaginal bleeding in pregnancy. Management of abnormal cytology is described below.

Bleeding, if encountered after biopsy, can be controlled with use of Monsel's solution or suturing. Endocervical curettage is not performed in pregnant women because of concern that it may disrupt the pregnancy, although there is no evidence proving an increased risk of pregnancy disruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>If colposcopy in early pregnancy is unsatisfactory, repeating the procedure in 6 to 12 weeks may result in a satisfactory examination because the transformation zone may have &quot;migrated&quot; to the ectocervix, thus allowing a satisfactory examination by 20 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Colposcopic evaluation of the cervix in pregnancy can be challenging; it should be done by a colposcopist experienced in recognizing both pregnancy-related and cancer-related cervical changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. As an example, the increased vascularity of the gestational cervix exaggerates the way immature metaplastic epithelium reacts to acetic acid, which may mimic a dysplastic lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Conversely, neoplastic cervical lesions early in pregnancy may be mistaken for the normal eversion of the squamocolumnar junction or benign cervical decidualization. The reliability of colposcopy with directed biopsy is not related to the stage of pregnancy when performed by an experienced colposcopist familiar with the changes of the cervix that occur in pregnant women. The reliability of colposcopy and biopsy in pregnancy is illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one series of 612 gravid patients with abnormal cytology, no invasive carcinoma was missed, and complications of biopsies were minimal, with only two patients experiencing preterm labor and delivery (both had undergone cone biopsies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, another study found colposcopy to have concordance, overestimation, and underestimation of the final diagnosis in 72.6, 17.6, and 9.8 percent of cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The authors also noted that the reliability of colposcopy and directed biopsy was not related to the pregnant state.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one multi-institutional study that included over 1000 women who presented with an abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) smear in pregnancy, colposcopy and subsequent biopsy were performed in 89 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Of those with a colposcopic impression that was <span class=\"nowrap\">normal/CIN</span> I (n = 27), the biopsy confirmed this in 22 (81 percent) but found CIN <span class=\"nowrap\">II/III</span> in 5 (19 percent).

As an example, one study reported persistent HSIL postpartum in all 28 patients with antepartum HSIL, three of whom were diagnosed with microinvasive carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Another study observed that HSIL regressed to normal in 53 percent, 31 percent had persistent high-grade disease, and 16 percent regressed to a lower grade lesion within six months postpartum, but about half the patients in this series were lost to follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Diagnostic conization in nonpregnant patients is performed to exclude invasive cancer when a punch biopsy shows only microinvasive disease or adenocarcinoma in situ (stage IA or microscopic IB, no clinically visible lesion) because the maximum depth of invasion can only be determined by examination of the entire lesion. In contrast, diagnostic conization is only indicated during pregnancy if confirmation of invasive disease will alter the timing or mode of delivery; otherwise, conization is postponed until the postpartum period to avoid potentially disrupting the pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cervical cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical adenocarcinoma in situ&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If prepartum conization is performed, the optimal time appears to be the second trimester, preferably between 14 and 20 weeks of gestation. Cervical conization should not be performed within four weeks of the estimated date of delivery because labor may cause the fresh conization wound to hemorrhage or extend [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the pregnant patient undergoing nonobstetric surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Technically, pregnancy-related eversion of the squamocolumnar junction facilitates the conization procedure in pregnant women. Frequently, a limited wedge biopsy is all that is needed to produce an appropriate diagnostic specimen. Some experts suggest excising a &quot;coin&quot;-shaped specimen instead of a &quot;cone&quot;- shaped specimen to limit disruption of the endocervical canal, minimize morbidities associated with blood loss, and avoid disturbing the fetal membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. If a true conization is required, one option is to perform a cone cerclage whereby a cerclage is placed immediately after the conization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Procedures for cervical conization&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transvaginal-cervical-cerclage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transvaginal cervical cerclage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Potential complications of conization during pregnancy include hemorrhage (5 to 15 percent), miscarriage, premature rupture of membranes, preterm <span class=\"nowrap\">labor/delivery,</span> and infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/20,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,25</a>]. Fetal death is uncommon. It has been reported weeks after the conization procedure and, in some cases, was attributed to chorioamnionitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The frequency of operative hemorrhage greater than 500 mL correlates with the trimester in which the procedure is performed: the risk is minimal in the first trimester, about 5 percent in the second, and about 10 percent in the third [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/21,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,27</a>]. In the largest consecutive series of cone biopsies during pregnancy (n = 180), fetal loss possibly or probably related to the procedure occurred in eight (4.5 percent) pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Three of the eight fetal losses occurred prior to 14 weeks of gestation and one to four weeks after conization. Thirteen women (7.2 percent) lost greater than 500 mL of blood, 11 of whom were in the third trimester.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471210031\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of cervical cancer is based upon histological confirmation of the disease in a cervical biopsy specimen.

Findings on computed tomographic (CT) studies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and lymphangiograms cannot be used for staging purposes, with the exception of the urogram portion. However, these studies can be helpful for treatment planning.</p><p>In pregnant women, we suggest the following approach that balances the need to obtain information for maternal management with the competing need to limit fetal exposure to ionizing radiation.

MRI has the advantage of excellent tissue contrast and depicts pelvic anatomy in three planes; therefore, it can be used to calculate tumor volume and assess spread to adjacent organs and lymph nodes. For the assessment of tumor size in nonpregnant patients, the overall accuracy of MRI is 93 percent and the negative predictive value for parametrial invasion is above 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. For small nodal metastases, the accuracy of conventional MRI in nonpregnant patients is poor; however, once nodal diameter is greater than 1 cm in short axis, the sensitivity and specificity of MRI are 62 to 89 percent and 88 to 91 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphadenectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In selected patients who desire to continue their pregnancy but are at significant risk for lymph node metastases, staging lymphadenectomy during pregnancy via extraperitoneal or laparoscopic approach may provide the most definitive information on lymph node status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>].

If termination is not performed before chemoradiation and treatment does not result in spontaneous abortion, medical or surgical uterine evacuation can be performed after chemoradiation, guided by the clinical scenario and subject to local statutes.

Therefore, women with stage IA1 and IA2 cervical cancer can proceed with a vaginal delivery, with cesarean delivery reserved for standard obstetrical indications. Episiotomy should be avoided when possible.

For women with metastatic cervical cancer in pregnancy, the management is medical and aimed at disease control, not cure.

These relationships held even in patients diagnosed with cervical cancer up to 12 months following delivery.</p><p>Of note, only one case of cervical squamous cell carcinoma with placental metastases has been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2202584355\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Most cases are identified as a result of cervical cancer screening programs. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colposcopic evaluation of the cervix in pregnancy with biopsies should be performed by colposcopists with experience in pregnancy-related changes in cervical appearance. Endocervical curettage should not be performed. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Women with abnormal cervical cytology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic conization is only indicated during pregnancy if confirmation of invasive disease will alter the timing or mode of delivery; otherwise, conization is postponed until the postpartum period to avoid potentially disrupting the pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Indications for and performance of conization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Staging examinations are modified in pregnant women to limit fetal exposure to ionizing radiation. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multidisciplinary team approach is crucial to address the complex care issues confronting a pregnant patient with cervical cancer such as termination versus continuation of pregnancy, delay of definitive treatment, mode of therapy during pregnancy, or timing and route of delivery. (See <a href=\"#H1130549890\" class=\"local\">'Management of invasive disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom preinvasive cervical cancer is diagnosed, definitive treatment should be deferred to the postpartum period. (See <a href=\"#H1130549414\" class=\"local\">'Management of preinvasive disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate, definitive treatment with termination of pregnancy, regardless of gestational age, is generally indicated if there is evidence of pathologic lymph node involvement or documented progression of disease during the pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H1130549890\" class=\"local\">'Management of invasive disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our approach to the management of women with invasive cervical cancer takes into account the wishes of the patient and her family regarding preservation of the pregnancy, the gestational age of the fetus, and the clinical stage of disease in the mother: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women who do not desire continuation of the pregnancy after the diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer, the management is similar to that of nonpregnant women. (See <a href=\"#H1667577681\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy termination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women who desire pregnancy preservation with a fetus at an early gestational age (see <a href=\"#H1130550529\" class=\"local\">'Gestational age less than 22 to 25 weeks at diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients in whom microscopic invasive disease is identified (or suspected), we perform a diagnostic conization. No further treatment is warranted if they had stage IA1 disease, provided that they had no further evidence of disease during follow-up. If the conization margin was positive, delivery by cesarean and repeat conization six to eight weeks postpartum to rule out invasive disease is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H1130550529\" class=\"local\">'Gestational age less than 22 to 25 weeks at diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients with stage IA2 and a subset of patients with stage IB1 tumors &lt;2 cm, we suggest surgical treatment with a simple trachelectomy or large conization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We suggest not performing a radical trachelectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1130550529\" class=\"local\">'Gestational age less than 22 to 25 weeks at diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients with a tumor &ge;2 cm, we suggest neoadjuvant chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We suggest the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> administered every three weeks until delivery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women who desire pregnancy preservation and whose fetus is at a later gestational age (see <a href=\"#H1130550772\" class=\"local\">'Gestational age 22 to 25 weeks or later'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>We suggest treatment delay until after delivery, provided that their tumor is &lt;2 cm in size (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1130551734\" class=\"local\">'Stage IA to IB1 tumor &lt;2 cm'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>We suggest neoadjuvant chemotherapy if their tumor is &ge;2 cm (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, other oncologists prefer termination of pregnancy and initiation of definitive treatment for these patients because of the high risk of recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H1130551740\" class=\"local\">'Stage greater than IB1 (Tumor 2 cm or larger)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy should not be administered to women with invasive cervical cancer who desire preservation of their pregnancy because it results in fetal loss or other harm. (See <a href=\"#H1667577881\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancies not terminated'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are diagnosed with cervical cancer and continue their pregnancy should be closely followed until delivery. Patients who demonstrate evidence of disease progression should undergo definitive treatment. (See <a href=\"#H109748770\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance during pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with stage IA cervical cancer, vaginal delivery is acceptable provided that they had negative margins at the time of their diagnostic conization. However, cesarean delivery should be performed for women with higher stages of disease. (See <a href=\"#H109748606\" class=\"local\">'Considerations about delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer during pregnancy should undergo definitive treatment of their disease following completion of the pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H444156096\" class=\"local\">'Definitive treatment for cervical cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No further treatment is warranted for stage IA1 disease if they desire to preserve fertility. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with stage IA2 disease or a tumor up to 4 cm in size and who desire to preserve their fertility, we proceed with a radical trachelectomy six to eight weeks after delivery. A lymphadenectomy should also be performed if not done previously. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women who do not wish to preserve fertility:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>We suggest an extrafascial hysterectomy for women with stage IA1 disease rather than a radical hysterectomy, provided there is no evidence of lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients with stage IA1 disease with LVSI, IA2, or IB1 tumors &lt;2 cm, we suggest a radical hysterectomy rather than chemoradiation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy during pregnancy for locally advanced disease or node-positive disease, we proceed with a radical hysterectomy, which can be done at the time of cesarean delivery or as a second surgical procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The definitive treatment for women diagnosed with more advanced disease during pregnancy who delayed treatment until after delivery mirrors that of the nonpregnant patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-locally-advanced-cervical-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of locally advanced cervical cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-early-stage-cervical-cancer#H57553162\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of early-stage cervical cancer&quot;, section on 'Surgical treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When controlled for stage of cervical cancer, the course of disease and prognosis of cervical cancer in pregnant women are similar to those of nonpregnant women.
