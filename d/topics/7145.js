FBS is riskier than postnatal venipuncture and interpretation of results can be difficult because of the limited availability of normative fetal laboratory values across gestation.</p><p>The techniques for FBS can also be used for intravenous administration of medication or blood products (eg, platelets, red blood cells) to the fetus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine fetal transfusion of red cells&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the general approach to diagnosis and treatment of fetal arrhythmias&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28848025\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal blood is sampled to aid in the diagnostic evaluation of fetal disorders. A major difference between FBS and venipuncture in children and adults is the relatively high degree of procedure-related risk: FBS can have lethal complications. Since evaluation of amniocytes, chorionic villi, or maternal blood can often provide similar information as fetal blood, FBS should be limited to clinical situations in which use of lower risk diagnostic procedures (amniocentesis, chorionic villous sampling, maternal blood sampling) does not provide adequate or sufficiently timely diagnostic information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The maternal abdomen is cleaned with an antibacterial solution and draped. Aseptic technique should be used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to fetal viability, FBS can be performed in a room used for sonographic examinations or in a labor room. After viability, the procedure should be performed in proximity to an operating room since an emergency cesarean delivery may be required if nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns develop during or after the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Antenatal glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We administer glucocorticoids at least 24 hours prior to diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in fetuses between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation in order to enhance fetal lung maturity, if this has not been previously documented. The <span class=\"nowrap\">risk/benefit</span> ratio of this practice has not been studied and may be difficult to assess, given the small risk of procedure-related preterm delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antenatal-corticosteroid-therapy-for-reduction-of-neonatal-respiratory-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preterm-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory/imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A sample of maternal blood is drawn before the procedure for comparison with the fetal samples that will be obtained. An obstetrical ultrasound examination is also performed to confirm fetal viability and to determine fetal position and the location of the placenta.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We place an intravenous catheter in the mother to provide easy and rapid administration of analgesics, antibiotics, and fluids, as needed, and to prepare the patient in the event of procedure-related complications necessitating emergent cesarean delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The author administers broad spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis 30 to 60 minutes prior to the procedure in an effort to minimize the risk of intraamniotic infection, which has been reported after FBS (see <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> below). No randomized trials evaluating the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in this setting have been performed. Given that FBS is a &quot;clean&quot; procedure with a low risk of infection, other centers have elected not to use antibiotic prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal local anesthesia and sedation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local anesthesia is optional for diagnostic procedures. However, it is useful for therapeutic procedures (eg, transfusions) to ease patient discomfort associated with prolonged needle insertion. Maternal sedation is not generally required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H522042623\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal paralytic drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reducing fetal movement is not routinely necessary for FBS, but can be helpful when movement is likely to dislodge the needle, such as during prolonged procedures (eg, fetal transfusion) or for accessing sites other than a cord insertion on an anterior placenta. It is important to note that a paralyzed fetus that blocks access to the cord insertion site, such as into a posterior placenta, may prevent performance of the FBS procedure. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atracurium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Atracurium</a> (0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> given intramuscularly provides paralysis for up to an hour with minimal fetal cardiovascular effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Needle guide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most real-time ultrasound machines are equipped with an on-screen template of the needle tract that is used to target the sampling site. A needle-guiding device attached to the transducer may decrease the risk of cord laceration or needle displacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], but it restricts the lateral motion of the needle and hampers the procedure if the needle needs repositioning. This problem can be resolved by removing the guiding device during the procedure, if it becomes necessary. A &quot;free-hand technique&quot; is also commonly employed because it provides flexibility for adjusting the needle path. Either technique is acceptable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Needle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 20 to 22 gauge spinal needle is generally used for FBS. Smaller bore needles prolong the period of time required to obtain fetal blood and are more difficult to manipulate because they bend. A 22 gauge needle is preferable before 24 weeks of gestation because of the small diameter of the umbilical vessels, and also when thrombocytopenia is suspected because it may reduce the risk of bleeding at the insertion site. An alternative technique involves inserting a 20 gauge needle biopsy guide into the amniotic cavity, followed by threading a 25 gauge needle through the guide and then into the umbilical vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The needle guide helps prevent bending of the smaller gauge needle and improves visualization.</p><p>The length of the needle should take into account the distance from the skin to the target segment of cord, and the possibility that intervening events, such as uterine contractions, may increase this distance. The standard length of a spinal needle is 8.9 cm (excluding the hub), but longer needles are available (up to 15 cm).</p><p>Priming the needle with sodium citrate solution or heparin immediately before the procedure helps to prevent clot formation. Modified needles with silicon coating of the bore have been shown in vitro to result in a significant increase in flow rate and lower clot formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Needles designed to optimize sonographic visualization (eg, Cook OBGYN) are also available. A clear benefit of these new designs has not been adequately demonstrated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Assistants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most operators prefer to insert the needle while holding the transducer themselves. Once the needle tip is in place, an assistant is necessary either to hold the transducer or to draw the blood samples. </p><p>Other operators prefer to be guided throughout the procedure by an assistant. A second assistant is useful to adjust the quality and size of the on-screen image during the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SAMPLING SITE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Umbilical cord blood sampling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in sampling the umbilical cord is to identify a fixed segment of the cord, preferably where the cord inserts into the placenta since the stability of the abdominal insertion site is at risk if the fetus moves. A free loop of cord can be stabilized by the uterine sidewall, but this is a less desirable alternative since stability is precarious. The major disadvantage of using the placental insertion site is the possibility of contamination by maternal blood.</p><p>FBS is easiest when the placenta is anterior; however, penetration of the placenta increases the risk of feto-maternal hemorrhage and fetal loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This is less of an issue when the placenta is posterior but, in these cases, the fetus may hamper access to the target portion of the cord. Manipulation of the maternal abdomen to move the fetus may provide better access to the sampling site under these circumstances. Alternatively, intrahepatic vein access can be attempted (see below).</p><p>It may be necessary to perform a therapeutic amniocentesis to gain access to the cord insertion in cases complicated by polyhydramnios with a posterior placenta. Oligohydramnios can also interfere with visualization of the insertion site of the cord; amnioinfusion or needling of a fixed loop of cord may overcome this difficulty. The following points are some additional insights related to the procedure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doppler color flow mapping can be used to confirm the placental cord insertion site by showing the branching of the cord vessels within the placenta.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amniocentesis, if indicated, should be done prior to cordocentesis to avoid blood contamination of the fluid specimen. After aspiration of amniotic fluid, the needle is either advanced into the cord or, in cases with an anterior placenta, withdrawn within the placental mass, reoriented, and advanced into the cord. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-amniocentesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic amniocentesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is easier and safer to sample the umbilical vein than an artery; puncture of the artery increases the incidence of bradycardia and prolongs post-procedural bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. This is especially important in cases of a single umbilical artery. The vein and artery can be distinguished by the differences in their relative sizes and assessment of waveform analysis with spectral Doppler. Correct identification of the origin of the sample (arterial versus venous) is crucial for accurate interpretation of the acid-base and oxygenation status of the fetus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upon entering the umbilical cord, the stylet is removed and fetal blood is withdrawn into a syringe attached to the hub of the needle. The syringe may be primed with a small amount of anticoagulant, such as heparin or citrate. Proper positioning of the needle can be confirmed by injection of physiological saline solution into the cord and observation of turbulent flow along the vessel. After umbilical blood flow is documented by Doppler color flow, an initial sample should be submitted for red blood cell (RBC) size determination (ie, mean corpuscular volume [MCV]) to distinguish fetal from maternal cells. If multiple samples are required, it may be helpful to attach a T-connector extension set to the hub of the needle to minimize the risk of needle dislodgement during attachment of the syringes. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Intrahepatic vein fetal blood sampling'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>After the desired samples have been obtained, the needle is withdrawn and the puncture site monitored for bleeding. If an intraumbilical vein transfusion is performed after sampling, the fetal heart rate should be monitored intermittently by interrogating an umbilical artery near the transfusion site using Doppler color flow or by assessing blood velocity waveforms by pulse Doppler. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine fetal transfusion of red cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the patient has a viable fetus, the fetal heart rate is monitored for one to two hours after the procedure using an external fetal heart rate monitor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrahepatic vein fetal blood sampling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 20 or 22 gauge needle is introduced into the fetal abdomen and aimed for the intrahepatic portion of the umbilical vein or the left portal vein. The risk of needle dislodgement (8.7 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]) can be minimized by using longer needles and, after insertion into the target, allowing the needle to move with fetal movements.</p><p>This technique has some advantages compared with cordocentesis, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of need for immediate laboratory support to confirm the fetal origin of the sample and certainty of the venous origin of the sample</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less fetomaternal hemorrhage (therefore, less risk of alloimmunization) because the placenta is avoided</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significantly less streaming (bleeding) from the sampling site compared with cordocentesis (0.8 versus 30.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ease of access to the sampling site in cases with a posterior placenta or twins</p><p/><p>This procedure is often used as a second-line approach in cases of failed cordocentesis, but some centers have started using it as first-line procedure for the reasons discussed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. The negligible risk of streaming from the sampling site makes intrahepatic vein sampling an appealing alternative to cordocentesis in cases at risk for fetal thrombocytopenia. The risk of procedure-related fetal loss ranges from 0 to 6.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]; because of the small number of series published, the risk of procedure-related fetal loss specifically in low-risk cases is not known.</p><p>No significant changes in the concentrations of liver enzymes have been noted following the procedure, which suggests minimal fetal liver injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiocentesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiocentesis has few indications due to a high rate of fetal loss (eg, 5.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. It is reserved for cases where there is a high probability of a serious fetal disorder and FBS from other sites is technically impossible or has repeatedly failed.</p><p>Ideally the needle should be introduced swiftly into the anterior thoracic wall to prevent fetal movements from interfering with the procedure. The needle should be inserted into the right ventricle, if possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">BLOOD SPECIMEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal blood samples are placed into tubes containing EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) or heparin and mixed well to prevent clotting. The appropriate tubes and minimum volume of blood required for specific studies are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77660\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77660 \">table 1</a>). The maximum volume of blood removed should not exceed 6 to 7 percent of the fetoplacental blood volume for the gestational age, which can be calculated as 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of estimated fetal weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Confirmation of fetal blood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contamination with maternal blood or amniotic fluid can alter the diagnostic value of the fetal blood specimen. Confirmation that the sample is fetal blood should be performed when FBS is performed at the placental cord insertion site, but is not necessary at the abdominal cord insertion site or with intrahepatic vein sampling or cardiocentesis since maternal contamination is not relevant. The purity of the fetal blood sample is commonly assessed using the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of red blood cells (RBC) since fetal RBCs are larger than maternal RBCs. On occasion, this parameter can be misinterpreted (eg, in the presence of some maternal hematologic disorders, such as macrocytic anemia, or after repeated fetal transfusions of blood from an adult donor). Of note, an elevated (ie, greater than 95th percentile for gestational age) MCV has been proposed as a marker for trisomy or triploidy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69845\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69845 \">table 2</a>). In a population of 267 fetuses in which the prevalence of aneuploidies was 4 percent, the sensitivity of this finding was 100 percent and the specificity ranged from 43 percent among growth restricted fetuses to 58 percent among appropriate for gestational age fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Other methods to differentiate maternal from fetal blood include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) determination</strong> &ndash; This is the best marker for detection of maternal blood contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Maternal blood contains high concentrations of this hormone, whereas fetal blood is practically devoid of it. The fetal blood:amniotic fluid:maternal blood ratio for hCG is 1:100:400. HCG determination can detect as little as 0.2 percent contamination with maternal blood or 1 percent contamination with amniotic fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemoglobin alkaline denaturation test (Apt test)</strong> &ndash; 0.1 mL of sampled blood is added to a glass tube containing alkali reagent (5 mL of water and 0.3 mL of 10 percent potassium hydroxide) and the tube is gently shaken for two minutes.

Puncture of the umbilical artery is associated with a significantly longer duration of bleeding than venipuncture (mean duration of bleeding 35 seconds) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Post-procedural bleeding appears to carry a more ominous prognosis when it occurs at less than 21 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Fetuses with defects in platelet number or function are at significant risk for potentially fatal bleeding from the puncture site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>]. Thus, it is prudent to slowly transfuse the fetus with concentrated, washed maternal (or compatible donor) platelets while awaiting the fetal platelet count when FBS is performed to diagnose a fetal platelet disorder. These platelets are usually obtained from maternal plateletpheresis to minimize the risks of transfusion-related infections with pooled donor platelets. A transfusion of 15 to 20 mL of platelet concentrate usually increases the fetal platelet count by 70,000 to 90,000, which is adequate to prevent bleeding from the cord puncture site. </p><p>Dislodgement of the needle before platelet transfusion can have fatal consequences for the fetus affected with a platelet abnormality. Because of its low risk of bleeding from the sampling site, intrahepatic vein sampling has been proposed as the optimal technique for FBS in cases of suspected fetal thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>If prenatal diagnosis is being performed for evaluation of a congenital hemostatic disorder, fresh frozen plasma should be available for fetal transfusion at the time of FBS since excessive bleeding has been reported after sampling in fetuses with bleeding diatheses, such as severe von Willebrand disease and hemophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>If continued bleeding is noted from the puncture site, options include immediate delivery, if considered safe based on gestational age, or attempts at fetal volume restoration (see <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'In-utero fetal resuscitation'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Cord hematoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cord hematoma is generally asymptomatic, but can be associated with a transient or prolonged sudden fetal bradycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].

The author does not order these tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Bradycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient fetal bradycardia is reported in 5 to 10 percent of fetuses undergoing FBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most cases resolve without intervention within five minutes. The higher incidence of bradycardia in procedures involving puncture of an umbilical artery suggests that this complication may be due to a vasovagal response caused by local vasospasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>A higher rate of bradycardia has also been noted among growth restricted fetuses compared with those appropriately grown (17 versus 4 percent). The greatest risk of bradycardia is in the growth restricted fetus with absent diastolic flow in the umbilical artery by Doppler analysis: bradycardia occurred in 21 percent of these fetuses versus 5 percent of those with normal diastolic flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The maternal risk from FBS is minimal and is mainly limited to chorioamnionitis. Infection occurs after fewer than 1 percent of procedures, but is responsible for up to 40 percent of pregnancy losses associated with FBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/8,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,35-37</a>]. We administer antibiotic prophylaxis for this reason, although the benefit of this intervention is unproven (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> above).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Failure rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cordocentesis and intrahepatic vein sampling have similar rates of failure to obtain a blood specimen (9 and 5 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. For this reason, it is useful to become familiar with both techniques, so that the appropriate technique may be chosen based upon indications and ease of access to the sampling site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of postprocedure pregnancy loss appears to be 1.4 to 1.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. This risk was best illustrated by a large cohort study in which over 5000 FBS procedures were performed to detect a karyotype abnormality or hemoglobinopathy at 16 to 22 weeks in pregnant women without medical or obstetric complications or a sonographically evident fetal anomaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Fetal loss rates in women with normal results followed until delivery were almost twofold higher than in controls matched for maternal age, parity, and gestational age at sonogram who did not undergo the procedure (1.9 versus 1.0 percent, relative risk [RR] 1.9, 95% CI 1.4-2.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>The most important risk factors for procedure-related fetal loss appear to be:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indication for the procedure &ndash; The risk of fetal loss is substantially higher in the presence of fetal abnormalities. In three reports, the total spontaneous pregnancy loss rate within two weeks of the procedure was 1 percent when FBS was performed on a normal-appearing fetus for diagnosis of genetic disorders or karyotyping, 7 to 13 percent in a fetus with structural anomalies, 9 to 14 percent among growth-restricted fetuses, and 25 to 32 percent in fetuses with nonimmune hydrops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/37,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,41,42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate operator experience &ndash; In the large cohort study described above, procedures performed by less experienced operators (defined as &lt;40 procedures) were associated with about twice as many fetal losses over the remainder of gestation as procedures performed by experienced operators (3.5 versus 1.7 percent; adjusted RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.25-3.72) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This suggests that FBS procedures should be consolidated to a few centers with adequate volume to maintain operators' experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtaining the blood sample from the fetal heart rather than from the umbilical vein.

Based on review of the literature on amniocentesis in these women, this risk is probably very low and related to viral load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The possibility of vertical transmission should be discussed with these patients. The risk of transmission may be decreased by administering appropriate antiviral medication to reduce viral load to undetectable levels, if possible, before performing the procedure and avoiding penetration of the placenta during the procedure. No specific guidelines are available; a risk-benefit analysis should be conducted for each case based on the individual&rsquo;s viral load, the indication for the procedure, and urgency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1075168959\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The large cohort study described above also noted three fetuses with late-occurring anomalies in the study group (two fetuses with hydranencephaly, one fetus with hydrocephalus) compared with one fetus with hydrocephalus in the control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Although biologically plausible that thromboembolism secondary to FBS may lead to such complications, the absolute risk of an anomaly appears small <span class=\"nowrap\">(&lt;1/1000</span> procedures). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Small for gestational age, preterm birth, and other complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The large cohort study described above also reported patients who underwent FBS and had normal results had significant increases in rates of small for gestational age neonates (6.9 versus 4.6 percent; RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.8), delivery before 37 weeks of gestation (12.7 versus 7.4 percent; RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-1.9), and delivery before 34 weeks of gestation (2.6 versus 1.3 percent; RR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4-2.5) compared with controls who did not undergo the procedure and matched for maternal age, parity, and gestational age at sonogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Logistic regression analysis showed that low experience level of the operator (ie, having performed &lt;40 cases), prolonged bleeding during the procedure (ie, for longer than one minute), penetration through the placenta, and fetal bradycardia after the procedure were independent predictors of the adverse outcomes. </p><p>Rates of premature rupture of membranes, abruption, chorioamnionitis, and hypertensive complications of pregnancy were not different between the two groups. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22520534\"><span class=\"h1\">MULTIPLE GESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Access to an optimal site for cordocentesis can be more difficult when multiple fetuses are present, and the risk of complications appears to be increased, as well. In a relatively large study comparing outcomes after midtrimester cordocentesis in 122 twin fetuses and 336 singleton controls matched for maternal age and operator experience, twins had a significantly higher frequency of fetal bradycardia (13 versus 6.0 percent) and transient bleeding from the puncture site (34.8 versus 26.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The fetal loss rate within two weeks of cordocentesis, however, was similar for both groups (1.4 versus 1.1 percent) after exclusion of pregnancies undergoing termination or feticide because of abnormal findings.</p><p>Other studies have reported an 8 to 12 percent rate of fetal loss in twin gestations undergoing fetal blood sampling (FBS), but are biased by factors such as a small number of cases, inclusion of both fetoscopy and cordocentesis procedures, and different indications for the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">IN-UTERO FETAL RESUSCITATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In-utero treatment of fetal bradycardia can be attempted before viability or to avoid an emergent cesarean delivery in a very preterm infant. The option of emergent abdominal delivery and ex-utero resuscitation is preferable in the late-preterm fetus. The following measures should be implemented in the presence of bradycardia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improve uterine perfusion and enhance fetal oxygenation by tilting the mother to the left-lateral decubitus position, increasing intravenous hydration, and administering oxygen via a mask. Maternal hypotension, if present, may be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a> (10 mg intravenously).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpate the uterus to evaluate for tetanic uterine contractions as the cause of the bradycardia. Subcutaneous or intravenous tocolytics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbutaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbutaline</a> 0.25 mg subcutaneously or atosiban 6.75 mg in 4.9 mL saline given intravenously over one minute) can be administered to the mother to relax the uterus and potentially resolve the bradycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. The operator should be aware that titanic contractions in the setting of fetal bradycardia may signal placental abruption, particularly after a technically challenging procedure involving transplacental passage of the needle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent or worsening bradycardia may be secondary to prolonged bleeding or massive fetomaternal transfusion with hypovolemic shock. Fetal volume restoration can be accomplished by injecting maternal whole blood or normal saline at a volume of 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of estimated fetal weight into a fetal umbilical vessel (preferably the vein). If the umbilical vessels cannot be accessed due to hypovolemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vasoconstriction, a cardiocentesis should be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-blood-sampling/abstract/27,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If all of the above measures fail, intracardiac administration of the inotropic agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> (1:10,000 solution at a dose of 0.1 to 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of estimated fetal weight) can be attempted and repeated every three to five minutes, as appropriate.
