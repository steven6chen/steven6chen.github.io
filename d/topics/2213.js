A breast cyst may be first identified on a clinical or self-breast examination, or as a mammographic density. Breast cysts may fluctuate in size, number, and magnitude of symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H202991655\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast cysts are influenced by hormonal function and fluctuation. Therefore, they occur during lobular development, menstrual cyclic changes, and lobular involution in premenopausal and perimenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cysts-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Breast cysts are common masses found in premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal women. In a prospective study of 2809 women at increased risk of breast cancer development, the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) 6666 protocol found that cysts were identified in 37.5 percent of all women screened, with the peak incidence between 35 and 50 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cysts-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. During this three-year screening study, cysts were identified more often in premenopausal women compared with postmenopausal women (65.1 versus 39.4 percent). Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was used by 5.4 percent (n = 73) of postmenopausal women, and 66 percent of HRT users were diagnosed with cysts.</p><p>Symptomatic and asymptomatic small cysts (microcysts) are common in young premenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cysts-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

A large or small breast cyst can be palpated as a smooth, firm, discrete, and frequently tender mass. Cysts may present as a cluster of small masses or an ill-defined mass. The texture is variable, often described as similar to a grape, water balloon, or even a hard mass. Some, but not all, cysts have a sharp distinct border and are ballotable.

A sonographically guided core biopsy is a safe and accurate technique for diagnosis of indeterminate or complex cystic breast lesions with a solid component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cysts-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. When performing a core biopsy of a complex cystic breast lesion, it is essential to target the solid component with the first needle pass. Typically, a core needle biopsy consists of three to four biopsy samples. However, if the cystic portion is punctured with the first needle pass, the cystic component may collapse, making the solid component of the lesion difficult to identify sonographically.</p><p>At the completion of all core biopsies, a metallic marker clip is deployed into the biopsy site to mark the area for future follow-up or surgical excision. If a core biopsy cannot be performed due to the position of the breast lesion or technical difficulty, a surgical biopsy with needle localization is indicated.

A cystic pattern was noted in 6512 cases.&nbsp;One of those cases was found to be malignant one year later, when an intracystic tumor was biopsied and found a microinvasive cancer (0.5 mm).&nbsp;Ninety cases found an intracystic tumor, with evaluation criteria including mass size and the <span class=\"nowrap\">depth/width</span> ratio.&nbsp;No cancer was diagnosed in this subset of patients. Most of the study subjects were &lt;40 years of age.&nbsp;</p><p>In a retrospective study, 150 patients with benign histology after ultrasound-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy for complex cystic breast lesions (BIRADS 4) were evaluated to determine the appropriate follow-up.&nbsp;This subset of patients was followed at 6, 12, and 24 months with ipsilateral ultrasound and mammography.&nbsp;Breast MRI was used rarely (n = 4) for lesions initially seen on MRI. Of the 104 lesions with available follow-up imaging (mean 34.9 months), no lesions recurred or underwent malignant transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cysts-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].&nbsp;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SUBSEQUENT BREAST CANCER RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall risk of a subsequent breast cancer is not increased for women with a history of simple breast cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cysts-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/37,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,42,43</a>].

Breast cysts can present as symptomatic gross palpable masses or as microcysts, usually found as an abnormality on an imaging exam. Cysts usually prompt women to seek medical attention because of a palpable mass or associated discomfort. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast cysts are classified according to their sonographic appearance, which helps guide clinical management. (See <a href=\"#H202993215\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Simple cysts, clustered microcysts, and cysts with thin septa are considered benign, and no intervention is needed. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) can be performed if the cyst is symptomatic (painful) or obscures adjacent breast tissue. (See <a href=\"#H100220008\" class=\"local\">'Simple cyst'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a symptomatic simple breast cyst recurs several times after aspiration, another mammogram and ultrasound should be performed to evaluate the area again. Excision is reserved for suspicious lesions or for patients who no longer desire repeat aspirations. (See <a href=\"#H100220008\" class=\"local\">'Simple cyst'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complicated cysts are rarely malignant but should be aspirated to confirm diagnosis or followed with imaging and examination every six months for two years to document stability. Image-guided FNA or biopsy is indicated if the lesion increases in size or changes in characteristics on repeat imaging. (See <a href=\"#H100220260\" class=\"local\">'Complicated cyst'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complex cysts should be biopsied, particularly those with thickened cyst walls <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> septa, and solid components. (See <a href=\"#H274795950\" class=\"local\">'Risk of malignancy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical intervention is indicated for complex cysts that are not amenable to core needle biopsy and when pathology results from a core biopsy are discordant, atypical, indeterminate, or reveal a malignancy.
