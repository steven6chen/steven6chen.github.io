Furthermore, they can maintain remission in approximately 75 percent of patients. Topical therapies also provide a quicker response time than oral preparations and typically require less frequent dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>5-ASA agents are widely available as suppositories or enemas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86774\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86774 \">table 1</a>). 5-ASA foam and gel preparations, available in many countries around the world, are not available in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

A meta-analysis of seven trials concluded that 5-ASA enemas were significantly superior to corticosteroid enemas for the induction of remission and improving endoscopic and histologic severity (odds ratio [OR] 2.4, 1.9, and 2.0, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A second meta-analysis concluded that the efficacy and side effect profile of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesalamine-mesalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mesalamine</a> were dose-dependent and superior to oral therapies and topical steroids. Topical 5-ASA therapy was also associated with lower overall patient costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The side effects of 5-ASA medications are discussed separately.<em> </em>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-and-5-aminosalicylates-in-the-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sulfasalazine and 5-aminosalicylates in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with mild to moderate disease confined to the distal 5 to 8 cm of rectum, we recommend treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesalamine-mesalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mesalamine</a> suppository twice daily (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86774\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86774 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

However, this strategy is supported by limited evidence from one controlled trial in which patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beclomethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beclomethasone</a> dipropionate and 5-ASA enemas had higher rates of clinical, histologic, and endoscopic improvement after four weeks of treatment compared with patients who used single-agent therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who do not have an adequate response to topical therapy should be treated with the combination of oral 5-ASA and topical 5-ASA enemas or suppositories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86774\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86774 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/abstract/27,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,33</a>].
