Over one million adults with CHD are now living in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-arrhythmias-including-av-block-in-congenital-heart-disease/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]; up to half having undergone at least one open heart surgical procedure resulting in one or more residual atrial scars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-arrhythmias-including-av-block-in-congenital-heart-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. For the purposes of this topic, CHD does not include bicuspid valves.</p><p>As a consequence of both the added longevity and the atrial scarring from surgical procedures, atrial arrhythmias are increasingly recognized in this group. They are a major cause of hospital admission and morbidity in patients with CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-arrhythmias-including-av-block-in-congenital-heart-disease/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. These rhythm abnormalities may be poorly tolerated and are associated with an almost 50 percent increase in mortality compared with those patients without atrial arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-arrhythmias-including-av-block-in-congenital-heart-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Although all forms of atrial bradycardia and tachycardia can adversely affect patients with CHD, there are particular considerations in this group because of the anatomy and prior surgical repairs. Although some arrhythmias are intrinsic to the cardiac maldevelopment itself, most are secondary to surgical scars and chronic hemodynamic burden.</p><p>This review will focus on the management of these arrhythmias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64292\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64292 \">table 1</a>), which should involve a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H181202953\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE AND INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excluding bicuspid aortic valve, around 1 percent of infants are born with congenital heart disease (CHD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78627\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78627 \">table 2</a>), with minor reported racial differences in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-arrhythmias-including-av-block-in-congenital-heart-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Many of the congenital cardiac lesions (45 percent) are classified as simple forms, such as atrial septal defects (ASD) and ventricular septal defects (VSD); moderate forms of CHD such as tetralogy of Fallot occur less commonly, and complex CHD occurs infrequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-arrhythmias-including-av-block-in-congenital-heart-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

It may originate from atrial tissue within the Fontan circuit, from the atrial appendages, or adjacent to the pulmonary veins.

(See <a href=\"#H181202953\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence and incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity in patients with CHD and can be precipitated by cardiac residua. They can also cause hemodynamic deterioration. For this reason, it is imperative that a comprehensive clinical and hemodynamic assessment be undertaken as part of the initial work-up. (See <a href=\"#H181202953\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence and incidence'</a> above and <a href=\"#H181203047\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CHD patients with atrial arrhythmias should be referred to centers that routinely care for CHD patients, as recommended in the 2015 American Heart Association scientific statement on &quot;Congenital heart disease in the older adult&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-arrhythmias-including-av-block-in-congenital-heart-disease/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bradycardia can be inherent to the CHD anomaly; however, it is more commonly seen secondary to operative disruption of these structures. This can occur in both the early postoperative period or later due to fibrosis. (See <a href=\"#H181202968\" class=\"local\">'Bradycardias'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stroke is common in this group, and atrial arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and intra-atrial re-entrant tachycardia should prompt the clinician to consider long-term oral anticoagulation. (See <a href=\"#H181203179\" class=\"local\">'Anticoagulation therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for permanent pacing in CHD are similar to those in acquired heart disease. All symptomatic sinus or atrioventricular node disease requires pacemaker intervention. (See <a href=\"#H181203142\" class=\"local\">'Permanent pacemaker implantation'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-arrhythmias-including-av-block-in-congenital-heart-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Marelli AJ, Mackie AS, Ionescu-Ittu R, et al.
