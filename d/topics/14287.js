This topic discusses one such patient group: asymptomatic individuals who are found to have a previously undiagnosed myocardial infarction (MI). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1583177985\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to the Third Universal Definition of MI, a silent MI is defined in an asymptomatic patient by new electrocardiogram Q wave criteria for MI or evidence of MI on cardiac imaging, which are not directly attributable to a coronary revascularization procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Prior MI'</a>.)</p><p>The term &quot;previously undiagnosed&quot; MI is used synonymously to describe either a &quot;silent&quot; MI, when no symptoms are recalled by the patient, or an &quot;unrecognized&quot; MI in a patient who, despite experiencing atypical symptoms related to their MI, did not seek medical attention at that time as they did not recognize their symptoms to be harmful. The literature has used both of these terms interchangeably over the last few decades. In either case, owing to a lack of classic symptoms, there is an invariable delay in diagnosis and treatment of these patients, and often the MI will go undiscovered for months or even years. </p><p>Patients who present with symptoms or late complications of a &quot;missed&quot; MI (a term that refers to an individual with chest pain that is inappropriately managed as a noncardiac cause and subsequently found to have sustained an acute MI within the next 24 to 48 hours) represent a different patient cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The approach to these patients is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-acute-management-of-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the acute management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-non-acute-management-of-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the non-acute management of ST elevation myocardial infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-acute-management-of-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the acute management of non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-non-acute-management-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the non-acute management of unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2065986561\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two principal clinical scenarios in which a previously undiagnosed MI might be suspected. This diagnosis is most commonly associated with the finding of an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) with significant abnormalities, usually pathological Q waves, discovered incidentally during a routine health checkup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Persistent ST-segment and T wave ECG abnormalities, though less specific for MI than Q waves, can also be signs of prior MI in asymptomatic patients. In this scenario, ECG patterns suggestive of prior MI are often identified by ECG machines with automated interpretation (eg, &quot;cannot exclude anterior MI&quot;). </p><p>Previously undiagnosed MIs might also be detected by cardiac imaging. For example, this diagnosis could be inferred by the presence of regional wall motion abnormalities observed incidentally on an echocardiogram (obtained for a different reason) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Similarly, myocardial scarring detected by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F111923\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111923 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] or an irreversible perfusion defect found on myocardial perfusion scanning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] are additional findings that can be unexpected. An initial noninvasive imaging strategy is recommended for many patients with suspected stable coronary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. We predict that in the future, as more tests are performed, incidental detection of previously undiagnosed MIs by cardiac imaging is likely to become an increasingly common occurrence. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1902868591\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not uncommon for prior undiagnosed MIs to be found in otherwise asymptomatic patients in community or outpatient settings. Observational studies conducted primarily in white men between 1976 and 1998 estimated between 20 to 40 percent of MIs are unrecognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. For example, in a Framingham analysis (1990), unrecognized MI represented 30 percent of all infarctions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Studies of the Reykjavik cohort demonstrated that 35 percent of MIs in men and 33 percent of MIs in women escaped clinical detection, with a prevalence of &gt;5 percent in individuals aged 75 to 79 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Similarly, in the Honolulu Heart study, one-third of all Q wave MIs were clinically unrecognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In the Bronx Aging Study, which evaluated individuals at least 75 years of age, 43.5 percent of MIs were clinically unrecognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>More contemporary population-based cohort studies, performed after 2000, confirm that up to one-fifth of MIs defined by electrocardiograph (ECG) Q wave criteria are clinically undetected. In the Cardiovascular Health study (2000), 901 of the 5888 (15.3 percent) participants, who were all &ge;65 years of age, had ECG evidence of prior MI at baseline, of which 201 (22.3 percent) were classified as clinically unrecognized MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In the ICELAND MI study (2012), the prevalence of unrecognized MI by ECG criteria in a community dwelling cohort of older individuals in Iceland was 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Isolated minor Q waves were also present in 377 of 6551 (5.8 percent) individuals in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study (2013) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study (2002), where serial ECGs were reviewed before and after incident MIs diagnosed by hospital records in patients aged 45 to 65 years, showed that 20 percent of incident MIs were unrecognized, with African Americans having a slightly higher incidence than whites (23 versus 19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Many MI patients do not develop Q waves or indeed any other persistent ECG abnormalities. In fact, up to 20 percent of patients with nonrecurrent MI have been noted to have normal ECGs four years after their event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Thus, a highly sensitive imaging modality such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) has the potential to identify more undiagnosed MIs than screening with ECG. When compared with CMR, the overall sensitivity of Q wave ECG criteria for MI is roughly 50 percent, despite its high specificity of 85 to 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Of 936 individuals studied in ICELAND-MI, 157 (17 percent) had unrecognized MI diagnosed by CMR, which was significantly higher than the 46 (5 percent) detected by ECG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Similarly, the prevalence of CMR-detected unrecognized MI was 20 percent in another study of 259 selected 70-year-olds in Sweden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Myocardial scarring was also reported in 146 of 1840 (8 percent) individuals in the MESA cohort who underwent CMR with LGE at year 10 of follow-up, of which 114 (78 percent) were undetectable by ECG or clinical adjudication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In contrast to the high prevalence of CMR-detected MI in unselected older adult populations, perhaps unsurprisingly, undiagnosed MI was found to be very low (0.2 percent) in a study of 5000 middle-age patients without prior cardiovascular disease and with low- to intermediate-risk scores who underwent CMR imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3178836588\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL RISK PREDICTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several clinical risk factors have been associated with an increased likelihood of undiagnosed MI. Older age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], female gender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>], hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], and diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] are all associated with atypical MI symptoms, providing at least theoretical rationale that presence of these clinical factors might help predict which patients are more likely to have undiagnosed MI. Whether or not significant clinical benefit is gained from routine ECG screening for unrecognized MI in asymptomatic patients with clinical cardiovascular risk factors remains to be determined. </p><p>While it remains unclear why some patients with MI do not experience overt chest pain, it is likely that silent myocardial ischemia results from several mechanisms in these individuals, including autonomic dysfunction, abnormalities in afferent pain gating mechanisms, and central factors leading to altered pain perception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/33-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-37</a>].

In the Reykjavik study discussed above, the prevalence of unrecognized MI increased steeply after age 60 years; it was 0.5 percent at age 50 years and exceeded 5 percent at age 75 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1431697993\"><span class=\"h2\">Sex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sex-based differences have also been reported in some studies. Data from ARIC and ICELAND-MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>], published in 2016, as well as the Rotterdam study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] showed that undetected MI was more common in men than women, a finding that contrasts earlier reports where either no sex difference was observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] or increased prevalence was seen in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1282689552\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although hypertension has been identified as an independent risk factor for undiagnosed MI in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/12,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,42</a>], this relationship has not been consistently observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>]. In a study that directly compared risk factors in older adult patients with unrecognized MI versus recognized MI, age, female gender, and hypertension were all significant predictors of unrecognized MI (odd ratios 1.18, 1.45, and 1.06, respectively, p&lt;0.05 for all) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H355780327\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic kidney disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of MI has also been shown to be increased in patients with chronic kidney disease and microalbuminuria compared with those without [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In the Irebesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial, 14 percent of all first nonfatal MIs were clinically unrecognized in patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and nephropathy during a mean follow-up of 2.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1739600277\"><span class=\"h2\">Diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetes mellitus is an important clinical risk factor for undiagnosed MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The prevalence of unrecognized Q wave MI at baseline in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosiglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rosiglitazone</a> Evaluated For Cardiac Outcomes and Regulation of Glycaemia in Diabetes (RECORD) study was 1.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>] and, similarly, in the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study, the prevalence was 2.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. A slightly higher prevalence of silent MIs detected by ECG criteria were observed in diabetic patients in the Fremantle cohort from Australia at 4 percent, which amounted to 44 percent of all Q wave MIs in this study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, 17.5 percent of diabetic patients had Q waves identified on their ECG at baseline, rising to 30 percent at 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]; however, the ECG criteria used in this study might not have been specific enough to exclude a high proportion of false positives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Undiagnosed MI also appears to be more common in patients with impaired fasting glucose compared with those with normal fasting glucose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], and diabetes mellitus has been identified as an independent predictor of silent MI in patients referred for myocardial perfusion imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, among patients with type 2 diabetes, no clinical factor significantly increased the odds ratio for silent versus clinically recognized MI in the FIELD study that included analysis of 31,390 serial ECGs from 9795 patients aged 50 to 75 years over an average five-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3219079270\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from large observational cohort studies show that patients with asymptomatic Q wave MI diagnosed by ECG criteria have a similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/18,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,38</a>], or worse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/13,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,17</a>],<sup> </sup>long-term prognosis compared with those with clinically apparent MI in whom prompt treatment is initiated. The risk of incident cardiovascular events, including MI and cardiovascular death, for isolated minor Q waves in asymptomatic individuals was observed to be greater than in those without isolated Q waves in the MESA cohort (16.1 versus 10.4 per 1000-person year; p = 0.01) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, after adjusting for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, socioeconomic status, and other electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities, the presence of minor isolated Q waves was strongly associated in incident cardiovascular events in Hispanics (hazard ratio [HR] 2.62) but not in individuals of white or black ethnicity. </p><p>Asymptomatic patients with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-detected MI also have significantly increased risk for future cardiovascular disease (CVD) events compared with individuals without CMR-evidence of prior MI. In a study of 248 unselected 70-year-olds followed up for a mean 11 years, CMR-detected unrecognized MI was associated with &gt;twofold risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) compared with those with no MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In another study, diabetic patients with prior MI detected by CMR had an even higher fourfold increase in MACE over a period of 17 months compared with those without [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Clinically unrecognized MI detected by CMR (but not ECG criteria) was also associated with increased mortality in ICELAND-MI after adjustment for covariants (HR 1.45; 8 percent increased absolute risk) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Further evidence demonstrating the prognostic implications of CMR-detected undiagnosed MI is provided by two prospective longitudinal studies of patients with suspected stable coronary artery disease who lacked Q waves on their ECGs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. Moreover, the Strong Heart Study showed that echocardiographic segmental left ventricular wall motion abnormalities indicative of previous MI in adults without overt cardiovascular disease were associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of cardiovascular events or death, independent of established risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p>The relatively high number of CVD events may be attributable to multiple factors, including a lower rate of the use of proven preventive therapy, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and statins (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease or at high risk&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-for-the-secondary-prevention-of-atherosclerotic-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin for the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>). Moreover, the high prevalence of comorbid conditions observed in patients with silent MIs (including diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and systemic hypertension), as well as the fact that these patients are less likely to undergo percutaneous coronary artery stenting within the recommended 24- to 72-hour window following their event, are additional factors that potentially contribute the increased risk observed in this patient cohort. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4202103878\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFICULTIES WITH ECG DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Third Universal definition of MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] defines pathological Q waves by the following criteria: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any Q wave in leads V2-V3 &ge;0.02 seconds or QS complex in leads V2-V3</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Q wave &ge;0.03 seconds and &ge;0.1 mV deep or QS complex in leads I, II, aVL, aVF or V4-V6 in any two leads of a contiguous lead grouping</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>R wave &ge;0.04 seconds in V1-V2 and <span class=\"nowrap\">R/S</span> &ge;1 with a concordant positive T wave in absence of conduction defect</p><p/><p>Q waves are more likely to be diagnostic of a prior MI when an inverted T wave is also present in the same lead. The Q and QS wave patterns have moderate specificity (75 percent) and sensitivity (58 percent) for MI when compared with myocardial scintigraphy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>] &#160; While ECG criteria for MI in the Third Universal definition of MI are more sensitive and have greater negative predictive value than previously recommended criteria, this comes at the cost of lower specificity and positive predictive value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>There are a number of situations in which a Q wave is present on an ECG but does not represent true MI. A QS complex in lead V1 is normal. A narrow (&lt;0.03 seconds) and shallow (&lt;25 percent of R wave) Q wave in lead III is normal if the frontal QRS axis is between -30 and 0 degrees. Similarly, a Q wave in aVL may be normal if the frontal QRS axis is between 60 and 90 degrees. Septal Q waves in leads I, aVL, aVF, and V4-V6 are small, nonpathologic Q waves that are &lt;0.03 seconds and &lt;25 percent of the R wave amplitude in these leads. </p><p>Although the presence of right bundle branch block (RBBB) is not usually thought to interfere with the ECG diagnosis of Q wave MI in clinical practice, several reports have shown associations between RBBB and both false-negative and false-positive ECG diagnoses of Q wave MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Therefore, the finding of a new Q wave in an asymptomatic individual with a RBBB pattern on ECG warrants further corroboration to establish the diagnosis of transmural infarction. Similarly, left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) poses a diagnostic challenge when Q waves are present in leads V2 or V3, which occurs in 5 percent of patients with LAFB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p>Other situations that can mimic the ECG diagnosis of prior MI include respiratory Q waves in lead III arising from chest wall motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>] and electrolyte abnormalities. Incorrect lead placement, left ventricular hypertrophy, and presence of left bundle branch block may also lead to a false positive ECG.</p><p>Finally, the ECG may represent MI, but there are multiple causes of MI that are not caused by obstructive coronary artery disease. Examples include <span class=\"nowrap\">cardiomyopathy/myocarditis</span> with scar or coronary artery dissection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H301668514\"><span class=\"h1\">FURTHER DIAGNOSTIC TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The challenge for the general clinician is to determine which patients with abnormal or borderline ECG criteria for previously undiagnosed MI require further cardiac testing to confirm MI. Referral to a specialist may be useful in situations where the diagnosis remains in doubt. (See <a href=\"#H3630339777\" class=\"local\">'Referral to a specialist'</a> below.)</p><p>To confirm MI in an asymptomatic patient with Q waves on ECG, the ECG should first be repeated to ensure that lead malposition is not the cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F113841\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113841 \">algorithm 1</a>). The next step is to assess the cardiovascular risk profile of the patient and to inquire about the presence of cardiac symptoms in order to determine the clinical likelihood of an MI. From a practical point of view, in asymptomatic patients, clinical risk stratification tools designed to guide primary prevention treatment strategies, such as the &quot;ASCVD&quot; score that provides sex- and race-specific 10-year cardiovascular disease risk estimates based on pooled cohort data from studies performed in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>] or the &quot;QRISK2&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>] score based on general practice registry data from the United Kingdom, may be applied here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-risk-calculators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention: Risk calculators&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For most patients in whom a repeat ECG has confirmed the presence of worrisome abnormalities, we consider troponin testing when a recent event is suspected because of symptoms recalled by the patient or evolving changes on serial ECGs. </p><p>In most patients, we obtain additional diagnostic (and prognostic) information using stress or anatomical imaging (eg, coronary computed tomography angiography) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-coronary-imaging-with-cardiac-computed-tomography-and-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive coronary imaging with cardiac computed tomography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance&quot;, section on 'Coronary CT angiography and cardiac CT'</a>). For those patients at very low risk of a prior infarction based on the ECG, we may evaluate regional left ventricular function with echocardiography only. </p><p>The ischemic cascade paradigm indicates that myocardial ischemia predictably progresses through a series of steps to produce clinical disease by causing coronary flow maldistribution, hypoperfusion, diastolic dysfunction, systolic dysfunction, stress-induced ECG changes, angina, and, ultimately, myocardial necrosis resulting from acute MI. Thus, a range of noninvasive imaging techniques that detect cardiac perfusion, wall thickness, and function can be used, with or without stress testing, to confirm presence of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease or infarcted myocardium in patients with suspected MI based on the ECG. </p><p>In an otherwise asymptomatic patient, echocardiography, radionuclide ventriculography, myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) can be used to detect prior infarction. Computed tomography coronary angiography is another useful test with high sensitivity to exclude presence of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease in patients with low-to-intermediate cardiovascular risk, particularly when the ECG diagnosis is uncertain. </p><p>Beyond standard transthoracic echocardiography, choice of first-line noninvasive testing for suspected coronary disease will be guided by local expertise and availability and should be directed by specialist input.</p><p>The strength of echocardiography is the ability to assess cardiac structure and function without the need for potentially nephrotoxic contrast or exposure to ionizing radiation. Regional myocardial function can be assessed with conventional two-dimensional imaging, three-dimensional imaging, tissue Doppler, or myocardial strain imaging using speckle tracking. A normal, good quality echocardiogram without wall motion abnormality in a patient with asymptomatic Q waves on ECG decreases the likelihood that there is a true prior MI. Stress testing (with echocardiography, radionuclide imaging, or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) can also be used in such instances when the clinical suspicion remains high or the patient is otherwise at increased risk for having coronary artery disease. </p><p>Radionuclide imaging can detect myocardial viability and inducible perfusion abnormalities. Radionuclide imaging can also identify myocardial motion, thickening, and ejection fraction; however, this technique has poor spatial resolution compared with echocardiography or MRI. </p><p>CMR offers high spatial resolution and, in contrast to echocardiography and radionuclide imaging, has superior ability to image myocardial fibrosis and distribution of infarct throughout the myocardium and across myocardial layers (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical utility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging&quot;, section on 'CMR after myocardial infarction'</a>). The last point is especially relevant to patients presenting with asymptomatic Q waves on ECG because MRI can distinguish between subendocardial patterns of fibrosis versus other patterns of fibrosis that can mimic prior myocardial infarction. While CMR has advantages, echocardiography may be more accessible to many clinicians.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45189567\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT AFTER CONFIRMATION OF THE DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term management of patients with previously undiagnosed MI due to obstructive coronary artery disease should not differ from that of clinically recognized MI, as lack of overt clinical symptoms at the time of presentation has no relation to the severity of underlying atherosclerotic coronary artery disease or indeed long-term prognosis. However, none of the clinical trials of MI were specifically designed to test efficacy of drug intervention in asymptomatic patients in whom the diagnosis was incidental. </p><p>Young women with MI who present without symptoms are a particularly high-risk group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>], in whom prompt treatment is critical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/previously-undiagnosed-myocardial-infarction/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].
