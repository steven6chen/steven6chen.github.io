Most experience is confined to patients with ALPS-FAS, for whom lymphoproliferative disease begins early in life and tends to become less frequent in adolescence and adulthood. The development of autoimmune disease changes the therapy needed as well as the prognosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9567217\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation and monitoring following initial diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence and extent (disease manifestations and disease burden) of lymphoproliferation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> autoimmunity should be determined before initiating therapy in an individual newly diagnosed with ALPS or suspected to have ALPS.</p><p>This can be achieved with a combination of physical examination, imaging studies (eg, computed tomography [CT] scan <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> positron emission tomography [PET] scans) of body areas thought to be involved (typically neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis), and laboratory evaluation that includes measuring the size of the circulating alpha beta double-negative T (DNT) cell compartment, the levels of serum biomarkers (eg, vitamin B12, interleukin [IL]-10, Fas ligand [FasL]), blood counts, and the presence and nature of autoantibodies (eg, directed against blood cells). In patients deemed to need immunosuppressive therapy, one should also initiate a basic investigation of the integrity of immune system, particularly in young patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory evaluation of the immune system&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This evaluation should also include an assessment for lymphoma in patients with extensive lymphadenopathy, especially those with constitutional symptoms (eg fever, weight loss, night sweats). PET imaging may be helpful in this regard since it is often difficult to distinguish between benign (ALPS-specific) lymphadenopathy and malignant lymphoma that may be present concomitantly. PET scans can direct the surgeon to the node or nodes with high metabolic activity that are most likely to be of diagnostic value. Investigation for lymphoma is particularly important if immunosuppressive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunomodulating agents are contemplated since lymphoma development may be altered <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> masked by the use of these agents.</p><p>There is some evidence to suggest that periodic surveillance using combined anatomical (ie, CT scan) and <span class=\"nowrap\">functional/metabolic</span> (ie, PET scan) imaging may be helpful, although more long-term data collection is needed to determine the cost-to-benefit ratio of expensive imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-management-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Many laboratory findings, including the number of DNT cells and amounts of IL-10, FasL, and other biomarkers, not only serve a diagnostic purpose but also can be used to monitor disease activity and response to therapy.</p><p>Whether the patient needs to be treated and, if so, with which agent or agents, is determined following this evaluation. If the decision is made not to initiate treatment, periodic follow-up is recommended using the tools described above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9567224\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of disease manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of disease manifestations is focused on the <span class=\"nowrap\">control/treatment</span> of lymphoproliferation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> autoimmunity and the treatment of lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2,4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-9</a>]. Treatment of lymphoproliferation and autoimmune disease in ALPS is based upon observational data and clinical experience since there are no randomized trials. Therapy is individualized, and the choice of agent depends upon many patient-specific factors and practitioner preference and experience.</p><p>Once initiated, immunosuppressive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunomodulating therapy may be difficult to stop, which should be taken into consideration because of the side effects, risks, and cost of long-term immunosuppressive treatment. The development of symptomatic autoimmune cytopenias often indicates a new phase in the course of ALPS in a particular patient. Therapies that affect the immune system cannot be used for extended periods of time (years), particularly in children, without complications. For example, long-term use of glucocorticoids is associated with obesity, growth retardation, hypertension, cataracts, <span class=\"nowrap\">osteopenia/osteoporosis</span> leading to pathologic bone fractures, and diabetes, among others. Long-term use of antiproliferative T cell agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>) may cause significant infections and renal impairment. In addition, the immune system may not tolerate suppression for prolonged periods of time. Resolution of ALPS manifestations after years of therapy may be due to chronic immunosuppression rather than permanent remission of ALPS, indicating the need for periodic assessment of overall immune competence. This is particularly important in younger patients as they experience and acquire common viral infections, such as those due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-immunodeficiency-induced-by-biologic-therapies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary immunodeficiency induced by biologic therapies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3894358\"><span class=\"h3\">Lymphoproliferation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Manifestations of lymphoproliferation can be suppressed by the use of immunosuppressive agents, such as glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-management-and-prognosis/abstract/4,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10,11</a>]. The benefits of immunosuppression, however, are balanced by the side effects, and therapy is generally not required for lymphoproliferation in the absence of autoimmunity. In addition, lymphadenopathy as well as splenomegaly <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hepatomegaly return once immunosuppression is discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-management-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, we suggest use of immunosuppressive therapy only for severe complications of lymphoproliferation (eg, airway obstruction by enlarged tonsillar tissue or cervical adenopathy, massive splenomegaly) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in the presence of concomitant autoimmune manifestations that require therapy.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mycophenolate</a> mofetil is typically well tolerated and requires little monitoring, making it our preferred agent with which to start therapy. It appears to induce modest improvement in lymphadenopathy and some improvement in splenomegaly (in some patients) and laboratory markers, such as lymphocyte counts and IL-10 and vitamin B12 levels. Dose and duration of therapy should be individualized to the patient. It is reasonable to determine a minimal dose that accomplishes the goals of therapy.</p><p>Early experience with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> suggests that this agent may affect lymphoproliferation in a more sustained manner than other immunosuppressive agents, as demonstrated by more significant reduction in adenopathy, splenomegaly, and biomarkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-management-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This is balanced by the fact that sirolimus requires monitoring of levels, side effects, and complications, including infections. On the other hand, it is less mutagenic than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-management-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, long-term use of calcineurin inhibitors (eg, tacrolimus, cyclosporine) is associated with renal toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-management-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The author's approach is to determine if therapy is needed, based upon considerations discussed above. The author starts with the least immunosuppressive agent to accomplish treatment goals, particularly if long-term immunosuppression beyond a few weeks is needed. In most patients, this can be achieved with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, with or without a short course (approximately two to three weeks) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>. The author uses clinical response, including tolerability of the agent, physical examination (eg, degree of splenomegaly), and biomarkers to determine response and guide changes in drug dose (duration in therapy). In patients with insufficient response to mycophenolate, concomitant (or new) autoimmunity, or mycophenolate intolerance, the author reaffirms the necessity of long-term immunosuppressive therapy and, if indicated, initiates <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>, starting with a dose to keep drug levels at the lower end of the therapeutic range.</p><p>Splenectomy is <strong>not</strong> recommended in patients with ALPS, due to the reported lack of sustained therapeutic benefit and increased incidence of postsplenectomy sepsis in both children and adults. In the French ALPS cohort, 33 percent of 90 patients underwent splenectomy (40 percent for massive splenomegaly and 60 percent for refractory autoimmune cytopenias) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-management-and-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ALPS cohort, 44 percent of 150 patients needed splenectomy, three-quarters for refractory cytopenias that typically involved more than one lineage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-management-and-prognosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Of the patients who had splenectomy for severe cytopenias, 50 percent in the French cohort relapsed, and 30 and &gt;70 percent relapsed in the NIH cohort at 4 and 20 years postsplenectomy, respectively. Thrombocytopenia was the most common cytopenia seen in patients who relapsed.</p><p>An increased rate of sepsis in patients who had undergone splenectomy was also seen in both cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-management-and-prognosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In the French cohort, 9 of 30 patients suffered 17 cases of severe invasive bacterial infections with four deaths, while 27 of 66 in the NIH cohort suffered one or more episodes of sepsis with seven deaths. Young age was found to be a risk factor for sepsis postsplenectomy. Antimicrobial prophylaxis and appropriate vaccinations did not prevent the majority of the episodes of sepsis, although poor compliance was found to be a risk factor in the French cohort.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9567231\"><span class=\"h3\">Autoimmune manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autoimmune manifestations typically respond to immunosuppressive agents. Development of autoimmune manifestations, which invariably involve combinations of the autoimmune cytopenias (autoimmune hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia with or without neutropenia), signals a transition in the natural history of ALPS in many patients that is often characterized by the need to initiate or escalate therapy. Patients with autoimmune manifestations typically have a more difficult time coming off of immunosuppressive therapy than patients with lymphoproliferation only.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mycophenolate</a> mofetil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, and particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> are effective in chronic recalcitrant autoimmune cytopenias and may enable weaning or avoidance of glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-management-and-prognosis/abstract/9,11,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,16</a>].

Consequently, their offspring will not inherit the somatic mutation.

Some patients with particular mutations affecting the intracellular death domain of the Fas molecule may have a poorer prognosis, while those with defects in the extracellular domain may have more mild disease. However, it is impossible to predict which path each individual patient will follow, regardless of the genotype. Thus, long-term follow-up is indicated for the majority of patients to follow and try to anticipate the course of each individual's disease. A significant component of follow-up care should focus on education and empowerment of patients and their families.

(See <a href=\"#H9567210\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest use of immunosuppressive therapy only for severe complications of lymphoproliferation (eg, airway obstruction) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in the presence of concomitant autoimmune manifestations (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Splenectomy is <strong>not</strong> recommended for autoimmune manifestations in patients with ALPS, due to the reported lack of sustained therapeutic benefit and increased incidence of life-threatening postsplenectomy sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H9567224\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of disease manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HCT is reserved for selected patients, such as those with lymphoma or severe recalcitrant disease. (See <a href=\"#H9567252\" class=\"local\">'Curative therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients with ALPS have a favorable prognosis, with lymphadenopathy decreasing over time and autoimmune features remaining absent or manageable with limited need for immunosuppressive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H9567266\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2765938899\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge E Richard Stiehm, MD, who contributed as a Section Editor to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Rao VK, Oliveira JB.
