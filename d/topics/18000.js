Approximately 90 percent of anogenital warts are associated with HPV types 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> 11, which are of low oncogenic potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Additional HPV types (including high oncogenic risk types) may be identified, but usually as co-infections with HPV 6 or 11. </p><p>For most patients, the presence of genital warts is concerning because of their cosmetic appearance, association with a sexually transmitted disease, bothersome symptoms, absence of a cure, and social stigma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although treatment can eradicate the warts, disease recurrence is common and occurs in 20 to 30 percent of patients overall.</p><p>This topic will discuss treatment of vulvar and vaginal warts in women. The epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of anogenital warts, and issues related to men with anogenital infection, are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Condylomata acuminata (anogenital warts) in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-management-of-external-condylomata-acuminata-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Condylomata acuminata (anogenital warts): Management of external condylomata acuminata in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT COUNSELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be given an explanation of their disease and information about the indications for treatment, treatment options, and prognosis. Written material is available from several sources (see <a href=\"#H3316296\" class=\"local\">'Information for patients'</a> below). &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Information about human papillomavirus infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women want to know how and when they acquired the disease. We tell them that genital human papillomavirus (HPV) is spread by direct physical contact during sex. They may have acquired the infection years prior to diagnosis since the incubation period can last for months and their first recognition of a lesion may represent a relapse rather than a first episode. Therefore, a new diagnosis of genital warts does not mean that the patient or her partner is having sex outside the relationship. We also inform them that condoms provide some protection against HPV transmission, but contact with genital lesions not covered by the condom can result in infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Patients are also informed that HPV is so widespread that most men and women will have acquired an HPV infection during their lifetime, but are unaware of the infection because it is usually asymptomatic. Acquiring immunity to one type of HPV does not secure immunity against other types, so reinfection can occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus infections: Epidemiology and disease associations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15429408\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main indication for treatment of vulvovaginal warts is alleviation of bothersome symptoms (pruritus, bleeding, burning, tenderness, vaginal discharge, pain, obstruction of the vagina, dyspareunia) or psychologic distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. Warts do not pose serious risks to health or fertility; therefore, some symptomatic patients may reasonably choose expectant management to see if the warts spontaneously resolve. In placebo controlled treatment trials, spontaneous regression occurred in up to 40 percent of cases; the remainder remained stable or increased in size or number. </p><p>There is no medical indication for treatment of asymptomatic warts incidentally noted on physical examination, but patients should be made aware of the presence of these lesions. There is no reason to believe that treating vulvovaginal warts will reduce a woman&rsquo;s future risk of cancer. Similarly, treatment should not be undertaken to protect sexual contacts since there is no evidence that eradication of warts eliminates infectivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of treatment and prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be informed that prolonged treatment with frequent follow-up is often necessary. They should also understand that medical and surgical therapies lead to clearance of warts in 35 to 100 percent of patients in 3 to 16 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], but do not necessarily eradicate all HPV infected cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/6,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,10</a>]. Because clinically and histologically latent HPV can exist beyond the treatment area, the possibility of clinical recurrence or transmission of HPV to sexual partners remains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The likelihood of recurrence is variable depending on the patient's medical condition, immune status, and the extent of disease, but 20 to 30 percent of patients have a recurrence (new lesions at previously treated or new sites) within a few months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Nevertheless, most HPV infections associated with genital warts in immune competent patients are cleared within two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Both medical and surgical options are available for treatment. Treatment effectiveness studies show highly variable results, possibly reflecting variations in duration of follow-up, drug dosing, criteria for success, severity of disease, patient population, and HPV types. There is no high quality evidence that any treatment is significantly superior to another or appropriate for all patients and all types of warts; therefore, treatment choice is based on the location, number, and size of the warts; patient characteristics (eg, pregnancy, ability to comply with therapy, immunocompromise); availability of resources and clinical expertise; and patient preferences after considering side effects, cost, and convenience (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58922\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58922 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/13-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-27</a>]. Medical therapies are generally tried first; if the patient has not responded to the initial medical therapy after 3 weeks or complete clearance has not occurred by 6 to 12 weeks, a different medical therapy can be administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Surgical therapy is typically reserved for patients with extensive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bulky lesions and those who have failed to respond adequately to medical therapy. Surgery results in high initial clearance rates (90 to 100 percent), but recurrence rates are similar to those with medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15429822\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects and complications of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All therapies are associated with localized discomfort including itching, burning, erosions, and pain since the epithelium is disrupted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Complications resulting from treatment include hypo- or hyperpigmentation, scarring, and chronic vulvar pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Hypopigmentation is most common in areas where warts were surgically ablated, but has also been described after treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a>. Scarring is most common after surgical procedures that destroy subdermal tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15430200\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of sex partners</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sex partners can benefit from informational counseling.

Some of these methods can only be applied in the physician's office, while others can be self-administered by the patient at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. All medical therapies are most useful for patients with limited disease (eg, &le;5 small warts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]).

No more than 0.5 mL of podofilox should be applied in one day. She then withholds treatment for four days, and repeats this cycle weekly up to four times. Large areas (10 cm<sup>2</sup> or more) should not be treated in a single application because pain is likely when the area becomes necrotic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=podophyllum-resin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Podophyllum</a><strong> resin</strong> &mdash; Podophyllum resin is a plant-based resin that blocks cell division at metaphase and leads to cell death. The clinician applies a 25 percent solution directly to the warts with a cotton swab (or similar device). No more than 0.5 mL should be applied during each treatment session and large areas (10 cm<sup>2</sup> or more) should not be treated in a single application because of potential pain when the area becomes necrotic. The area should air-dry before the patient dresses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast to podophyllotoxin, systemic absorption and toxicity have been documented. A weaker solution (10 percent) should be used when treating large warts to minimize total systemic absorption, and application to open <span class=\"nowrap\">lesions/wounds</span> should be avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We instruct the patient to wash the area one to four hours after application of the drug, otherwise excessive skin irritation and systemic absorption can occur.

Application of an ointment or gel (such as petroleum or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> jelly) to the normal tissue surrounding the wart can help prevent spreading of acid to unaffected areas. Excessive application of 80 to 90 percent TCA can cause extensive chemical burns of the vagina, vulva and adjacent healthy tissue. If excess TCA is applied, it can be neutralized by washing with soap or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> solution. </p><p>The patient should not sit, stand or dress until the treatment area has dried.</p><p>Repeated weekly application is required for four to six weeks, or until the lesions have cleared.

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved any formulation of FU for treatment of anogenital warts and its use is contraindicated in pregnancy. A disadvantage of topical FU is that it is often poorly tolerated because of burning, pain, inflammation, edema, or painful ulcerations. For these reasons, topical FU has a limited role in the primary therapy of vulvar or vaginal warts.</p><p>A gel consisting of FU and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> in a purified bovine collagen matrix is under investigation. The gel is injected intradermally directly under the wart to create a wheal encompassing it and 5 mm of surrounding tissue. This provides a high concentration of drug for an extended period of time. Injections are performed once per week for up to six weeks. Clearance rates of 65 percent after a median of four treatments have been reported, but 40 percent of patients with a complete response had a recurrence at 90 days follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Side effects include local pain, erosion, ulceration, and urethro-vulvo-vaginitis.</p><p>Alternatively, a thin layer of 1 or 5 percent cream has been applied to vulvar or vaginal lesions to cause a chemical desquamation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/33-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-38</a>].

Two formulations are available, Aldara (5 percent imiquimod) and Zyclara (3.75 percent imiquimod), for treatment of external genital warts, but the manufacturers recommend against vaginal administration. There is insufficient information regarding the safety of imiquimod in pregnancy; animal studies suggest this therapy is low risk but use of imiquimod in pregnancy should be avoided until more data are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>The choice between the two formulations should be made based on patient preference, cost and convenience.

Zyclara is applied daily for up to 8 weeks. A mild, local inflammatory reaction (erythema, induration, <span class=\"nowrap\">ulceration/erosion,</span> itching, burning, vesicles) should occur, which is a sign the drug is working. It is generally not so severe as to preclude further treatment. If severe inflammation occurs, use of the drug should be stopped until the inflammation clears and then it can be restarted at a lower frequency.</p><p>Forty to 50 percent of women will have complete clearance of the warts and most of the remainder will have partial clearance, but up to 30 percent will experience a recurrence within 12 weeks.

Five percent of subjects discontinued the drug due to side effects and almost 90 percent reported local application site reactions, some of which were severe (pruritus, erythema, pain, inflammation, ulceration, edema, burning, induration, vesicular rash).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H378508907\"><span class=\"h4\">Interferons</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interferons have antiviral, antiproliferative, and immune-stimulating effects, theoretically making them an ideal agent for treatment of anogenital warts. Interferon-alpha and -beta have been administered as a systemic therapy (intramuscular injection), topically, and as a subcutaneous intralesional injection. Placebo controlled randomized trials have generally found intralesional therapy to be most effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>], while evidence for the efficacy of systemic and topical therapy has been inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/52-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-57</a>].</p><p>Intralesional injection of 0.5 to 1.5 milli-international units is administered two to three times per week for up to nine weeks. Local anesthesia is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients receiving interferons by any route commonly experience flu-like symptoms, fatigue, anorexia, and local pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/49,55,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,55,57</a>]. </p><p>Given the frequency of bothersome side effects, variable rates of effectiveness, and inconvenience of administration, we don&rsquo;t use interferon for primary treatment of anogenital warts. Interferon may be used as adjunctive therapy to surgical and cyto-destructive treatments, especially in patients with refractory lesions.</p><p>Interferons are contraindicated in pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h4\">Bacillus Calmette-Guerin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another approach beginning to appear in the literature involves topical administration of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>]. It has been used primarily for treatment of perianal warts in men and requires further study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h4\">HPV vaccine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HPV vaccines are effective in the primary prevention of HPV infection. Their use for treatment of anogenital warts or prevention of recurrent disease is investigational and is not recommended at this time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical management options consist of ablative and excisional procedures. Not infrequently, and especially in patients with extensive or multifocal disease, both ablative and excisional modalities are used. The choice of method should depend most on the availability of equipment and the surgeon&rsquo;s experience and personal preference. Regardless of the method chosen, the surgeon should maintain control of the depth of tissue destruction since deep destruction of vaginal lesions theoretically could lead to fistula formation. </p><p>An advantage of surgical management is that fewer visits for treatment are needed compared with medical therapy, although repeated procedures are sometimes necessary, especially with cryotherapy. A disadvantage of ablative therapies is that persistent hypo- or hyperpigmentation is not uncommon. A disadvantage of all surgical therapies (ablative or excisional) is that they generally require anesthesia and often need to be performed in an operating room; however, small lesions can be ablated or excised in the office with only sedation and local infiltration (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 1 percent with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>) in some highly motivated patients. Lastly, surgical therapy may result in scarring, especially when the subdermal layer is destroyed.</p><p>Biopsy is recommended to rule out underlying intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer prior to surgical treatment of lesions that are refractory to medical therapy. (See <a href=\"#H15428844\" class=\"local\">'Indications for pretreatment biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p>All of the surgical options can be used in pregnant women and on both the vulva and vagina.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Cryoablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cryoablation with either liquid nitrogen or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> destroys wart tissue via cell lysis. Although it is an office procedure, cryoablation causes pain during application and variable localized inflammation afterward. Providing local anesthesia for the procedure is especially important when the area undergoing cryotherapy is extensive.</p><p>Liquid nitrogen is most commonly used, and is applied directly to the vulvar or vaginal lesion with a cotton swab or a fine spray. The treatment is applied for 30 to 60 seconds, until an ice ball forms and encompasses the lesion and 1 to 2 mm surrounding area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Repeated weekly application is required until the lesions have resolved. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitrous oxide</a> is dispensed via a cryoprobe and generally gives a greater depth of freezing; therefore, it is not recommended for use in the vagina because of the risk of vaginal perforation and fistula formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Side <span class=\"nowrap\">effects/adverse</span> reactions include skin irritation, edema, blistering, and ulceration. Post-treatment hypopigmentation is also relatively common. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Laser ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lasers produce light energy, which is absorbed by water within warty tissues, leading to thermal damage and resultant ablation. Carbon dioxide laser is the most commonly utilized type of laser for treatment of vulvar warts, but requires specific training and specialized equipment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Laser ablation is the preferred therapy for extensive or multifocal lesions. In such cases, surgical excision is undesirable since large areas of vulvar skin would have to be removed. Laser is also useful for treating cervical and vaginal warts when surgical excision is technically challenging or not feasible.</p><p>A major benefit of using laser rather than the surgical knife on the vulva is that the laser better maintains normal vulvar anatomy. However, up to 28 percent of patients develop some scar formation post-laser surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Other risks of laser surgery include pain and hypopigmentation. Rarely, patients may develop chronic pain and vulvodynia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]; patients should be counseled about these risks prior to treatment.</p><p>Anogenital warts are epithelial in location; therefore, vaporization should only be carried down to the level of the superficial (papillary) dermis, and no deeper. Scar formation can occur when the laser beam penetrates too deeply. In order to best identify tissue planes and achieve the appropriate depth of treatment, we suggest colposcopic guidance be utilized during the laser procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. For patients with multifocal or refractory disease, a combination of techniques is often effective. As an example, excision is used to &quot;debulk&quot; the warty tissue, followed by laser ablation of the base (see <a href=\"#H378510146\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent disease'</a> below).</p><p>The surgeon and operating room personnel should wear protective masks when performing laser ablation, as HPV DNA can be dispersed in the laser plume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>Following laser treatment, pain management and careful attention to vulvar hygiene are crucial. Patients are instructed to take sitz baths two to three times a day during the initial one to two weeks following the procedure. Antibacterial creams or ointments are suggested to prevent superficial infection, as well as to separate the vulvar folds and prevent agglutination of tissues. For prevention of agglutination, the patient is instructed to gently separate the vulvar folds each day during healing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H378509078\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrocautery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrocautery can also be used for ablation of vulvar or vaginal lesions. An advantage of this approach over cryoablation is that a single treatment session is usually adequate for eliminating the warts. A disadvantage is that electrocautery requires administration of anesthesia and use of an operating room. If available, laser ablation is generally preferable to electrocautery because it is associated with less bleeding and discomfort following the procedure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasonic aspiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CUSA technique (Cavitron ultrasonic aspirator-CUSA) utilizes ultrasound to fragment and aspirate warty tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. This allows removal of epithelium without damage to underlying tissue. As with other ablative techniques, exclusion of intraepithelial neoplasia and malignancy is critical prior to treatment by CUSA, since the pathologic specimen obtained is shallow and fragmented and thus may be insufficient to exclude invasion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H378509105\"><span class=\"h3\">Excision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If tissue is needed for histological diagnosis, an excisional biopsy can be performed before an ablative procedure, or an excisional procedure can be performed.</p><p>Typically, exophytic lesions are tangentially excised or shaved to the level of normal skin using scissors or a surgical knife, and then the base of the lesion is cauterized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. For larger lesions, wide local excision is often required.

Another comparative trial that included both men and women with genital warts also reported podophyllotoxin was more effective than podophyllum resin for clearance of all warts (84 versus 62 percent of patients had clearance of lesions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

Pregnancy is associated with a decrease in cell mediated immunity, which may lead to a worsening of viral infection. Few studies have evaluated human papillomavirus (HPV) in pregnancy and most showed an increase in prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/77-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-79</a>].</p><p>Indications for treatment of anogenital warts in pregnant women are similar to those for nonpregnant women. In addition, lesions that potentially obstruct the birth canal (vagina and perineum) should be treated to avoid complications during vaginal birth. Treatment may not reduce the risk of vertical transmission (see <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Vertical transmission and mode of delivery'</a> below).</p><p>Treatment options are limited in pregnancy because podophyllin, podophyllotoxin, interferon, and FU are all contraindicated because of potential fetal harm. In one case series, four pregnant women with anogenital warts were treated with topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a> 5% cream three times per week for four weeks with no adverse fetal or neonatal effects and significant clearance of lesions (70 percent in two women and 84 percent in the other two women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. However, given the scarcity of data on use of imiquimod or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinecatechins-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sinecatechins</a> in pregnancy, these drugs are generally not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>TCA has no systemic absorption and no known fetal effects; therefore, it is the preferred medical treatment for pregnant women.

We prefer to begin with TCA treatment because it has fewer side effects than cryoablation.

Juvenile-onset respiratory papillomatosis (JRP) is the most severe outcome, although rare. Children are usually diagnosed with this condition at 2 to 5 years of age, and may require multiple surgical procedures during their lifetime. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children#H36\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Common causes of hoarseness in children&quot;, section on 'Papillomatosis (HPV)'</a>.)</p><p>Epidemiologic studies have linked JRP to a history of maternal anogenital warts. Early case series reviewed medical histories for mothers of JRP-affected children, and found a history of anogenital warts in about 50 percent of these women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/88-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">88-91</a>] and a 1 in 400 risk of JRP in infants of mothers with genital warts at delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. These studies are limited by availability of complete medical information, possible recall bias, and lack of control groups. A subsequent retrospective cohort study overcame some of these limitations with the use of detailed national Danish registries and appropriate selection of a control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. This study reported the rate of JRP was significantly higher in women with a diagnosis of anogenital warts in pregnancy than in nondiagnosed controls, with an estimated rate of transmission of 7 per 1000 affected women. Furthermore, JRP lesions were most likely to carry HPV types 6 and 11, which are the types commonly found in anogenital warts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. This association raises important questions as to whether antenatal therapy or elective cesarean delivery can reduce the incidence of this disease in children.</p><p>No studies have examined the effect of antenatal treatment of warts on viral transmission to the fetus. Given that treatment of visible lesions is unlikely to eradicate the HPV virus, particularly virus in the upper vagina and endocervical canal, the potential for transmission likely remains even after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Use of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine has been proposed as a means to boost maternal and fetal immunity and decrease vertical transmission rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. However, there are no data to support this theoretical benefit. Given that the vaccine has not been approved or studied in pregnant women, we do not advise this practice.</p><p>Early information suggested that neonatal inoculation occurred during passage through the birth canal. DNA analysis of newborn nasopharyngeal aspirates showed a 36 percent detection rate in vaginally delivered infants, with no detection in those delivered by cesarean delivery. However, this study was limited by very low numbers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. A separate study looked at cesarean delivery rates for births that were later affected by JRP, and found that the actual cesarean delivery rate was much lower than the expected rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. While these studies suggest that cesarean delivery may protect against neonatal infection, other data limit this conclusion. Neonatal infection has been described following cesarean delivery with unruptured membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>], and the detection of HPV DNA in placental tissue and cord blood, regardless of mode of delivery, suggests that vertical transmission may occur antepartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Furthermore, one large retrospective cohort study found no protective benefit of cesarean delivery on the rate of neonatal JRP infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p>In view of these data, as well as the potential morbidity of cesarean delivery, and the fact that elective cesarean delivery has not been proven to prevent transmission of HPV, we suggest not performing cesarean delivery for women with anogenital warts for the sole indication of preventing JRP or vertical transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/6,81,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,81,94</a>]. Cesarean delivery is indicated if vulvar or vaginal warts obstruct the birth canal, as the lesions may avulse and hemorrhage or cause dystocia during an attempted vaginal delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">HIV infected and immunocompromised women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are immunocompromised are particularly prone to development of condyloma, and often develop bulky <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extensive lesions requiring repetitive treatment. The prevalence of anogenital warts is higher in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients, who often have more than one HPV type, as well as higher viral loads of HPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/100-104\" class=\"abstract_t\">100-104</a>]. In one study, the cumulative incidence of genital warts was 33 percent in HIV-seropositive versus 9 percent in HIV-seronegative women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. In another study, HIV-1 seropositive Kenyan female sex workers were nearly eight times as likely to have genital wars compared with HIV-1 seronegative women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p>Vulvar biopsy is indicated when warts are identified in immunocompromised women because high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia is more common in warty lesions in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,107</a>]. In fact, high-oncogenic risk HPV types are detected in up to 50 percent of genital warts removed from immunocompromised individuals, but only occasionally in immunocompetent individuals. Patients with HIV who are known to carry HPV are also at increased risk of vulvar carcinoma in addition to cervical cancer, and should therefore have a thorough vulvar examination as part of routine gynecologic care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. However, the absolute risk of invasive vulvar cancer is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p>Following biopsy to rule-out intraepithelial neoplasia, we suggest that immunocompromised women initially self-treat their warts with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a>. Topical 5 percent imiquimod is effective in immunocompromised women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>], and may be more effective than traditional medical therapies and surgical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. In observational studies, approximately one-third of patients (primarily male) on antiretroviral therapy treated with imiquimod achieved total clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/110,111\" class=\"abstract_t\">110,111</a>]. Women who cannot adhere to this outpatient therapy and those whose warts do not clear with medical treatment can be treated surgically. We prefer surgical excision to laser therapy, as the former allows pathologic analysis of removed tissue. </p><p>Complete and permanent remissions of HPV anogenital lesions have been achieved with topical, intralesional, or systemic administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cidofovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cidofovir</a> in a number of case reports; however, no large controlled trials have been performed. Furthermore, it was teratogenic and embryotoxic in animal studies; there are no data from human pregnancies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cidofovir-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cidofovir: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although most women with HIV will have regression of warts with treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>], recurrence is common after all therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/110,112\" class=\"abstract_t\">110,112</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Involvement of the clitoris</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We treat warts on the clitoris with the same therapies used on vulva warts.

Follow-up appointments are based on patient symptoms and satisfaction with treatment results. Most patients who develop recurrent or refractory disease are diagnosed within three to six months of therapy. Recurrence is more common in immunocompromised individuals; more frequent follow-up or self-monitoring is reasonable to allow early intervention in these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15430122\"><span class=\"h2\">Cancer screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with anogenital warts should undergo cervical cancer screening according to standard guidelines. As discussed above, HPV types associated with anogenital warts usually are not the same as those associated with cervical carcinoma, but oncogenic HPV viruses are sometimes involved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-cervical-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for cervical cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If they have no history of vulvar dysplasia, they should be followed with vulvar exams at the time of scheduled cervical cancer screening, and counseled that new oral, vulvar, or vaginal warts should be evaluated by a medical professional.</p><p>Women with perianal warts or a history of receptive anal intercourse may be at increased risk of high-grade anal squamous intraepithelial neoplasia, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend screening anal cytology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].
