Advantages to DBS rather than surgical treatments, such as thalamotomy and pallidotomy, are that DBS is nondestructive, reversible, and adjustable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-patients-who-undergo-deep-brain-stimulator-implantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss anesthetic management and potential perioperative complications in patients undergoing DBS implantation. The anesthetic implications of a pre-existing implanted DBS system are also discussed, since these patients may undergo subsequent surgical procedures.

The DBS hardware has three main components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multicontact intracranial quadripolar electrodes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A programmable single- or dual-channel internal pulse generator (IPG) with battery unit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An extension cable connecting the DBS electrodes to the IPG</p><p/><p>The overall surgical procedure involves two stages. In the first stage, electrode(s) are placed in the target area of the brain usually using an &quot;awake (conscious) brain surgery&quot; technique. In the second stage, the electrodes and the extension cable are tunneled subcutaneously from the cranial area to the infraclavicular area where they are connected to the programmable IPG. This stage is either performed immediately following the procedure or as a separate procedure at a later date.</p><p>Most centers do not initiate stimulation until two to four weeks following lead implantation; edema around freshly implanted electrodes (the so-called &quot;microlesion effect&quot;) may interfere with immediate postoperative assessment of clinical symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-patients-who-undergo-deep-brain-stimulator-implantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55749413\"><span class=\"h2\">Placement of stimulating electrodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The therapeutic effectiveness of DBS depends on the placement of the stimulating electrodes in close proximity to the target nuclei. The therapeutic target sites selected for stimulation (eg, the subthalamic nuclei, globus pallidus interna nuclei, or the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus) depend upon the patient's disease and symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-patients-who-undergo-deep-brain-stimulator-implantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Since the target nuclei are often deep-seated and small, a combination of methods is most commonly used to accurately place the electrodes, starting with stereotactic frame-based imaging. Additional methods of localization (microelectrode recording [MER], macrostimulation) may be used during the procedure, since the brain can shift during intracranial placement of electrodes due to changes in patient positioning <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> loss of cerebrospinal fluid through the burr hole wound. Frameless imaging using intraoperative or diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), without the need for MER or macrostimulation, is emerging as an alternative to frame-based imaging for DBS placement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2697799910\"><span class=\"h3\">Frame-based imaging to identify the target nuclei</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A stereotactic head frame is usually applied using local anesthesia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94666\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94666 \">picture 1</a>). Uncooperative patients or those with severe dystonia may require general anesthesia (GA) for this portion of the procedure. With the stereotactic frame in place, MRI is performed to identify target nuclei, allowing the surgeon to establish external coordinates for electrode insertion. Computed tomography (CT) scanning can be used if MRI is contraindicated or not possible in an individual patient.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Target localization with the use of MER </strong>&ndash; Many centers utilize an electrophysiologic technique known as MER to further fine-tune localization of the target sites. The neurophysiology team obtains MERs to detect and amplify the activity of individual neurons.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This process may be time-consuming. A microelectrode is inserted to a point 10 to 15 mm above the target, then slowly advanced in 0.5 to 1.0 mm increments while its tip records and amplifies neuronal discharges along its path. Specific brain structures can be identified based on their unique firing patterns. Using these variations in spontaneous firing rates between specific nuclei, as well as changes in the firing rates related to specific patient active and passive movements, the neurophysiology team is able to localize the specific brain target. This allows feedback along the entire trajectory and fine adjustments of position before inserting the final electrode.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Macrostimulation testing</strong> &ndash; Ideally, the patient is awake during surgery, allowing the team to briefly activate the implanted deep brain electrode in order to confirm clinical improvement (efficacy) and detect any adverse side effects during neurostimulation. The electrode is secured when the team is satisfied with its location, then the burr hole wound is closed. A second electrode may be inserted in the contralateral brain hemisphere if bilateral DBS is planned.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1687950841\"><span class=\"h3\">Interventional MRI-guided technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interventional or intraoperative MRI (iMRI) scanners may be used for some indications (eg, Parkinson disease) to allow DBS insertion without the use of a stereotactic head frame, MER, or macrostimulation, and is usually performed under GA. Accuracy of frameless stereotaxis has improved significantly with advances in imaging technology, and reported outcomes are similar to or better than those with frame-based techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-patients-who-undergo-deep-brain-stimulator-implantation/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. </p><p>iMRI-guided lead implantation allows DBS placement for patients who cannot tolerate or refuse an awake procedure, and does not require discontinuation of preoperative medication for intraoperative testing. Other advantages of iMRI guidance include real time imaging, shorter duration of the procedure, reduced number of electrode penetrations, and early detection of complications (eg, intracerebral hemorrhage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-patients-who-undergo-deep-brain-stimulator-implantation/abstract/10,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13,14</a>]. The electrode trajectory is planned from magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained after the burr hole is created, and after brain shift with loss of cerebrospinal fluid.</p><p>The safety considerations associated with procedures performed in the MRI environment are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-magnetic-resonance-imaging-and-computed-tomography-procedures#H468025118\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography procedures&quot;, section on 'Anesthetic challenges for magnetic resonance imaging'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195992308\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION AND PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These patients should generally have preanesthesia evaluation prior to the day of surgery for electrode insertion. For standard stereotactic frame-based procedures, patients should be assessed for their willingness and ability to tolerate a potentially lengthy procedure awake, and should fully understand what will happen on the day of the procedure. Many patients undergoing DBS implantation are older and have associated comorbidities. In addition to a complete anesthesia-directed history and physical examination, we focus preanesthesia evaluation for these procedures on the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Airway assessment &ndash; </strong>The patient should be assessed for potential difficulty with airway management and the possibility of airway obstruction with sedation. The stereotactic frame is normally placed on the scalp with local anesthesia, with or without sedation, and is ultimately clamped to the operating table. Laryngoscopy with the patient's head immobilized in a stereotactic frame may be difficult or impossible, especially if the need arises emergently. Thus, regardless of the original anesthetic plan, a plan for urgent airway management should be formulated, and the equipment necessary to remove the frame should be immediately available throughout the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H1041401183\" class=\"local\">'Perioperative complications of DBS implantation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia#H717871122\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway management for induction of general anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Airway assessment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preoperative medication management </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>The plan for perioperative medication management should be coordinated with the neurosurgical team. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Discontinuation of antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications prior to DBS electrode insertion to minimize the risk of intracranial hemorrhage may require coordination with the patient's primary care clinician or cardiologist. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Depending on institutional preferences, drugs prescribed for the patient's neurologic or psychiatric disease may be withheld on the morning of the surgery to facilitate testing. However, this practice may lead to flares of symptoms (eg, bulbar and motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson disease) that complicate anesthetic management. If symptoms are severe, a reduced dose of the patient's regular medication may be administered after consultation with the neurosurgical team.

In a retrospective review of 136 patients who underwent awake DBS electrode placement in one center, withholding ACE inhibitors or ARBs was an independent risk factor for the need for aggressive intraoperative antihypertensive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-patients-who-undergo-deep-brain-stimulator-implantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

In addition, these patients are often taking multiple prescription medications, which may increase the risk of perioperative drug interactions.

Patients are usually placed in the semi-sitting or semi-Fowler's position, with the head elevated approximately 30 degrees (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F116501\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116501 \">picture 2</a>). Draping should allow access to the patient's face, arms, and legs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F116500\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116500 \">picture 3</a>), while maintaining a sterile surgical site. Attention to thermal control also enhances patient comfort.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3433306977\"><span class=\"h2\">Foley catheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insertion of a urinary catheter may be avoided because the patient is awake. However, vigilant monitoring of fluid administration is necessary in order to minimize bladder distention due to excessive fluid administration while avoiding hypovolemia due to inadequate fluid administration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H944039378\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodynamic management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypertension is a common perioperative problem during awake DBS electrode insertion; blood pressure should be controlled to minimize the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage during electrode insertion. Parameters for optimal intraoperative blood pressure are not well defined; we suggest maintaining the systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg, or within 20 percent of the patient's usual systolic blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-patients-who-undergo-deep-brain-stimulator-implantation/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>].</p><p>Hypotension is more common during general anesthesia (GA), and may occur due to autonomic dysfunction in patients with Parkinson disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the vasodilating effects of anti-Parkinson medications and anesthetics. For most patients, we aim for a mean blood pressure within 20 percent of the patient's baseline, and administer fluids and vasoactive medications as necessary.

Therefore, noninvasive blood pressure measurements should be corrected for the hydrostatic difference between the measurement site and the brain, and transducers used for invasive blood pressure monitoring should be leveled at the external auditory meatus. These issues are discussed separately.

We prefer the use of monitored anesthesia care (MAC) with local anesthesia and sedation rather than GA whenever possible for stereotactic frame-based stimulating electrode placement, to allow optimal microelectrode recording (MER) localization and macrostimulation testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-patients-who-undergo-deep-brain-stimulator-implantation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The decision for MAC with sedation (versus GA) is best made before surgery after careful preoperative assessment, including airway assessment.

GA can be used for most patients who undergo electrode insertion guided by real time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning (intraoperative MRI [iMRI]-guided technique). GA is commonly used for pediatric patients undergoing DBS implantation, although conscious sedation has been used successfully in some children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-patients-who-undergo-deep-brain-stimulator-implantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">GA may interfere with MER, depending on the target nucleus, and prevents macrostimulation testing for efficacy and assessment of side effects. In some patients with Parkinson disease requiring only subthalamic nuclei stimulation, placement of stimulating electrodes may be performed with GA with or without MER [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-patients-who-undergo-deep-brain-stimulator-implantation/abstract/13,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,25</a>].

Conscious sedation is often employed during incisions and bony opening, reduced or discontinued for electrode insertion and electrophysiologic testing, and restarted for closure after macrostimulation testing. Residual sedative effects during the macrostimulation testing phase may be minimized if short-acting agents are used and they are stopped well before this phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-patients-who-undergo-deep-brain-stimulator-implantation/abstract/19-21,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21,28</a>].</p><p>We suggest use of a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexmedetomidine</a> infusion with opioids and avoidance of benzodiazepines and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>.
