The majority of injuries occur in young adults: 57 percent of cases occur in people 16 to 30 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Most injuries (&gt;80 percent) occur in males. Motor vehicle crash is the most common mechanism of injury and accounts for approximately 35 percent of cases. The next most common mechanisms (in descending order) are gunshot wounds, falls, and recreational sporting activities, particularly diving and in the United States, American football [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective study of 1016 cases of traumatic spinal cord injury in Germany, 14 percent were caused in sport or diving accidents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The sporting activities during which the injuries were sustained included downhill skiing, horseback riding, air sports (eg, hang-gliding, paragliding), gymnastics, and trampolining. Spinal cord injuries can also occur in ice hockey, where the typical mechanism involves being body-checked from behind and falling head-first into the boards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Spinal cord injuries may be complete or partial. Partial spinal cord injuries include the central cord syndrome, anterior cord syndrome, Brown-S&eacute;quard syndrome, cervical cord neurapraxia, and spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA). </p><p>SCIWORA is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The management of athletes with cervical spinal cord injuries should be directed by a neurosurgeon. The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> in patients with spinal cord injury is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute traumatic spinal cord injury&quot;, section on 'Glucocorticoids'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Complete cord syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trauma is the most common cause of complete transection of the spinal cord. Other causes include infarction, hemorrhage, and acute disc herniation.</p><p>Transection of the spinal cord results in complete loss of motor, sensory and autonomic function below the level of the lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63597\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63597 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53006\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53006 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72447\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72447 \">figure 2</a>). Acute spinal cord transections can cause spinal shock via the removal of ascending and descending cerebral impulses. Spinal shock is manifested by flaccid paralysis with absent deep tendon reflexes in the first day or two after injury. This period of flaccid paralysis is followed by spasticity with hyperactive reflexes. Transection at or above the C3-C5 level can result in diaphragmatic paralysis and respiratory failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory complications in the adult patient with chronic spinal cord injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sympathetic interruption in complete spinal cord interruption can cause neurogenic shock. The sudden loss of sympathetic tone leads to decreased systemic vascular resistance and increased vagal tone, which result in hypotension with paradoxical bradycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Other symptoms of neurogenic shock include gastrointestinal dysmotility, bowel and bladder dysfunction, and problems with temperature regulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-classification-of-shock-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and classification of shock in children&quot;, section on 'Distributive shock'</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of the athlete with an acute cervical spine injury involves cervical spine immobilization and transport to an emergency medical facility for specialty care. The prognosis for functional improvement in patients with complete cervical spinal cord transection is poor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric cervical spinal motion restriction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Field care and evaluation of the child or adolescent athlete with acute neck injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Central cord syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The central cord syndrome is the most common of the partial cord syndromes. It is typically seen in older patients with degenerative spine disease and cervical spondylosis. In athletes, the central cord syndrome is usually caused by hyperextension injury during which the ligamentum flavum is thought to buckle, resulting in increased pressure on the central cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. It may also occur after traumatic disc herniation, trivial trauma, or in hyperflexion injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/11,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13-15</a>].</p><p>The characteristic physical findings of central cord syndrome are bilateral motor paresis greater in the upper than in the lower extremities, bladder dysfunction, and variable sensory loss below the level of injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72447\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72447 \">figure 2</a>). This pattern occurs because the most central portions of the spinal tracts contain fibers from the upper extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71763\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71763 \">figure 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-localization-of-spinal-cord-disorders#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders&quot;, section on 'Central cord syndromes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Anterior cord syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anterior cord syndrome is caused by direct or indirect injury to the anterior spinal cord. Direct injury may occur secondary to a crush injury or compression from a hematoma; indirect injury result from ischemia secondary to compression of the anterior spinal artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In athletes, anterior cord syndrome is typically seen after hyperflexion injuries with bony instability, acute disc herniation, or hematoma formation.</p><p>The anterior cord syndrome, which involves injury to the spinothalamic tract, is characterized by loss of motor, pain, light touch, and temperature sensation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72447\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72447 \">figure 2</a>). Because the posterior columns are preserved, the patient retains fine touch, vibration, pressure, and proprioception sensation distal to the injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71763\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71763 \">figure 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-neck-pain-or-injury#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the child or adolescent athlete with neck pain or injury&quot;, section on 'Anatomy'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the usual care for spinal cord injury, treatment of the anterior cord syndrome involves stabilization or removal of any structure that exerts increased pressure on the anterior aspect of spinal cord. Laminectomy may be necessary to decompress the spinal cord.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Brown-S&eacute;quard syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Brown-S&eacute;quard syndrome is a rare spinal injury that results in hemisection of the spinal cord. It is usually caused by penetrating trauma; other causes include blunt trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], disc or bone herniation, hematoma, and tumor. The Brown-S&eacute;quard syndrome can also occur as a complication of decompression sickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>The Brown-S&eacute;quard syndrome is characterized by ipsilateral loss of motor function, vibration, and proprioception below the level of the lesion with contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation beginning approximately two levels below the lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72447\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72447 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71763\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71763 \">figure 3</a>). This pattern of deficits occurs because the spinothalamic tract travels on the ipsilateral side of the cord before crossing over to the contralateral side. In addition, ipsilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation may occur at one or two levels below the lesion. Most cases of Brown-S&eacute;quard syndrome are partial cases with varying degrees of paresis and analgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The Brown-S&eacute;quard syndrome also may be associated with Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, and anhydrosis) if there is coexistent injury to the cervical paravertebral sympathetic chain and inferior cervical (stellate) ganglion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=horner-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Horner syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical cord neurapraxia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical cord neurapraxia (CCN), also known as transient quadriparesis or transient neurapraxia, is a rare cervical spine injury that is often considered a &quot;concussion&quot; of the cervical spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. It is thought to be caused by axial loading of the neck in flexion or extension. CCN occurs most commonly in football players who lead with their heads when hitting an opposing player. In the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the incidence is 1.3 per 10,000 athletes per season [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The affected athlete has sudden posttraumatic onset of <strong>bilateral</strong> sensory, motor, or combined neurologic deficit. Sensory findings include burning, numbness, tingling, or loss of sensation; motor findings include weakness or complete paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Burning hands syndrome, a variant of this central cord injury, consists only of upper-extremity symptoms, most notably temporary burning dysesthesias and weakness of the arms and hands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. By definition, the symptoms of CCN are transient and completely resolve within 10 minutes to 48 hours. CCN should be distinguished from cervical &quot;burners&quot; (unilateral paresis of an upper extremity, often associated with neck pain) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Cervical burners'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanism of injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology and mechanism of injury in CCN are incompletely understood. CCN is thought to result from compression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> contusion of the spinal cord. One hypothesis is that the cervical cord is compressed between the posterior margin of one vertebral body and the anterior margin of the spinous process of the vertebra below it (the pincer mechanism, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67314\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67314 \">figure 4</a>)) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Such compression is most likely to occur in a hyperextension injury with axial loading. Compression of the spinal cord is postulated to cause prolongation of the absolute refractory period of the long tract axons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Reversible magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electrophysiologic abnormalities have been documented in patients with burning hands syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Cervical spinal stenosis is a risk factor that can predispose athletes to CCN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], although it is inconsistently present in children with CCN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Functional spinal stenosis is defined as the loss of cerebrospinal fluid from around the spinal cord or deformation of the spinal cord (as seen on contrast-enhanced CT, MRI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52011\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52011 \">image 1</a>), or myelography) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. The stenosis is most common at the C3-C5 levels and is usually congenital, although it can be acquired (eg, in disk herniation, cervical spine instability, etc).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of athletes with CCN have spinal stenosis or some other cervical spine abnormality. Burning hands syndrome is associated with a bony or ligamentous spinal abnormality in approximately one-half of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Thus, the initial evaluation consists of cervical spine radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] to evaluate for evidence of spinal canal stenosis, cervical instability, or congenital anomalies, such as Klippel-Feil syndrome (a disorder in which there is congenital fusion of variable numbers of cervical vertebrae and associated defects including scoliosis, renal anomalies, elevated scapula, congenital heart disease, and deafness).</p><p>Plain radiographs are usually followed by MRI to better identify and clarify the extent of any associated pathology (eg, congenital spinal stenosis, herniated disk, intrinsic cord abnormalities, or ligamentous injury) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/21,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,36</a>]. If the MRI is inconclusive, contrast-positive computed tomography (CT) or myelogram can be used to better delineate the anatomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Return to play</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether spinal stenosis increases the risk of permanent neurologic injury in the young athlete is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/32,37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,37-40</a>]. Some studies indicate that spinal stenosis predisposes to spinal cord injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>], but clear evidence of permanent injury is lacking. Thus, it is difficult to establish guidelines for returning to play.</p><p>We do not permit our patients with proven spinal stenosis to participate in contact or collision sports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The decision regarding return to play for athletes who have CCN and no evidence of cervical spine stenosis or abnormality after a thorough evaluation must be individualized for each athlete in consultation with an experienced neurosurgeon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CERVICAL PERIPHERAL NERVE INJURIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peripheral nerve injuries are classified into three categories according to severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/41-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-45</a>]. Within each grade, and across the categories, there is a spectrum of clinical severity.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade I injury, or neurapraxia, describes a disturbance of physiologic function without significant damage to or degeneration of the nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Transient alteration of motor or sensory function usually lasts seconds to minutes, but more severe cases can last up to a few weeks. By definition, electrophysiologic evidence of denervation is absent when tested 18 to 21 days after the injury. The prognosis for full recovery for all grade I injuries is excellent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade II injury, or axonotmesis, describes an injury resulting in some axonal and myelin degeneration within an intact neurilemmal sheath. Motor or sensory losses persist for at least two weeks. At 18 to 21 days, the electromyogram (EMG) is abnormal, and it may remain so up to one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Full recovery is often seen, but it may be incomplete and unpredictable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade III injury, or neurotmesis, is the most severe injury and is rarely seen in athletic competition. Grade III injuries are characterized by complete disruption of the nerve with complete degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. EMG changes are permanent. Some motor units may attempt to regenerate, resulting in as much as 30 percent recovery of motor function. However, prognosis for good functional outcome is generally poor.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical burners</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The &quot;burner,&quot; or &quot;stinger,&quot; is a brachial plexus injury resulting from trauma to the neck and shoulder. It is one of the most common injuries among football players, occurring at least once in 50 to 65 percent of football players during a four-year college career.
