In most of these trials, patients presumed to be at especially high risk for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) were excluded from participation, in large part because the antithrombotic benefits were yet to be fully defined while the bleeding risks appeared unduly high.</p><p>Because of under-representation in clinical trials, determining the relative efficacy and safety of antithrombotic agents in patients at varying increased risks for ICH is problematic. Nevertheless, clinicians are regularly faced with <span class=\"nowrap\">risk/benefit</span> decisions regarding antithrombotic therapy for such patients.

Most ruptures result in subclinical foci of self-limited bleeding, termed &quot;microbleeds&quot;, which can be found at autopsy or detected using special gradient sequence MRI techniques. Advancing age, especially age &gt;75 years, and hypertension are the strongest predictors of this phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-intracerebral-bleeding-in-patients-treated-with-anticoagulants/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. These microbleeds are believed to be the result of an underlying angiopathy that predisposes patients to intracerebral bleeding. Occasionally, leakage of blood from an arteriolar rupture is not stopped by normal hemostatic mechanisms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> compression by surrounding tissue and a larger ICH ensues. This phenomenon underlies the pathogenesis of spontaneous ICH, an especially devastating type of stroke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Cerebral microbleeds'</a>.)</p><p>Anticoagulants increase the likelihood that spontaneously-occurring arteriolar ruptures will enlarge to cause clinically evident ICH, but anticoagulants do not appear to increase the incidence of asymptomatic cerebral microbleeds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-intracerebral-bleeding-in-patients-treated-with-anticoagulants/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Thus, anticoagulant therapy appears to &quot;unmask&quot; the inherent rate of spontaneous cerebral microbleeds as their most serious complication. As a result, patients at the highest risk for spontaneous ICH are those who are also at highest risk for anticoagulant-associated intracerebral bleeding.</p><p>This construct explains why intensities of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> anticoagulation that are rarely complicated by ICH in middle-aged people undergoing anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism (ie, patients with a very low inherent rate of spontaneous microbleeds) result in substantially increased absolute rates of ICH among anticoagulated octogenarians with atrial fibrillation, particularly if their blood pressure is not well controlled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-intracerebral-bleeding-in-patients-treated-with-anticoagulants/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>There is no lower threshold of anticoagulation intensity that does not accentuate the risk of warfarin-associated ICH. Although INRs above 4.0 are associated with high rates of ICH in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-intracerebral-bleeding-in-patients-treated-with-anticoagulants/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], most warfarin-associated ICHs occur at anticoagulation intensities that are within the conventional therapeutic range (ie, INRs in the range of 2.0 to 3.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-intracerebral-bleeding-in-patients-treated-with-anticoagulants/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>].

Since nasal bleeding (epistaxis) in aspirin users was a powerful independent risk factor for ICH in a case-control study, this suggests that the antiplatelet effect of aspirin is responsible for initiating clinically detected bleeding at both sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-intracerebral-bleeding-in-patients-treated-with-anticoagulants/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">REDUCING THE RISK OF ICH DURING ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency of warfarin-associated ICH is increasing due to the more widespread use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> in older adult patients with atrial fibrillation, and the concomitant use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and other antiplatelet agents in older patients.
