Patients typically present with acute paraparesis or quadriparesis, depending on the level of the spinal cord involved. The diagnosis is generally made clinically, with neuroimaging to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other conditions.</p><p>This topic discusses the clinical features and diagnosis of spinal cord infarction. The vascular anatomy of the spinal cord, and the etiologies, prognosis, treatment, and chronic complications of spinal cord infarction are discussed separately. Other causes of myelopathy are also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-cord-infarction-vascular-anatomy-and-etiologies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal cord infarction: Vascular anatomy and etiologies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-cord-infarction-prognosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal cord infarction: Prognosis and treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of spinal cord injury and disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders affecting the spinal cord&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-localization-of-spinal-cord-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with cerebral infarction, the onset of spinal cord infarction is typically abrupt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In a few cases, symptoms progress over several minutes or even a few hours. The neurologic presentation of spinal cord infarction is largely defined by the vascular territory involved. The severity of the impairments can vary widely, from paraplegia to minor weakness. The involved cord level can be anywhere along the cord's length, depending in part on the underlying etiology. Back or neck pain often accompanies spinal cord ischemia, and has been reported in as many as 70 percent of patients, typically occurring at the level of the lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/1-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Anterior spinal artery syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common clinical presentation of a spinal cord infarction is anterior spinal artery (ASA) syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,9</a>]. Consistent with its functional neuroanatomy, an ASA infarct typically presents as loss of motor function and <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/temperature</span> sensation, with relative sparing of proprioception and vibratory sense below the level of the lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The acute stages are characterized by flaccidity and loss of deep tendon reflexes; spasticity and hyperreflexia develop over ensuing days and weeks. Autonomic dysfunction may be present and can manifest as hypotension (either orthostatic or frank hypotension), sexual dysfunction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bowel and bladder dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11,12</a>]. Chest pain with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes has been reported in a patient with C7 to T1 spinal cord infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In the acute evaluation of patients, it is important to recognize that hypotension may be both a cause as well as a manifestation of spinal cord ischemia. If the lesion is in the rostral cervical cord, respiration is compromised.</p><p>While bilateral presentations are more common, unilateral ASA deficits are frequently reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,3-5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-5,14</a>]. This occurs either because of occlusion of a unilateral sulcal artery, or because incomplete collateralization with the posterior spinal artery (PSA) maintains perfusion on one side of the cord. Very rostral ASA infarctions produce sensory loss in all modalities because of involvement of the medial lemniscus in the medulla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Posterior spinal artery syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PSA infarction produces loss of proprioception and vibratory sense below the level of the injury and total anesthesia at the level of the injury. Weakness has been described, but is typically mild and transient. Unilateral involvement is more common, but bilateral presentations have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Other presentations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atypical presentations of spinal cord infarction that do not fit a well-defined vascular distribution include Brown-Sequard syndrome, full transverse lesions similar to that found in cord transection, and central cord syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-localization-of-spinal-cord-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders&quot;</a>). Additionally, we have observed cases of lower extremity weakness (unilateral and bilateral) without sensory loss. The etiology for this is unknown but likely relates to incomplete collateralization from the complex network of anastomosis that make up the spinal vascular supply. Among case series, these atypical, seemingly nonvascular syndromes compose one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Transient symptoms lasting a few minutes to several hours, so-called spinal transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), have also been described in a variety of clinical settings, but these are unusual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,4,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,15</a>].</p><p>Venous infarction of the spinal cord has been described, usually in association with spinal vascular malformations. These infarcts may be either hemorrhagic or nonhemorrhagic. In nonhemorrhagic venous infarcts, venous hypertension decreases the arterial-venous pressure gradient leading to decreased perfusion. Nonhemorrhagic venous infarction typically presents with a gradual onset of progressive neurologic decline, whereas hemorrhage is associated with the sudden onset of pain and flaccid paraparesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders affecting the spinal cord&quot;, section on 'Vascular malformations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While there are many potential causes of myelopathy, only a few present in an abrupt presentation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders affecting the spinal cord&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compressive myelopathy from neoplasm, epidural or subdural hematoma, or abscess is the most important category of diagnosis to exclude, as these often require urgent surgical decompression. While these lesions typically develop over time, the clinical presentation can be fairly abrupt and mimic spinal cord infarction. This diagnostic consideration mandates urgent neuroimaging in all patients presenting with spinal cord infarction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders affecting the spinal cord&quot;, section on 'Neoplasms'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-epidural-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal epidural abscess&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transverse myelitis is more typically associated with an evolution of myelopathic symptoms over hours and days, but these can develop in as short a period as 10 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. A history of recent vaccination or viral illness may suggest this diagnosis, but these are often absent. Symptoms isolated to the anterior spinal artery (ASA) territory suggest infarction over inflammation, but this is not definitive. Other diagnostic studies (lumbar puncture, brain imaging) may be required. Because individual clinical and diagnostic features are not sensitive or specific for either diagnosis, clinicians must consider the preponderance of the evidence when determining the more likely diagnosis. Clinical and diagnostic features that favor transverse myelitis over infarction include progression of symptoms over at least a few hours, symptoms and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions that extend beyond a vascular territory, gadolinium enhancement, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings of pleocytosis or elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders affecting the spinal cord&quot;, section on 'Transverse myelitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute polyneuropathy (eg, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome [GBS]) can be confused with acute myelopathy because both are associated with flaccidity and loss of reflexes in the acute stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above). Contributing to potential diagnostic confusion is that back pain is a common feature in both GBS and acute spinal cord infarction. A history of ascending symptoms over time suggests GBS, while a sensory level and impaired bladder function suggest spinal cord infarction. In some cases, differentiating these diagnoses requires diagnostic tests (MRI, electromyography) and the passage of time to allow upper motor neuron signs to emerge. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in adults: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the postoperative setting, the differential diagnosis of paraplegia includes an epidural hematoma, especially if the patient has had either a lumbar drain or epidural anesthesia. Although epidural hematoma usually has a more subacute presentation with evolution over time, this presentation may be obscured in the perioperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with acute dissection or rupture of the descending aorta, paraplegia may result from impaired perfusion of the brain and lower extremities, as well as from spinal ischemia. It is also possible for all three of these phenomena to occur simultaneously.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is required in the diagnosis of spinal cord infarction. Perhaps its most important role is to rule out the alternative diagnosis of compressive myelopathy. MRI can also provide confirmatory evidence of spinal cord infarction and may provide information as to the underlying etiology. In most cases, this test should be performed urgently, although it may be deferred if the patient requires urgent aortic surgery or another life-saving intervention.</p><p>MRI changes associated with spinal cord ischemia include hyperintensities on T2-weighted images (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F72280\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72280 \">image 1</a>). The sensitivity of standard MRI is limited, particularly in the first several hours. The percentage of patients with T2 changes on MRI scan in published reports ranges from 45 to 73 percent depending in part on the scan's timing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,4,5,11,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5,11,21,22</a>]. If clinical suspicion is high and the initial MRI is normal, follow-up imaging should be obtained. However, a significant minority of patients (14 percent in one series) will also have normal follow-up MRI scans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,22</a>]. A finding of restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted images (DWI-MRI) appears to be significantly more sensitive than standard T2 images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>]. While the limited number of case reports precludes a definitive estimate of its sensitivity, in one series of 19 patients with spinal cord infarction, restricted diffusion was found in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>A finding of T2 signal abnormality, even with restricted diffusion, is not specific for ischemia and can be seen in transverse myelitis and other intrinsic cord pathologies. When these findings are restricted to a vascular territory, they are more specific, but not perfectly so. A finding of vertebral body infarction adjacent to a cord signal abnormality on MRI is a specific indicator of ischemia and a useful confirmatory sign if present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, this is found in only 4 to 35 percent of patients, and its absence does not exclude spinal cord infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,7</a>].</p><p>MRI may also help define the underlying etiology:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intervertebral disc disease at the level of infarction may suggest possible fibrocartilaginous embolism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spondylotic disease may suggest a possible bony compression mechanism, particularly if the onset of symptoms is associated with activity involving twisting or torquing of the spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal cord vascular malformations also have distinct patterns of abnormalities that may be seen on MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders affecting the spinal cord&quot;, section on 'Vascular malformations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one case series, vertebral body infarction was highly associated with aortic disease pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Other tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Further testing is not always necessary. As an example, in the setting of paraplegia after aortic surgery, a patient with typical spine MRI findings will likely not require further testing. However, depending on the clinical presentation, other tests should be ordered to further exclude alternative diagnoses (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above) and to identify an underlying etiology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F57862\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57862 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic dissection can be identified by multiplane transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), chest computed tomography (CT), and MRI. While an uncommon cause of spinal cord infarction, aortic dissection can lead to serious adverse sequelae if unrecognized. Therefore, this should be considered and specifically excluded in high-risk patients. Such patients will include those who present with prominent pain, abnormal distal pulses, known aortic aneurysm, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an underlying collagen disorder (Marfan syndrome). A low threshold for this diagnosis should probably also include older adults with vascular risk factors in whom the underlying cause of spinal cord infarction is not immediately known. In patients with hemodynamic instability, this evaluation will take priority over spine imaging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular imaging, either CT angiography or magnetic resonance angiography, should be performed to exclude a vertebral artery dissection in a patient with a rostral cervical cord infarction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brain may be helpful to exclude multiple sclerosis if the clinical presentation is consistent with transverse myelitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiography can be performed to look for a source of embolism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis should be performed in younger patients to look for signs of infection or inflammatory diseases. CSF testing should include cell count, protein, glucose, Gram stain and culture, <span class=\"nowrap\">cytology/flow</span> cytometry, oligoclonal bands, as well as tests for syphilis, Lyme, herpes, varicella, and cytomegalovirus. Serum tests for syphilis, Lyme, HIV, enterovirus, coxsackie A and B, adenovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus may be of value. CSF analysis in spinal cord infarction is typically normal, but there can be pleocytosis (rarely more than 100 white blood cell count [WBC]) and an elevated protein (usually less than 119 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4,6,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,6,22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests to evaluate a possible hypercoagulable condition should be performed when the cause of spinal cord infarction is obscure, particularly in younger patients and those without vascular risk factors. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Urine or blood toxicology screen should exclude cocaine and other drugs of abuse. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Rheumatologic tests are likely of low yield if there are no other suggestive clinical features, but these tests (sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and <span class=\"nowrap\">SSA/B</span> antibodies) could be considered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A dedicated spinal angiogram is indicated when a vascular malformation is considered a possible etiology. In general, this is performed when the spine MRI has suspicious findings or when a patient presents with recurrent events. It may also be reasonable to consider this test in patients without recurrent events when the clinical suspicion for a vascular malformation is high. Despite the invasive nature of spinal angiography, observational studies suggest that in experienced hands, the complications are infrequent (1 to 2 percent) and do not involve significant morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-infarction-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].
