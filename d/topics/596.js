It typically presents as bilateral ocular pruritus, redness, and watery discharge. This topic discusses the management of allergic conjunctivitis. The clinical manifestations, epidemiology, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-conjunctivitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic conjunctivitis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An overview of conjunctivitis and detailed reviews of other types of conjunctivitis are found elsewhere.

For those allergic to dust mites, helpful measures include replacing old pillows, blankets, and mattresses; using dust mite allergen impermeable covers for pillows, comforters, and mattresses; frequently washing beddings; reducing humidity; and frequently vacuuming and dusting the home. Additionally, other reservoirs of dust should be removed, such as old carpets, old furniture, and old curtains or drapes. When the culprit allergen is animal dander, the animal may need to be removed from the home, and old carpets, furniture, and curtains should be removed or cleaned thoroughly. The avoidance and reduction of indoor allergen levels are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergen-avoidance-in-the-treatment-of-asthma-and-allergic-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergen avoidance in the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Avoidance measures for indoor allergens can be expensive, and some clinicians prefer to pursue testing for sensitivity to specific allergens by an allergist prior to recommending involved allergen remediation measures. (See <a href=\"#H12817893\" class=\"local\">'Referral'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12816843\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The therapies used in the management of allergic conjunctivitis and the mechanisms of action, dosing, and adverse effects are discussed in this section. Treatment strategies for specific disorders are discussed subsequently. (See <a href=\"#H30291399\" class=\"local\">'Treatment for specific disorders'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12816850\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical therapies include <span class=\"nowrap\">antihistamine/vasoconstrictor</span> combination products, antihistamines with mast cell-stabilizing properties, mast cell stabilizers, and for refractory symptoms, topical glucocorticoids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F91098\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91098 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12816857\"><span class=\"h3\">Vasoconstrictor/antihistamine combinations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eye drops containing both an antihistamine and a vasoconstrictor are widely available without a prescription. Although we do not specifically recommend these products if a patient presents for treatment, some patients have accessed these medications on their own. The antihistamine component competitively and reversibly blocks histamine receptors in the conjunctiva and eyelids, thus inhibiting the actions of the primary mast cell-derived mediator. The vasoconstrictor component activates the postjunctional, alpha-adrenergic receptors found in blood vessels, causing vasoconstriction and decreased conjunctival edema. Examples of topical <span class=\"nowrap\">antihistamine/vasoconstrictor</span> drugs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naphazoline-ophthalmic-nasal-decongestant-preparation-is-not-available-in-united-states-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naphazoline</a> and pheniramine (available as Naphcon-A, Opcon-A, Visine-A, and others [brand names]). Dosing is up to four times daily during acute symptoms.</p><p>These topical medications are appropriate for short-term (eg, less than two weeks) or episodic use only. Regular use for longer than two weeks can lead to rebound hyperemia because of the vasoconstrictor component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients should understand that they may have increased eye redness for several days when they stop using these medications. (See <a href=\"#H20574978\" class=\"local\">'Acute allergic conjunctivitis'</a> below.)</p><p>Single agent topical products (ie, vasoconstrictors or antihistamines only) are also available without a prescription, although the combination products usually work better [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12817219\"><span class=\"h3\">Antihistamines with mast cell-stabilizing properties</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antihistamines with mast cell-stabilizing properties include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olopatadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olopatadine</a> (Patanol, Pataday, Pazeo [brand names]), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alcaftadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alcaftadine</a> (Lastacaft [brand name]), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bepotastine-ophthalmic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bepotastine</a> (Bepreve [brand name]), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azelastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azelastine</a> hydrochloride (Optivar [brand name]), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinastine</a> (Elestat [brand name]), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketotifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketotifen</a> fumarate (Ketotifen [brand name]), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emedastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emedastine</a> (Emadine [brand name]). Ketotifen fumarate is available in a generic formulation and does not require a prescription (in the United States).</p><p>These agents have two main actions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As antihistamines, they competitively and reversibly block histamine receptors in the conjunctiva and eyelids, thus inhibiting the actions of the primary mast cell-derived mediator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This also helps reduce the late phase of the allergic response.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As mast cell stabilizers, they inhibit mast cell degranulation, limiting the release of histamine, tryptase, and prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub> (PGD<sub>2</sub>). Release of these proinflammatory mast cell mediators is the first step in the allergic cascade. These drugs also inhibit leukocyte activity and dampen mediator release from basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>Dosing is twice per day for most products. Pataday, Pazeo, and Lastacaft (brand names) are once daily preparations. Onset of action is within minutes for most drugs. However, at least two weeks of therapy should be allowed in order to assess the full efficacy of prophylactic therapy with these agents, since it may take some time for the inflammation to be controlled and symptoms to subside completely.</p><p>Common side effects include stinging and burning upon instillation. Patients may find it helpful to refrigerate the drops <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> use refrigerated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a> before using these medications. Other adverse effects include headache and increased ocular dryness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12816871\"><span class=\"h3\">Mast cell stabilizers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mast cell-stabilizing agents include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cromolyn</a> sodium (Opticrom [brand name]), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nedocromil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nedocromil</a> (Alocril [brand name]), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lodoxamide-tromethamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lodoxamide</a> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tromethamine-tham-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tromethamine</a> (Alomide [brand name]), and pemirolast (Alamast [brand name]). Full efficacy is reached 5 to 14 days after therapy has been initiated, and therefore, these medicines are <strong>not</strong> useful for acute symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, dosing of mast cell stabilizers is four times daily, compared with twice daily, for most agents with combined actions. Because of these limitations, mast cell stabilizers are often impractical, but they may provide an option for patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) who do not tolerate other therapies and can anticipate when their symptoms will start. Such patients should begin treatment two to four weeks before the pollen season. However, for most patients, antihistamines with mast cell-stabilizing properties are more convenient and effective:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One randomized study compared the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cromolyn</a> sodium (4 percent, four times daily) for two weeks prior to allergen challenge with a single drop of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketotifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketotifen</a> fumarate (0.025 percent) given just before allergen challenge. The single drop of ketotifen fumarate was superior in controlling itching and redness at 15 minutes and at 4 hours after challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis comparing the economic cost with the United Kingdom's National Health Service of prescribing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olopatadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olopatadine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cromolyn</a> concluded that the more expensive olopatadine resulted in sufficiently fewer return visits than it was for the more cost-effective option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12817008\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) block the action of cyclooxygenase and inhibit the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and thromboxanes. Topical NSAIDs do have efficacy compared with placebo in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, they are less effective than topical antihistamines and thus have limited utility in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-management/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12817014\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical glucocorticoid preparations may be considered in patients with refractory symptoms. However, they have potentially serious side effects that can be vision-threatening, and their use should be supervised by an ophthalmologist. (See <a href=\"#H20575014\" class=\"local\">'Refractory symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>Glucocorticoids suppress the late-phase reaction of allergic inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. They inhibit phospholipase A2 and consequently, reduce the formation of lipid-derived mediators from arachidonic acid. This prevents leukocyte migration, hydrolytic enzyme release, fibroblast growth, and changes in vascular permeability.</p><p>Topical glucocorticoids should <strong>only be used</strong> for short &quot;pulse therapy&quot; (two weeks maximal duration) in patients for whom antihistamines with mast cell-stabilizing properties have not controlled symptoms adequately. Ocular side effects from glucocorticoids can be vision-threatening and include cataract formation, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), glaucoma, and secondary infections.</p><p>&quot;Soft&quot; steroids are a group of topical glucocorticoids that have a greatly reduced risk of causing increased IOP since they are formulated such that they undergo rapid inactivation upon penetration of the cornea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. &quot;Soft&quot; steroids include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loteprednol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loteprednol</a> (Lotemax and Alrex [brand names]), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rimexolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rimexolone</a> (Vexol [brand name]), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> (Pred Mild [brand name]), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorometholone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorometholone</a> (FML [brand name]), and medrysone (HMS [brand name]). The side effect risk profile is lowest with the newer-generation steroids (loteprednol and rimexolone). Loteprednol is also available as a suspension, as a gel, and in 0.2 and 0.5 percent concentrations.</p><p>&quot;Soft&quot; steroids are administered two to four times per day for approximately two weeks. This can help slow the immune response so that the mast cell stabilizers, antihistamines, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a> have a greater chance to work. In contrast, use of these medications for greater than six weeks is associated with a significantly increased risk of complications.</p><p>Topical glucocorticoids that have a much higher risk of raising IOP include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> acetate (1 percent) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> phosphate (0.1 percent). We do not recommend use of these agents by clinicians who are not experts in ophthalmology. These preparations are indicated for severe inflammation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4516195\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of multiple eye drops</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients using multiple types of eye drops, such as a topical medication and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a>, it is advisable to space drops a few (three to five) minutes apart if possible, so that instillation of a second drop does not wash out the first. These recommendations need to be balanced with the lifestyle limitations and realities faced by the patient. In addition, closure of the eyelids for a few seconds after drug instillation helps absorption into ocular tissues. In contrast, repetitive blinking should be avoided as much as possible, as it generates negative pressure and causes topical medications to wash out of the ocular surface more quickly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12816885\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral antihistamines are often used in the management of allergic conjunctivitis that is associated with nonocular symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12816892\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral antihistamines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonsedating over-the-counter or prescription oral H1 antihistamines may be helpful for patients who also report rhinitis and generalized pruritus. However, when ocular symptoms are the main presenting problem, topical (ocular) medications are preferred because they are faster-acting and less likely to cause systemic side effects. In addition, randomized trials have shown that topical medications are more effective than oral therapies for ocular symptoms. Specifically, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olopatadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olopatadine</a> was more effective than oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loratadine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fexofenadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fexofenadine</a>, and topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketotifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketotifen</a> was more effective than oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desloratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desloratadine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-management/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. In addition, oral antihistamines can cause drying of mucosal membranes and decreased tear production in some patients, especially those with concomitant dry eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H30291063\" class=\"local\">'Concomitant dry eyes'</a> below.)</p><p>Nonsedating oral antihistamines available without a prescription include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fexofenadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fexofenadine</a> (Allegra [brand name]), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loratadine</a> (Claritin [brand name]), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a> (Zyrtec [brand name]). Cetirizine causes sedation in up to 10 percent of patients, despite its categorization as nonsedating. In the United States, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desloratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desloratadine</a> (Clarinex [brand name]) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levocetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levocetirizine</a> (Xyzal [brand name]) require a prescription.

Oral administration of antihistamines results in peak serum levels in 30 minutes to 3 hours, depending on the specific drug. Full effects are seen after several days of use. Thus, these agents have a slower onset of action compared with topical agents, although this is not relevant if they are taken prophylactically.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30291399\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT FOR SPECIFIC DISORDERS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20574978\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute allergic conjunctivitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of acute allergic conjunctivitis are self-limited (usually lasting less than 24 hours) and do not require long-term treatment.

Patients with coexisting allergic rhinitis and asthma that is not well-controlled are also candidates for referral.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Allergy specialists can assist the patient in the correct identification and avoidance of the culprit allergens, help guide pharmacotherapy, and offer allergen immunotherapy to appropriate patients. Injection (subcutaneous) allergen immunotherapy is the best established form of immunotherapy. Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is a three- to five-year process that involves the gradual administration of increasing amounts of allergen to induce protective immunologic responses. Sublingual forms of immunotherapy are also available for some allergens. Immunotherapy is the only means of altering the abnormal immune response that underlies allergic disease in a semipermanent manner.

All patients with allergic conjunctivitis who do not respond fully to the standard treatments outlined above should be evaluated for concomitant dry eyes by an eye care practitioner. The ophthalmologist will perform a slit lamp evaluation, along with other testing, to assess the status of the patient's lacrimal functional unit in order to determine the severity of dry eye disease and possible etiologies. Simply asking whether the eyes feel dry may not adequately detect affected patients, as those with mild-to-moderate dry eyes may not report symptoms. Dry eye is mentioned briefly here and discussed in more detail separately.
