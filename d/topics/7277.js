As a result, management of neonatal fluid and electrolyte therapy is challenging as these factors and the clinical setting need to be accounted for while caring for neonates, especially preterm infants.</p><p>Fluid and electrolyte therapy in newborns, including the underlying principles of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis, determination of fluid and electrolyte requirements, influence of the care environment (eg, radiant warmers, humidity), and management of electrolyte and water abnormalities is discussed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1024902783\"><span class=\"h1\">WATER AND ELECTROLYTE HOMEOSTASIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Water and electrolyte balance is primarily dependent on renal function and fluid intake versus losses. However, a newborn is more susceptible to derangements in water and electrolyte homeostasis because of the normal postnatal changes in body water components, functional immaturity of the neonatal kidney, increased insensible water losses compared with older individuals, and an inability to independently access water. In particular, the magnitude of postnatal diuresis, immaturity of renal function, and insensible fluid loss is higher at lower gestational age (GA). Thus, it is important for the clinician caring for the neonate, especially very preterm (VPT) infants, to have an understanding of the basic physiologic mechanisms that regulate and maintain water and electrolyte balance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115961794\"><span class=\"h2\">Changes in total body water</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total body water (TBW) is composed of extracellular fluid (ECF), which includes intravascular and interstitial fluid, and intracellular fluid. The amount of TBW as a percentage of body weight and its distribution in various fluid compartments vary with GA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As an example, in a newborn term infant, the TBW is 75 percent of the body weight as compared with 80 percent in an infant born at 27 weeks gestation; the ECF volumes are 45 and 70 percent, respectively. </p><p>After birth, there is a physiologic diuresis of ECF resulting in a weight loss during the first week of life. The magnitude of diuresis and relative weight loss decreases with increasing GA. Normal weight loss is approximately 10 to 15 percent in preterm and 5 percent for term breastfed infants in the first day of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Fluid loss results primarily from an isotonic reduction in extracellular water, although the mechanism for this process is uncertain. The postnatal diuresis is approximately 1 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour in term infants and is greater in preterm infants. Since fluid administration in these infants is entirely regulated by caregivers, recognition of normal physiologic fluid loss is a major determinant for fluid management. In addition, other concomitant fluid losses vary depending on the clinical setting. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Sources of water loss'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2237580371\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluid and electrolytes homeostasis in preterm infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prospective studies involving very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (BW &le;1500 g) and extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (BW &le;1000 g) demonstrated a consistent pattern of fluid and sodium homeostasis despite varying intakes of sodium and water over the first five to seven days of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Results demonstrated that in these preterm neonates there were three consistent phases of water and sodium changes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pre-diuretic phase &ndash; Day 1 of life is characterized by oliguria with low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and low fractional excretion of sodium (FENa). It is speculated that birth-associated renal nerve stimulation increases renal vascular resistance, thus GFR and renal flow are suppressed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diuretic and natriuretic phase &ndash; Days 2 to 3 of life are characterized by both increased urine output and sodium losses caused by increased GFR and high FENa. In this second phase, lung fluid is thought to be absorbed, resulting in increased extracellular volume. This leads to inhibition of sympathetic activity with subsequent reduced renal vascular resistance causing an increase in GFR, FENa, and urine output.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-diuretic phase &ndash; Days 4 to 5 are characterized by varied urine output dependent upon changes in fluid intake, with a reduction of GFR and FENa compared with days 2 to 3. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3067593569\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal renal function is varied due to: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Developmental immaturity &ndash; Renal function improves with increasing GA.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postnatal hemodynamic changes at birth that affect renal function. The magnitude and rate of changes vary with GA</p><p/><p>Developmental immaturity, especially in the preterm infant, affects the following renal functions, which can result in water and electrolyte imbalance:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glomerular filtration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ability to concentrate urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tubular reabsorption of sodium and bicarbonate and secretion of potassium and hydrogen</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H652883831\"><span class=\"h3\">Glomerular filtration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Embryogenesis is complete by approximately 35 weeks gestation, at which time there are between 0.6 and 1.2 million nephrons in each kidney. As a result, GFR in preterm infants with GAs below 35 weeks is lower. So, for example, a full term infant has a GFR of approximately 26 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, whereas a preterm infant at 27 weeks gestation will have a GFR of 13.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>GFR increases at birth in all infants due to recruitment of superficial nephrons and a substantial increase in renal blood flow (RBF) due to a decrease in renal vascular resistance and increases in systemic blood pressure. However, the velocity of change is greater in term infants compared with preterm infants, especially VPT infants. So for term infants, GFR doubles by two weeks of age to 54 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> compared with a GFR of 16.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2 </sup>for a neonate born at 27 weeks gestation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H875051957\"><span class=\"h4\">Serum creatinine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinically, serum creatinine (SCr) values are the most convenient method to estimate GFR. Similar to GFR, SCr normally varies with GA and postnatal age. At birth, SCr concentration is the same as the concentration in the mother (usually less than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [88 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]),</span> and normally falls over time. For term infants, the decline is rapid to nadir values (SCr 0.2 to 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [18 to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> by the first or second week of life. For preterm newborns, the decline is slower, and may take up to two months to reach normal baseline (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111831\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111831 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-acute-kidney-injury-pathogenesis-etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis#H1201172310\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal acute kidney injury: Pathogenesis, etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Serum creatinine'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of either acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease (CKD) is suspected with an abnormally elevated serum creatinine (SCr) for GA and postnatal age or increasing SCr from a previous baseline.

The maximum urine concentration that can be achieved increases from 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> in the first few days after birth to 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> at one year of age. As a result, the risk of volume depletion is increased in the newborn because of the inability to maximally concentrate urine and due to increased insensible fluid loss compared with older individuals. If fluid repletion is inadequate, this results in hypovolemia and hypernatremia. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Sources of water loss'</a> below.)</p><p>Limited concentrating ability in newborn infants is due to the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited tonicity of the medullary osmotic gradient &ndash; This is due in part to the short loop of Henle in newborns that restricts the countercurrent multiplication that forms the osmotic gradient from the corticomedullary junction to the inner medulla. In addition, tonicity within the medullary interstitium is limited by reduced availability of osmolar molecules (eg, urea) due to a low dietary intake of sodium and protein from human milk and formula and reduced urea synthesis due to the typical anabolic state of the newborn.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminished response to antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also referred to as arginine vasopressin) &ndash; ADH increases the water permeability of the collecting tubule by activation of its receptors. In the newborn, the collecting tubule is relatively unresponsive to changes in ADH, and the response diminishes with decreasing GA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>Concentrating ability matures after birth, but the pace of this maturation is lower in infants of lower GA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H990842177\"><span class=\"h3\">Other tubular function</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sodium &ndash; In the neonate, maximum reabsorption of sodium is limited due to tubular immaturity and tubuloglomerular imbalance, which improves with increasing GA. Limited sodium reabsorption is in part due to reduced responsiveness to aldosterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Sodium transport throughout the kidney also depends on the Na-K-ATPase pump located on the basolateral membrane of various sections of the tubule and membrane transporters. In the neonate, especially VPT infants (GA &lt;32 weeks), the immature developmental expression and function of the Na-K-ATPase pump and membrane transporters result in decreased sodium reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. As a result, the fraction of the filtered sodium that is excreted (FENa) is as high as 5 percent in preterm infants less than 30 weeks gestation compared with less than 2 percent in older infants and children. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bicarbonate &ndash; Bicarbonate resorption in the proximal tubule is reduced due to decreased expression and activity of the NA-K-ATPase pump and carbonic anhydrase and sodium-hydrogen antiporter. This leads to a lower resorptive threshold for bicarbonate of 19 to 21 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> in term infants, and 16 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> in preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potassium &ndash; Potassium excretion primarily occurs in the gastrointestinal tract, with only approximately 10 to 15 percent excreted in the urine. In the neonate, this excretion is dependent largely on the NA-K-ATPase pump. Low renal excretion is due to the decreased expression and activity of this pump, decreased responsiveness of the neonatal kidney to aldosterone, and lower GFR. This leads to higher normal values of potassium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86501\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86501 \">table 2</a>) and an increased risk of hyperkalemia, especially in ill preterm infants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of hyperkalemia in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Sources of water loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Water loss is divided into insensible losses through the skin and lungs, and sensible losses through the kidney (urine output). The absolute and relative amounts of water loss through these routes change with GA. Other fluid losses may include stool, gastric drainage, ileostomy drainage, or thoracostomy output.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Renal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After birth, most neonates demonstrate low urinary volume &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> perhour) in the first day of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. After 24 hours of life, urine output (sensible losses) increases and is approximately 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day, or 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour. As noted above, neonates have a limited ability to concentrate their urine. (See <a href=\"#H430088980\" class=\"local\">'Urinary concentration'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaporation through the skin can result in large insensible water losses in newborns. These may be excessive in extremely low birth weight (ELBW; BW &lt;1000 g) infants with very thin skin (increased skin permeability). In addition, the surface area-to-volume (related to body weight) ratio increases with deceasing GA, which also increases fluid loss.</p><p>As the skin matures with increasing GA and postnatal age, the surface area-to-volume ratio decreases and evaporative loss is reduced. These factors are less significant for infants born after 28 weeks GA. For more immature infants, these losses become less important one week after birth. As an example, insensible water loss in an infant born at 24 weeks gestation may be as high as 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day compared with a loss of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day for a term infant. Water loss also may be excessive in conditions in which skin integrity is compromised (eg, epidermolysis bullosa, abdominal wall defect) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p>Other factors that may increase skin losses include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiant warmers, which increase evaporative water loss by approximately 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Use of humidification and plastic wrap may minimize this loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Newer incubators that provide humidification and easier access to infants have been developed, resulting in a decreased use of radiant warmers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heat-emitting phototherapy devices, which increase transepidermal water loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. However, these devices are rapidly being replaced by newer ones using high-intensity gallium nitride light-emitting diode (LED) phototherapy, which have no effect on transepidermal water loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Respiratory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the typical ambient humidity in the nursery, approximately one-half of insensible losses in term infants are caused by water loss through the respiratory system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Respiratory loss increases with increasing respiratory rate and decreases for infants who receive humidified air, including those who are intubated and mechanically ventilated. Although respiratory water loss increases with decreasing GA, transepidermal loss increases even more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Thus, in preterm infants, skin water loss is greater than respiratory loss. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of antenatal glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antenatal administration of glucocorticoids to promote lung maturation in preterm infants also results in maturation of the skin and kidneys (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antenatal-corticosteroid-therapy-for-reduction-of-neonatal-respiratory-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preterm-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery&quot;</a>). </p><p>In one report, water and sodium homeostasis during the first week after birth were compared in ELBW infants exposed and not exposed to antenatal glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Exposed infants had lower insensible water loss, less hypernatremia, and an earlier diuresis and natriuresis than unexposed infants. These changes were thought to result from enhanced epithelial cell maturation that improved the barrier function of the skin. In experimental studies, glucocorticoid exposure resulted in maturation of ion channels in the proximal renal tubular epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>In another report, exposure to antenatal glucocorticoids prevented nonoliguric hyperkalemia that frequently occurs in ELBW infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The mechanism is uncertain, but may be related to enhanced stabilization of cell membranes and upregulation of Na-K-ATPase activity, leading to a decrease in the movement of potassium from intracellular to extracellular compartments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H342059621\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluid and electrolyte management in the newborn is made more difficult by several factors that include gestational age (GA), postnatal age, and the clinical setting (environmental factors, severity of illness, and therapeutic intervention). It is important to be aware of variations in lab values at different GAs for appropriate neonatal fluid and electrolyte management. Monitoring and consideration of the various concomitant and changing factors are essential to correcting and maintaining optimal balance of fluid and electrolytes in newborns. Management requires performing serial physical examinations, including measuring (and interpreting) body weight, monitoring intake and output, and frequent serial measurements of serum sodium. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical examination begins with a general assessment of the patient, including determining GA and postnatal age. These factors affect the degree of water loss (especially skin loss). Other factors that will influence fluid losses and need to be considered include loss of skin integrity and the use of humidified air or radiant heater. As care proceeds, serial examination should include daily weights, signs of cardiovascular stability (heart rate, blood pressure, capillary refill), state of hydration (skin turgor, mucus membrane status, fullness of the anterior fontanelle), and the presence or absence of edema. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1780984960\"><span class=\"h3\">Body weight</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Body weight should be measured at least daily and in some cases more frequently. There is an expected physiologic weight loss in the first several days of life of 5 to 10 percent in term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and as high as 15 percent in preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>With appropriate nutrition and fluid intake, weight typically reaches a nadir at approximately three to four days and rebounds to near birth weight (BW) by seven days, although a significant percentage of otherwise normal infants may not regain BW for 14 days or longer. The absence of this normal weight loss or weight gain over the first few days suggests excess fluid intake or abnormally low losses. </p><p>However, it is important to note that body weight measurements in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (BW &lt;1000 g) may be unreliable or subject to technical errors. In some neonatal units, routine weights to minimize handing of these extremely preterm (EPT) infants are not obtained until several days after birth. In other units, weights are measured but considered in the context of all clinical information. The addition of built-in scales as part of the radiant <span class=\"nowrap\">warmer/incubator</span> has made obtaining daily weights easier to achieve.</p><p>When weight measurements are available, changes are obviously dependent on adequate nutrition as well as hydration status. Body weight changes in conjunction with serum sodium concentration are the best measure of fluid status. The frequency of serial electrolyte measurements is increased when there is fluid and electrolyte imbalance. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Serum sodium'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excess body water is suggested by weight gain often in conjunction with a low serum sodium concentration. In infants with diminished renal function, volume overload may be identified by an increase in blood pressure and physical findings of generalized edema. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate fluid intake (hypovolemia) is manifested by excessive weight loss, a high sodium concentration, tachycardia, and poor capillary refill. In the most severe cases, hypotension may be observed as a prelude to neonatal shock. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-neonatal-shock#H2476094777\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, evaluation, and management of neonatal shock&quot;, section on 'Physical findings'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-low-blood-pressure-in-extremely-preterm-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, evaluation, and management of low blood pressure in extremely preterm infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decrease in effective circulation can occur when third spacing takes place, such as with sepsis or ileus.

The estimated insensible fluid loss is adjusted based on body weight changes outside of the normal range and abnormal sodium levels. For example, in an EPT infant, an estimation of insensible loss of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> is inadequate if there is an excess weight loss and a concomitant increase in serum sodium. In this case, the estimated insensible fluid loss should be increased, resulting in an increase in intake, which is reflected by a corresponding increase in the net difference between intake and output. (See <a href=\"#H115961794\" class=\"local\">'Changes in total body water'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Sources of water loss'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum sodium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serial serum or plasma sodium determinations are essential for monitoring the fluid and electrolyte balance of ill neonates, including EPT infants (GA &lt;28 weeks). When body weights are used in conjunction with serum sodium determinations, the etiology of any sodium derangement and plan for treatment can more readily be established. During the first days of life, changes in sodium concentration primarily reflect changes in water intake and loss, and not changes in sodium balance.

This likely results from excessive fluid intake or, infrequently, water retention due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).

It is most commonly seen as a result of inadequate replacement of large renal sodium losses in extremely preterm (EPT) infant (gestational age [GA] &le;28 weeks) due to immature tubular function or infants who receive diuretic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>In these patients, correction of hyponatremia is based on the repletion of the sodium deficit. This is calculated as the product of the total body volume times the sodium deficit per liter (ie, 140 minus the serum sodium concentration). The volume of distribution of sodium is the total body water because of the rapid osmotic equilibration between the extracellular and intracellular fluid. Although the total body water is 75 percent in normal term infants and increases with immaturity, most clinicians use a volume of distribution of 60 percent to minimize the likelihood of overly rapid correction. Sodium intake also needs to provide maintenance sodium based on the patient's ongoing needs. </p><p>Rarely, hyponatremia is caused by congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which may present as hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and shock in the newborn. This disorder most commonly is diagnosed as part of the standard newborn screening. For these patients, management includes correction of hypovolemia with normal saline followed by repletion of the sodium deficit along with appropriate replacement steroids.

Hypovolemia and hypernatremia result from inadequate fluid replacement of fluid loss due to insensible water loss (skin and respiratory loss) and urine (inability for maximal urinary concentration). In full term infants, this is most frequently caused by inadequate breastfeeding resulting in insufficient water replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].
