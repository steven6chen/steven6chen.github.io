In contrast to women with pregestational diabetes, women with true GDM typically do not have diabetes-related vasculopathy or an increased risk of infants with congenital malformations because of the short duration of the disorder and late pregnancy onset.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1185130493\"><span class=\"h2\">Short-term</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of pregnancy more common in GDM include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Large for gestational age (LGA) infant and</strong> <strong>macrosomia</strong> &ndash; LGA and macrosomia are the most common adverse neonatal outcomes associated with GDM. A prospective cohort study observed that accelerated fetal growth may begin as early as 20 to 28 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Randomized trials have consistently demonstrated that maternal hyperglycemia significantly increases a woman's chances of having a macrosomic or LGA infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>], and excessive maternal weight gain (&gt;40 lbs [18 kg]) doubles the risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Macrosomia, in turn, is associated with an increased risk of operative delivery (cesarean or instrumental vaginal) and adverse neonatal outcomes, such as shoulder dystocia and its associated complications: brachial plexus injury, fracture, and neonatal depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>]. Truncal asymmetry (disproportion in the ratio of the size of the shoulder or abdomen-to-head) in infants of diabetic mothers also appears to increase the risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In one report, the prevalence of LGA among normal weight and obese women without GDM was 7.7 and 12.7 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. For women with GDM, the prevalence of LGA for normal weight and obese women was almost two-fold higher: 13.6 and 22.3 percent, respectively. Although illustrative, multiple factors affect birthweight, including maternal weight, gestational weight gain, and glycemic control.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preeclampsia</strong> &ndash; Women with GDM are at higher risk of developing preeclampsia than women without GDM. Insulin resistance is the cause of GDM and also appears to be associated with development of preeclampsia, which may account for this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>]. A significant association (OR 1.3-3.1) between midtrimester insulin resistance and development of preeclampsia has been reported in several studies, even in the absence of GDM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Polyhydramnios </strong>&ndash; Polyhydramnios is more common in women with GDM.

Two studies reported GDM-related polyhydramnios did not significantly increase perinatal morbidity or mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>], while a third study reported a markedly increased risk of stillbirth in all nonanomalous pregnancies with polyhydramnios, whether or not also complicated by GDM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

This risk appears to be related primarily to poor glycemic control and does not appear to be increased compared with the general obstetrical population in women with good glycemic control, though ascertainment of such control can be challenging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neonatal morbidity</strong> &ndash; Neonates of pregnancies complicated by GDM are at increased risk of multiple, often transient, morbidities, including hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, polycythemia, respiratory distress, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. These risks are related, in large part, to maternal hyperglycemia.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of antepartum fetal surveillance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The evidence supporting antenatal fetal testing in pregnancies complicated by GDM consists primarily of data from observational series that report no or rare fetal losses among a group of pregnancies monitored by various antenatal testing regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. There are no randomized trials evaluating antenatal obstetrical management of women with GDM specifically, and findings from the small number of cohort and case-control studies are inconclusive.</p><p>The practice pattern that has evolved is to base use of fetal testing on (1) the severity of GDM (ie, whether euglycemia is achieved and whether it is achieved by nutritional <span class=\"nowrap\">therapy/exercise</span> or by pharmacologic therapy) and (2) the presence of other risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcome (eg, advanced maternal age, past history of stillbirth, presence of comorbidities such as chronic hypertension).</p><p>The timing for initiating testing in the third trimester, the frequency of testing, and the tests utilized (eg, nonstress test, biophysical profile score) vary by institution and practice setting.</p><p>As some studies have reported that women with GDM are at increased risk of stillbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>], we agree with expert opinion, which generally recommends that women who require insulin or an oral antihyperglycemic agent (ie, class A2 GDM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79735\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79735 \">table 1</a>)) to maintain euglycemia or who have poorly controlled blood glucose levels should be managed the same way as women with pregestational diabetes or other conditions placing the pregnancy at increased risk of adverse outcome. These women typically undergo periodic antenatal testing, usually initiated at about 32 weeks of gestation. Although we perform nonstress tests with an amniotic fluid index twice per week, there is no strong evidence favoring twice weekly testing over weekly testing or initiating testing at 32 weeks versus later in gestation. Other medical centers begin nonstress testing weekly at 32 weeks and increase to twice weekly at 36 weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F94336\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94336 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has suggested antenatal fetal assessment beginning at 32 weeks of gestation for all women treated with insulin or oral agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1640847273\"><span class=\"h3\">Women euglycemic on nutritional therapy alone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast, there is some evidence that women who are euglycemic with nutritional therapy alone (ie, class A1 GDM) and who have no other pregnancy complications (eg, no macrosomia, preeclampsia, growth restriction, polyhydramnios or oligohydramnios) are not at increased risk of stillbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]; therefore, omitting antenatal fetal surveillance (nonstress testing or biophysical profile scoring) is a reasonable approach for these women, but given the range of existing data on this issue, practice varies.</p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has suggested antenatal fetal assessment beginning at 32 weeks of gestation for women with GDM and poor glycemic control on nutritional therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. No specific recommendations were made for fetal assessment in patients with well-controlled GDM on nutritional therapy, except for assessment of amniotic fluid volume. This decision was left to local practice patterns. However, assessment can be begun closer to or at term since no increased risk of stillbirth has been demonstrated before 40 weeks in this population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of fetal growth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform a single third trimester ultrasound examination at 36 to 39 weeks to estimate fetal weight in all women with GDM, regardless of degree of metabolic control or requirement for insulin or oral anti-hyperglycemic agents. Identification of accelerated fetal growth before delivery may be useful to identify maternal-fetal pairs who may benefit from scheduled cesarean delivery to avoid trauma from shoulder dystocia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Some clinicians also obtain an ultrasound examination early in the third trimester to identify fetal growth acceleration as this appears to be a sign of nonoptimal glycemic control (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-macrosomia#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal macrosomia&quot;, section on 'Women with diabetes'</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Others use the information to identify maternal-fetal pairs that may benefit from induction of labor before the fetus grows too large. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies#H1000006244\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shoulder dystocia: Risk factors and planning delivery of high-risk pregnancies&quot;, section on 'Planning delivery in high-risk pregnancies'</a>.)</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no method of fetal growth assessment that performs well; all current methods are neither particularly sensitive nor specific, especially for identifying the large for gestational age (LGA) fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. One review of pregnant women with diabetes treated with insulin found that the sonographically estimated fetal weight had to be &ge;4800 grams for there to be at least a 50 percent chance the infant's birthweight would be &ge;4500 grams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Studies in nondiabetic pregnancies report similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Investigators have tried to find a more sensitive modality to estimate fetal weight, but there is little evidence that these experimental modalities can improve on existing two-dimensional ultrasound technology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-54</a>]. The diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">LGA/macrosomia</span> is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-macrosomia#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal macrosomia&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-macrosomia#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal macrosomia&quot;, section on 'Women with diabetes'</a>.)</p><p>In view of these limitations, a broad spectrum of practice has evolved, ranging from a single ultrasound at 36 weeks of gestation to assess the potential for macrosomia to frequent ultrasounds to monitor fetal growth (eg, at 28, 32, and 36 weeks of gestation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Similar to the situation with antenatal testing, some providers do not monitor fetal growth sonographically in euglycemic women with A1 GDM (medical nutritional therapy alone) because of concern that false-positive findings will lead to iatrogenic complications. As an example, one study reported an increase in cesarean delivery among women who had a third trimester ultrasound examination, even after controlling for birthweight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the key issues of the management of women with GDM is whether to induce labor and, if so, when? The major potential benefits of induction are avoidance of late stillbirth and avoidance of delivery-related complications of continued fetal growth, such as shoulder dystocia or cesarean delivery. The potential disadvantages include the risks of induction (eg, longer labor, neonatal morbidity in deliveries &lt;39 weeks). The optimal timing of delivery in GDM has not been evaluated in well-designed trials; the available data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/57-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-63</a>] are inadequate to allow a strong evidence-based recommendation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. However, increasing evidence suggests that induction of labor does not consistently lead to higher cesarean delivery rates than expectant management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/62,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1185133224\"><span class=\"h3\">A1 GDM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach, and the practice pattern that has evolved in many institutions, is to manage pregnancies of women who remain euglycemic with nutritional therapy and exercise alone (A1 GDM) by beginning a discussion about the possibility of induction of labor when the woman reaches her estimated date of delivery, 40+0 weeks of gestation, and recommending induction when she reaches 41+0 weeks of gestation; induction of labor at this gestational age reduces the risks associated with postterm pregnancy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postterm-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postterm pregnancy&quot;</a>). This relatively noninterventional approach is based on the favorable outcomes reported in a classic uncontrolled case series of 196 women with Class A diabetes managed this way [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Although clinical practice varies from institution to institution, there is generally consensus that these patients should not be electively delivered prior to 39 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. However, subsequent management is less clear; delaying intervention until after 40 weeks may increase the risk of cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. &#160;</p><p>While a decision analysis found that fetal and neonatal mortality may be minimized by delivery at 38 weeks of gestation, this mathematical model alone is insufficient for changing our clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. ACOG has opined that delivery should not be planned before 39 weeks of gestation unless otherwise indicated, and that expectant management up to 40+6 weeks is generally appropriate with antepartum testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1185133236\"><span class=\"h3\">A2 GDM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with GDM whose glucose levels are medically managed with insulin or oral agents (A2 GDM), we recommend induction of labor at 39 weeks of gestation based on data from a retrospective cohort study of women with GDM indicating that the infant mortality rate at 39 weeks (8.<span class=\"nowrap\">7/10,000)</span> was statistically lower than the risk of stillbirth plus infant mortality with expectant management over an additional week (15.<span class=\"nowrap\">2/10,000)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In addition, induction may reduce the risk of shoulder dystocia compared to later delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Early term delivery (37 or 38 weeks) is not indicated in uncomplicated A2 GDM with well-controlled glucose levels as the risk of stillbirth is low while neonatal morbidity rates are increased at this gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]; however, if a concomitant medical condition (eg, hypertension) is present or glycemic control is suboptimal, delivery should be undertaken as clinically indicated prior to 39 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Fetal weight also needs to be considered. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Scheduled cesarean delivery'</a> below.)</p><p>ACOG suggests delivery at 39+0 to 39+6 weeks of gestation for women with GDM well controlled with medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, guidance for women with poor glycemic control is less precise. They suggest that delivery at 37+0 to 38+6 weeks of gestation may be reasonable, but that delivery prior to 37+0 weeks should only be done when more aggressive efforts to control blood sugars, such as hospitalization, have failed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Scheduled cesarean delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scheduled cesarean delivery to avoid birth trauma is typically offered to women with GDM and estimated fetal weight &ge;4500 grams. The fetal weight threshold at which scheduled cesarean delivery should be performed to reduce the risk of birth trauma from shoulder dystocia is controversial. It has been estimated that in diabetic pregnancies with an estimated fetal weight of &ge;4500 grams, 443 cesareans would need to be performed to prevent one permanent brachial plexus injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Whether this trade-off justifies the increased risks of cesarean delivery is unclear. The ACOG practice bulletin on GDM recommends discussing the risks and benefits of scheduled cesarean delivery with women with GDM and estimated fetal weight &ge;4500 grams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p>When counseling patients, key issues to address include: (1) the difficulty in accurately predicting birthweight by any method, (2) the risks of a cesarean delivery in the current pregnancy, and (3) the risks of a prior cesarean delivery on management and outcome of future pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>].

If a woman with estimated fetal weight &ge;4500 grams decides to undergo a trial of labor, we follow labor progress closely and perform an operative vaginal delivery only if the fetal vertex has descended normally in the second stage of labor because instrumental delivery is associated with a higher risk of shoulder dystocia and brachial plexus injury, and the risk is even higher with the use of vacuum as compared with forceps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>].

The goal of treatment is to reduce the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. Although prolonged neonatal hypoglycemia is primarily due to fetal exposure to chronic hyperglycemia during pregnancy and resultant fetal pancreatic hyperplasia, transient hypoglycemia can be caused by intrapartum maternal hyperglycemia, which induces an acute rise in fetal insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/75-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-79</a>].</p><p>Insulin requirements usually decrease during labor, as the work of labor, particularly uterine contractions, requires energy and oral caloric intake is typically reduced. Women with GDM who were euglycemic without use of insulin or oral antihyperglycemic drugs during pregnancy do not normally require insulin during labor and delivery, and thus do not need their blood glucose levels checked hourly.</p><p>Women with GDM who used insulin or oral antihyperglycemic drugs to maintain euglycemia occasionally need insulin during labor and delivery to maintain euglycemia. There is no consensus about optimal glycemic control during labor and delivery. In one survey of academic medical centers, 60 percent of respondents reported their target intrapartum blood glucose level was &lt;110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (6.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and 30 percent reported a target between 110 and 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (6.1 and 8.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. The Endocrine Society suggests target glucose levels of 72 to 126 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.0 to 7.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. We generally check blood glucose measurements every two hours during labor and begin intravenous insulin at glucose levels above 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (6.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. We prefer this approach because mild hyperglycemia is generally less morbid and easier to treat than intrapartum hypoglycemia, which may occur when a long-acting insulin is administered subcutaneously.

After delivery, the hyperglycemic effects of placental hormones dissipate rapidly. Thus, most women revert back to their prepregnancy glycemic status almost immediately.</p><p>However, since some women with GDM may have previously unrecognized type 2 diabetes mellitus, we agree with Endocrine Society recommendations to check glucose concentrations for 24 to 72 hours after delivery to exclude ongoing hyperglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

Women who have fasting glucose levels below 126 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> after delivery should have a two-hour 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test 6 to 12 weeks postpartum to test for diabetes or prediabetes.

The optimal testing regimen has not been established from rigorous studies. We order twice weekly antenatal testing, using a nonstress test with an amniotic fluid index, starting at 32 weeks of gestation.

Potential benefits include lower rates of macrosomia and large for gestational age (LGA) infants, lower rates of shoulder dystocia, and lower rates of cesarean delivery. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Timing of delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with A1 GDM well-controlled with nutritional medical therapy alone, we suggest no antenatal fetal testing (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>) (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Antenatal fetal testing'</a> above). We offer the patient induction at 40+0 weeks of gestation. We recommend induction at 41+0<sup> </sup>of gestation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>).

Such women should be counseled about the poor predictive ability of ultrasound estimates of fetal weight and the risks and benefits of cesarean delivery in the current and future pregnancies. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Scheduled cesarean delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All women with GDM should have a two-hour, 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test between 6 and 12 weeks postpartum.
