As a result, optimal outcome for children with IEM depends upon recognition of the signs and symptoms of metabolic disease, prompt evaluation, and referral to a center familiar with the evaluation and management of these disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inborn-errors-of-metabolism-metabolic-emergencies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Delay in diagnosis may result in acute metabolic decompensation, progressive neurologic injury, or death.</p><p>This topic provides an overview of the presentation, initial evaluation, and management of children with suspected IEM who present with acute metabolic decompensation. Confirmation of diagnosis of specific disorders typically requires specialized testing and should be undertaken in consultation with a specialist in genetics or metabolic diseases. Determination of the specific IEM is reviewed separately. The classification and most common chronic presentations of IEM are also discussed separately, as are individual disorders.

Many of the disorders of intermediary metabolism can present with acute, life-threatening illness, particularly organic acidurias, urea cycle disorders, maple syrup urine disease, and fatty acid oxidation disorders. Neurotransmitter defects and related disorders can present with severe metabolic encephalopathy. In contrast, the disorders involving complex molecules tend to progress more slowly and do not typically cause acute metabolic decompensation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inborn-errors-of-metabolism-classification#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inborn errors of metabolism: Classification&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>.)</p><p>Metabolic crises occur when there is build-up of toxic metabolites. Triggers include factors that cause increased catabolism (acute infection; surgery, trauma, or even the birthing process; fasting) or increased consumption of a food component (eg, increased protein intake when switching from breast milk to cow's milk). Acute metabolic decompensation typically occurs after a period of apparent well-being. The duration of the symptom-free period may range from hours to months and sometimes years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inborn-errors-of-metabolism-identifying-the-specific-disorder#H12033749\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inborn errors of metabolism: Identifying the specific disorder&quot;, section on 'Clinical evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inborn-errors-of-metabolism-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features#H11382266\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inborn errors of metabolism: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Age at presentation'</a>.)</p><p>As an example, episodic metabolic decompensation with poor intake or fasting may be a feature of carbohydrate disorders, fatty acid oxidation disorders, and certain amino acid disorders. In many cases, the severity of decompensation may seem out of proportion to the precipitating condition (eg, mild gastroenteritis resulting in severe dehydration necessitating hospitalization for intravenous fluids or recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia in a school-aged child) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inborn-errors-of-metabolism-metabolic-emergencies/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Acute metabolic decompensation requires prompt recognition and intervention to prevent mortality and long-term morbidity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16728975\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An acute presentation with multisystem involvement is strongly suggestive of an IEM.

FTT can range from severe to mild, depending upon the specific disorder and the severity of the defect.

Depending upon the disorder, patients may be entirely neurologically normal prior to an acute metabolic decompensation or may have a longstanding history of developmental delay.</p><p>Cerebral edema can develop in certain IEM, particularly maple syrup urine disease and disorders associated with significant hyperammonemia and severe hypoglycemia.

Hyperammonemia stimulates the respiratory center, causing hyperpnea that then results in a respiratory alkalosis in urea cycle disorders. In organic acidemias, the metabolic acidosis caused by the IEM leads to tachypnea (as seen in nonmetabolic causes of acidosis). As the metabolic derangement progresses, there may be significant global neurologic depression leading to apnea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3681503\"><span class=\"h2\">Seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although IEM are a rare cause of seizures in children, seizures may occur in virtually all IEM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inborn-errors-of-metabolism-metabolic-emergencies/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. These seizures are typically related to the metabolic derangement but are not a generalized seizure disorder. Seizures may be the only manifestation of pyridoxine-dependent seizures that are due to alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde (alpha-AASA) dehydrogenase deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inborn-errors-of-metabolism-metabolic-emergencies/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. Seizures in other IEM are usually secondary to hypoglycemia or the accumulation of toxic metabolites in disorders of intermediary metabolism. Such seizures may respond poorly to standard anticonvulsant medications, responding instead to resolution of the primary metabolic derangement.
