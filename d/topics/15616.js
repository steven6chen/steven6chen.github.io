Although patients may appear very ill and uncomfortable during the acute febrile stage, the disease is self-limited, and prognosis is excellent once the responsible drug is stopped.</p><p>This topic review will discuss serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions (SSLRs), with an emphasis upon the biology and clinical features of serum sickness. A detailed discussion of hypersensitivity vasculitis, which has features similar to serum sickness, is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous small vessel vasculitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypersensitivity-vasculitis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypersensitivity vasculitis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3332911\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;serum sickness&quot; was introduced by von Pirquet and Schick, who published a book with that title (Die Serumkrankheit) in 1905 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The authors described an illness that developed in some patients after administration of horse serum that had been given as an anti-toxin for the treatment of diphtheria and scarlet fever. They noted that there was a delay between administration of the horse serum and the development of the symptoms of serum sickness, and the delay was shorter if horse serum was administered again at a later time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1264497533\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic clinical syndrome of serum sickness is caused by immunization of the host (human) by heterologous (nonhuman) serum proteins and subsequent illness caused by formation of immune complexes. However, the term &quot;serum sickness&quot; has also been applied to a variety of different but related syndromes of rash, arthritis, and fever beginning several days to weeks following administration of other types of drugs or in association with some infections. In this topic, we will refer to these related syndromes as &quot;serum sickness-like reactions&quot; and reserve &quot;serum sickness&quot; for the syndrome caused by immune reaction to a heterologous or chimeric protein therapeutic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum sickness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum sickness is the prototypic example of the Gell and Coombs &quot;type III&quot; or immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80466\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80466 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The reaction requires the presence of the antigen, coincident with antibodies directed against the antigen, leading to the formation of antigen-antibody or immune complexes. These should normally be cleared by the mononuclear phagocyte system, although if this system is not functioning well or is saturated by the immune complex load, then excess immune complexes may form in the circulation and deposit in tissues or form directly in the involved tissues. Immune complexes may deposit preferentially in joints because the synovial endothelium is fenestrated (with more permeable pores or slits) and thus is more accessible to proteins and protein complexes, although the reason that immune complexes target specific tissues is not well-understood. Once deposited, the presence of immune complexes in parenchymal tissues triggers an inflammatory response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3344798542\"><span class=\"h3\">Immune complex formation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following primary immunization with a protein antigen, immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies typically begin to develop 7 to 14 days later, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies appear a few days after IgM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. If the foreign protein is still present in the circulation when these antibodies appear, the antigen and antibodies may combine to form immune complexes. The traditional teaching about serum sickness implicated IgG as the predominant immunoglobulin in immune complex formation, although all immunoglobulin classes may be involved. The timing of the development of serum sickness suggests involvement of IgM-containing immune complexes after initial exposure to an antigen. Biopsies of lesional skin in patients with serum sickness from equine anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) demonstrated IgM, immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin E (IgE), although not IgG, supporting the role of immune complexes containing immunoglobulin classes other than IgG in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>The ratio of antigen to antibody is critical to the type of immune complex formed. The Heidelberger precipitin curve for the formation of antigen-antibody complexes demonstrates that intermediate-sized or large immune complexes (eg, Ag5Ab5) form in the zone of equivalence, when the ratio of antibody to antigen is optimal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F68456\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68456 \">figure 1</a>). These complexes deposit in tissues and are able to activate complement and recruit inflammatory cells more efficiently than small immune complexes. Small immune complexes form under conditions of either excess antigen (Ag) or excess antibody (Ab) (eg, Ag1Ab1, Ag2Ab1, or Ag1Ab2). These small complexes are inefficient at activating complement or binding to low-affinity Fc receptors and cause minimal or no damage if deposited in the tissues.</p><p>Complement activation leads to the formation of complement fragments, including C3a, a potent &quot;anaphylatoxin&quot; that causes mast cell degranulation, histamine release, and the development of urticarial lesions. The complement fragment C5a is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-pathways\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement pathways&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Complement activation also facilitates clearance of the immune complexes by coating soluble immune complexes with complement fragments. The complement-coated immune complexes then bind to erythrocytes, which express the receptor for fragments of C3 (complement component 3), on their surfaces. Erythrocyte-bound immune complexes are subsequently cleared by the mononuclear phagocyte system (primarily in the spleen and Kupffer cells of the liver). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulators and receptors of the complement system&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Soluble immune complexes, both with and without complement fragments, are also cleared from the circulation by binding to receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (Fc-gamma-R) on cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system. Serum sickness resolves when there is antibody excess or when the antigen is entirely removed from the serum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1909104467\"><span class=\"h3\">Complement-independent mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subsequent studies suggested that complement-independent mechanisms were also involved in the pathophysiology of serum sickness. Studies of experimental serum sickness and other immune complex diseases have been performed in mice that were genetically manipulated to disable the complement system <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> remove cellular receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (Fc-gamma-R) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. These studies revealed that in mice, a functioning complement system is not necessary to generate serum sickness, although intact Fc-gamma-receptors are. Immune complexes in tissues can react directly with Fc-gamma-receptors on neutrophils, mast cells, and phagocytes, leading to release of cytokines, histamine, and other inflammatory mediators and formation of characteristic pathologic lesions, even in the absence of complement. Additional studies have shown that immune complexes acting via the related Fc-gamma-receptor, Fc-gamma-RII, can have an inhibitory and immunomodulatory function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum sickness-like reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reactions to a variety of drugs (especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefaclor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefaclor</a> and anti-seizure medications) can clinically resemble classic serum sickness but are believed to be caused by different mechanisms. These are called serum sickness-like reactions (SSLRs).</p><p>SSLRs also occur following infections (especially streptococcal and some viral infections, such as hepatitis B) and some vaccines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The pathogenesis is not well-understood, although it may <strong>not</strong> depend upon high titers of antibodies and circulating immune complexes, as in classic serum sickness.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefaclor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cefaclor</a> &ndash; The antibiotic, cefaclor, can cause an SSLR with fever, rash, arthralgias, and possibly other symptoms, typically beginning one to three weeks after initial administration. One study demonstrated that metabolites of cefaclor produced in vitro were found to be toxic for lymphocytes and that the predisposing drug metabolism has a familial distribution and is thus presumptively genetically influenced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This type of reaction in which drug metabolites may have a direct toxic effect on cells and lead to idiosyncratic, delayed drug reactions has been described for other medications, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Increased intestinal permeability may contribute to the pathogenesis of SSLRs due to cefaclor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It has been suggested that the term &quot;serum sickness-like disease&quot; should be replaced by &quot;urticaria with arthritis&quot; to describe this drug-induced syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], although this terminology has not become common. Other terms proposed include &quot;benign iatrogenic vasculitis&quot; and &quot;urticaria-arthralgia syndrome&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

This may be caused by drug-specific immune complexes, rather than complexes containing heterologous serum proteins. Small drug molecules or their reactive metabolites may serve as haptens that bind covalently to serum proteins, such as albumin, and result in an antibody response either to the hapten or the hapten-protein conjugate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Note that the same patients may develop immediate hypersensitivity, which could be mediated by IgE or IgG, and present with acute urticaria or an <span class=\"nowrap\">anaphylactic/anaphylactoid</span> reaction, as well as a later SSLR.

As an example, acute hepatitis B infection may present with serum sickness-like features of rash, polyarthritis, and fever in the preicteric phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum sickness is more common in adults, while SSLRs are more common in children.

In the United States, use of heterologous anti-toxins is relatively infrequent, although still central to the treatment of snakebite or rabies exposure. A meta-analysis reported that serum sickness occurs in 13 percent of patients receiving the sheep hyperimmune Fab anti-venom used in the United States after pit viper snakebites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

This observation was made in the original description by von Pirquet, who noted that serum sickness developed in over 80 percent of patients receiving doses greater than 100 mL of anti-serum, while only 10 to 15 percent of patients receiving less than 20 mL of anti-serum were afflicted. Similarly, higher doses of equine botulinum anti-toxin and anti-snake venom were found to be more likely than lower doses to lead to serum sickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. The influence of dose was not found in another study of serum sickness due to snakebite anti-venom serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Some patients, for example, exposed to small amounts of bovine serum albumin administered during embryo transfer in the process of in vitro fertilization have been found to develop a serum sickness reaction to the bovine serum used for in vitro culture of the ova [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Similarly, it has been postulated that some of the reactions to human diploid cell <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabies vaccine</a> may arise from reactions to the fetal bovine serum used to grow the cells in tissue culture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F51122\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51122 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dosing schedule</strong> &ndash; Serum sickness can develop after a patient's initial exposure to a drug or after subsequent exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Intermittent exposure to a heterologous protein is associated with higher rates of SSLRs compared with continuous exposure, as illustrated by the following reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/24,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,49</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Twenty-five percent (10 of 40) of patients reinfused with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> following a long dosing hiatus developed a severe delayed reaction requiring glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

In patients who have been previously exposed to the causative drug, the syndrome starts earlier (ie, within one to seven days of receiving the inciting agent), and the illness has a more severe and &quot;explosive&quot; onset. If the patient still has immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies resulting from a previous exposure when that drug or serum is given again, an immediate reaction (such as an acute anaphylactoid reaction) may occur, giving rise to a mixed clinical picture that has features of both anaphylaxis and serum sickness. In theory, this could result from activation of mast cells or leukocytes by complement split products (ie, the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a) via IgG immune complexes or direct mast cell activation via IgE cross-linking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-pathways\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement pathways&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Serum sickness resolves when the causative agent is removed from the system. Typically, fever resolves within a few days of removal of the responsible agent, followed by resolution of rheumatic symptoms. Previous skin lesions may linger for longer periods. Symptoms typically resolve within two weeks of removal of the offending agent, although in unusual cases, symptoms can persist for as long as two to three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The course of illness may be protracted if the culprit agent has been administered as a depot or sustained release form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1309050861\"><span class=\"h2\">Fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Virtually all patients diagnosed with serum sickness develop fever, which is usually &gt;38.5&deg;C (&gt;101.3&deg;F). The fever of serum sickness is characterized by high spikes that return to normal within the same day. Rigors are unusual. The fever is remittent but has no predictable temporal pattern. Malaise preceding and during the fever is common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Dermatologic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cutaneous manifestations of serum sickness are variable. Almost all patients diagnosed with serum sickness develop a pruritic rash, which is often the earliest clinical feature. The dermatitis generally lasts a few days to two weeks after the causative agent is stopped. The mucous membranes are not involved, which can be a useful feature in distinguishing serum sickness from clinically similar conditions, especially Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). There may be urticarial lesions, which are typically longer-lasting than hives from other causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F52352\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52352 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F91345\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91345 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F91346\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91346 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F91344\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91344 \">picture 4</a>). Individual lesions may last days to weeks.</p><p>The rash often starts in the region around the injection site if a drug was administered locally by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection (as was typical for equine diphtheria anti-toxin described by von Pirquet). This was first described in patients receiving horse anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) administered as part of an immunosuppressive regimen used to treat aplastic anemia and other forms of bone marrow failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>]. It may also start in the anterior lower trunk, groin, periumbilical, or axillary regions and spread to involve the back, upper trunk, and extremities. Skin changes may be prominent at the lateral aspect of the feet and hands, at the junction of the sole and side of the foot, or the border between the palm and dorsal skin of the fingers and hands (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78783\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78783 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F61556\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61556 \">picture 6</a>).</p><p>Other skin manifestations may include palpable purpura, morbilliform eruptions, papules, or maculopapular lesions. Palmar erythema, livedo reticularis, and periungual hemorrhages have also been described. Frank vasculitis is uncommon. Ulcers, secondary infection, or scarring do not occur.

The joints commonly involved include the metacarpophalangeal joints, knees, wrists, ankles, and shoulders, although pain in the spine is also described. Pain in the jaw and temporomandibular joints is reported, particularly with serum sickness caused by ATG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/20,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,56</a>]. Myalgias in the arms and thighs may also occur.</p><p>While tenderness to palpation and movement are common and may be severe, swelling and erythema due to arthritis occur in only a minority of patients.

These eruptions are frequently initially mistaken for acute urticaria, but in contrast to acute urticaria, individual lesions remain for greater than 24 hours. The skin lesions typically gradually expand, leaving central clearing or central faint purpura, which are usually most evident on the abdomen or lower legs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F78466%7EDERM%2F78100%7EDERM%2F54053\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78466 graphicRef78100 graphicRef54053 \">picture 7A-C</a>).</p><p>Other signs include erythema and edema of the hands and feet, although this is not common.

Mild thrombocytopenia may occur. Eosinophilia may be present but is not prominent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein</strong> &ndash; These acute-phase reactants are elevated during active serum sickness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urinalysis</strong> &ndash; During serum sickness, urinalysis demonstrates mild proteinuria in about one-half of patients. Those with proteinuria may also develop transient mild hematuria without cellular casts. In contrast, urinalysis is usually normal in SSLRs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Serum chemistries, including blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and liver function tests</strong> &ndash; Occasionally in serum sickness, the serum creatinine is elevated up to about twice the baseline value, but renal dysfunction tends to resolve within a few days. Overt glomerulonephritis is rare. Hypoalbuminemia may be present in patients with edema. In contrast, renal and other systemic organ involvement is unusual in SSLRs due to medications.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1426183\"><span class=\"h2\">Testing to exclude infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important early goal of the evaluation is the exclusion of infectious causes, such as hepatitis B. Testing for specific infectious diseases should be performed if indicated by the history or physical examination or if a patient has an unusually long disease course that persists after stopping the medication suspected of causing serum sickness. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H153504845\"><span class=\"h2\">Other laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other tests, such as complement studies and skin biopsy, are sometimes performed in patients suspected of having serum sickness or SSLRs, although these are not recommended as part of the routine evaluation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complement studies, including CH50, C3, and C4</strong> &ndash; During severe episodes, complement measurements, including C3, C4, and total hemolytic complement (CH50), are depressed, reflecting complement consumption. Measures of circulating immune complexes, including the fluid-phase C1q-binding test and the Raji cell assay, are typically elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/5,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,19</a>]. The changes in complement and immune complex levels do not closely parallel the clinical course of serum sickness, and these tests are not routinely recommended as part of the laboratory evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and clinical assessment of the complement system&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skin biopsy</strong> &ndash; Skin biopsies are not usually necessary or helpful in confirming the diagnosis, since the findings are variable and not specific for serum sickness. In most cases, findings are similar to those seen in patients with urticaria:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mild perivascular infiltrates consisting of lymphocytes and histiocytes, in the absence of vessel necrosis, were the most typical findings in skin biopsies of patients who developed serum sickness from equine anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated immunoglobulin M (IgM) and C3, although no immunoglobulin G (IgG). It is possible that patients receiving ATG are not representative of all patients with serum sickness, because they are immunosuppressed by both ATG and glucocorticoids and often are neutropenic because of their underlying hematologic problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Leukocytoclastic vasculitis with neutrophilic involvement and fibrinoid necrosis has been reported in a minority of patients with serum sickness. Immunohistochemical or immunofluorescence staining with specific antibodies may reveal the presence of IgG and C3 within the walls of small arterioles and capillaries.

Laboratory findings should be consistent with the diagnosis.</p><p>The diagnosis of SSLRs is made in the same manner. Identification of the offending agent can be difficult if patients are on multiple medications that can be associated with SSLRs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of serum sickness and SSLRs includes viral illnesses with exanthems, hypersensitivity vasculitis, acute rheumatic fever, acute meningococcal or gonococcal infection, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (formerly called Still's disease), and other types of drug reactions. In children, Kawasaki disease and acute annular urticaria are additional possibilities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">In patients of any age</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Viral exanthematous infections</strong> &ndash; Viral infections can cause fever, rash, malaise, myalgias, and arthralgias, although joint complaints are usually not as prominent as in serum sickness. Viral infections that cause exanthems or urticaria can be particularly difficult to differentiate from serum sickness. The presence of mucosal lesions or pharyngeal lesions, which may be seen with viral infections, is atypical of serum sickness. Increasing transaminases suggest the possibility of preicteric hepatitis B infection, which can be confirmed by specific tests for hepatitis B virus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The emerging viral disease, chikungunya may be confused with serum sickness. Typically, the pain associated with the arthritis of chikungunya is more severe and disabling than the arthralgias in serum sickness, and headache is typical in chikungunya but not common in serum sickness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chikungunya-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chikungunya fever&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Dengue fever also may present with fever, arthralgia, and rash, but the cutaneous finding are more hemorrhagic and petechial than in serum sickness, and myalgias are more prominent than arthralgias. Zika virus infection may present with fever, rash, and arthralgias, but conjunctivitis is more likely in Zika infection. Travelers or residents of areas with these disorders should have appropriate serologic or nucleic acid-based testing to rule out these infections.

A number of drugs (eg, penicillins) can cause both SSLRs and hypersensitivity vasculitis. Most patients with serum sickness do not develop frankly vasculitic rashes. Arthralgias and arthritis are typically more prominent in serum sickness than in primary vasculitis, although they may be present in both.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Urticarial vasculitis can be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus or can be a primary disorder, often associated with hypocomplementemia and autoantibodies to the complement component C1q as part of the hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome.

Cardiac murmurs, carditis, and elevated serologic tests consistent with a recent streptococcal infection also suggest acute rheumatic fever.

In scarlet fever, the rash occurs along with the acute streptococcal infection on the second or third day of illness, whereas the onset of the rash and fever of serum sickness occurs at least several days after exposure to the inciting drug.

The typical monoarthritis of the knee seen in Lyme disease is not typical of serum sickness. A history of tick exposure would suggest the diagnosis of Lyme disease.

The skin findings of patients with these conditions often include cutaneous pustules or purpuric lesions containing the organism, whereas pustules are not seen in serum sickness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52107\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52107 \">picture 10</a>). Patients with disseminated gonococcal infection can have a localized septic arthritis with swelling atypical of serum sickness but can also have polyarthritis with painful periarticular swelling that can be confused with the findings of serum sickness.

Mucosal involvement (urethritis, stomatitis) and eye inflammation are common in reactive arthritis and not in serum sickness. The skin lesions associated with reactive arthritis, such as circinate balanitis, are distinct from the typical skin findings of serum sickness. Joint swelling and the development of chronic or recurrent arthritis are prominent in reactive arthritis, although not in serum sickness.

The typical urticarial rash of serum sickness is not seen in DRESS. A morbilliform rash present in the early phases of DRESS may be similar to the morbilliform pattern sometimes seen in serum sickness, but the rash of DRESS usually becomes confluent and very red and results in sloughing and peeling that are not seen in serum sickness. Arthralgias, typical of serum sickness, are not seen in DRESS. The prominent eosinophilia and elevated transaminases that are characteristic of DRESS are not seen in serum sickness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-reaction-with-eosinophilia-and-systemic-symptoms-dress\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other drug reactions</strong> &ndash; Other drug reactions that may mimic serum sickness or SSLRs include nonspecific exanthems, urticaria, and generalized hypersensitivity reactions. The development of an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated drug allergy can cause the onset of urticaria during a course of therapy. The concomitant presence of other allergic symptoms (such as throat tightness, wheezing, or acute anaphylaxis) may help elucidate the underlying process. If the culprit drug was penicillin or another beta-lactam drug, then skin testing for IgE-mediated drug allergy may be possible after the reaction has resolved.

None of these are typical of serum sickness. White blood cell counts and liver enzymes may be elevated in erythema multiforme but are not in serum sickness or SSLRs. Arthralgias are generally not prominent in erythema multiforme.

In the earliest stages, these reactions could be confused with SSLRs, although the later lesions of these severe reactions are distinct, and the mucous membranes are not involved in serum sickness or SSLRs. Prompt discontinuation of possible culprit drugs is the most important immediate intervention in SJS and TEN.

The rash of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis is classically evanescent, appearing during the febrile phase of the circadian variations in body temperature associated with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and then fading within a few hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62959\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62959 \">picture 13</a>). In contrast, the rash of serum sickness is morphologically different and is usually more persistent. Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis is likely to continue or recur without treatment, whereas serum sickness resolves within a few weeks of discontinuing the offending agent. The extreme elevations in serum ferritin that are characteristic of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis are not seen in serum sickness.

The skin lesions of Sweet syndrome are painful or associated with a burning sensation and are vesicular, nodular, or plaque-like, which are all features that differ from the usual pruritic rash of serum sickness. The drugs that trigger Sweet syndrome in some cases are not those typically responsible for serum sickness or SSLRs. Skin biopsies, often used to diagnosis Sweet syndrome, demonstrate prominent neutrophilic infiltrate that differs from findings typically seen in serum sickness.

However, Kawasaki disease can involve peripheral extremity changes, including erythema of palms or soles or edema of hands or feet (during the acute phase) and periungual desquamation (during the convalescent phase), which are different from the polyarthritis and arthralgias of serum sickness. In addition, prominent mucosal disease in the mouth and conjunctiva are typical of Kawasaki disease and unusual in serum sickness.

Lesions appear on the face, trunk, and extremities as annular erythematous plaques with central clearing or dusky blue centers. Unlike SSLRs and erythema multiforme, the duration of individual lesions does not exceed 24 hours. Myalgias and arthralgias are absent. Pruritus is typically present. Other associated findings may include angioedema of the face or acral areas, dermatographism, and low-grade fever. Viral or bacterial infections, antibiotics, and vaccinations have been proposed as potential triggers. The disorder is treated with antihistamines and discontinuation of a triggering medication, if present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-annular-skin-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with annular skin lesions&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no evidence-based guidelines or controlled trials upon which to base therapy recommendations.

The utility of glucocorticoids in the treatment of serum sickness and SSLRs is based upon case reports and small observational series. These agents are usually administered orally (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/27,61,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,61,63</a>]. Sometimes even higher doses are used. Occasionally, patients who are very uncomfortable or who appear acutely ill may be treated with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> in the range of 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in one or two divided doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/48,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,83</a>]. Glucocorticoids can frequently be rapidly tapered, with the total duration of therapy less than one week.

However, favorable outcomes have been reported in humans in this situation. As an example, anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is used in the treatment of patients with aplastic anemia, and it is sometimes continued in the setting of serum sickness because the therapy is potentially curative.

Most reactive patients had a broad hypersensitivity syndrome, which included signs and symptoms of mast cell activation, in many cases associated with positive immunoglobulin E (IgE) skin testing, a type of reaction that should be amenable to desensitization. Whether other patients with isolated SSLRs to rituximab or other foreign proteins can be &quot;desensitized&quot; remains to be demonstrated.

This should be recorded in the patient's medical record, and the patient should be educated about the various names the culprit drug might have. If the drug is commonly encountered, the patient should obtain a medical identification bracelet or necklace. After an episode of serum sickness, re-exposure to the same drug may lead to a more rapid and more severe serum-sickness reaction. (See <a href=\"#H3377410934\" class=\"local\">'Temporal course'</a> above.)</p><p>If no alternative agents are available and retreating with a drug that previously caused serum sickness is absolutely required, treatment with antihistamines or glucocorticoids may help prevent future episodes of serum sickness upon re-exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H320556567\"><span class=\"h2\">Future use of related drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is some controversy about whether related drugs can be used safely in a patient with a past serum sickness or SSLR to a specific agent.

Serum sickness-like reactions (SSLRs) present as rash, arthritis, and fever beginning several days to weeks following administration of a drug. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classic serum sickness is a Gell and Coombs &quot;type III&quot; or immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80466\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80466 \">table 1</a>). Heterologous protein antigens combine with host immunoglobulins specifically reacting with those antigens. If the resultant immune complexes are not adequately cleared by the mononuclear phagocyte system, excess immune complexes form in (or are deposited in) tissues and trigger an inflammatory response. In contrast, the pathophysiology of SSLRs is less well-characterized and may vary depending upon the culprit agent. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of heterologous &quot;foreign&quot; proteins can cause classic serum sickness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F51122\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51122 \">table 2</a>). Therapeutic murine monoclonal antibodies and chimeric antibodies, including equine anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, have been implicated. SSLRs are most commonly caused by antibiotics, such as penicillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefaclor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefaclor</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>, although a variety of medications have been associated with these reactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F73703\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73703 \">table 3</a>).

In patients who have been previously exposed to the agent, the syndrome starts earlier (ie, within one to seven days of receiving the inciting agent), and the illness has a more severe and &quot;explosive&quot; onset. The rash is a pruritic urticarial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> morbilliform eruption. The mucosal membranes are not involved. Laboratory findings are variable.
