There are many clinical prognostic factors that are immediately available to the physician based upon the initial history, physical examination, ECG, and chest radiograph. Given the speed with which reperfusion therapy is administered in patients with STEMI, their clinical utility in early medical decision-making in the emergency department is often limited. They do provide good prognostic information that has utility in the post-reperfusion period, however, and may provide guidance regarding the optimum method of reperfusion.</p><p>High-risk features include advanced age, low blood pressure, tachycardia, heart failure, and an anterior MI. Specific scoring systems, such as the TIMI risk score, permit a fairly precise determination of the risk of in-hospital mortality (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-thrombolysis-in-myocardial-infarction-timi-score-for-st-elevation-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-acute-management-of-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>Patients at high risk require an aggressive management strategy in addition to standard medical management.

Other routine hospital measures include anxiolytics, serial electrocardiograms, and blood pressure monitoring.

The GIK infusion was begun at the time of randomization. <br/><br/>At 30 days, there was no difference between the two groups in mortality (10 versus 9.7 percent with usual care), cardiac arrest (1.5 versus 1.4 percent), cardiogenic shock (6.3 versus 6.6 percent), or reinfarction (2.4 versus 2.3 percent). A potential limitation of this trial was the relatively late use of GIK: The median time from symptom onset to treatment was approximately six hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The IMMEDIATE trial randomly assigned 871 patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes (approximately 40 percent with ST-elevation on the presenting electrocardiogram) to intravenous GIK or identical-appearing 5 percent glucose placebo, which was administered by paramedics in the out-of-hospital setting and continued for 12 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-acute-management-of-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. There was no difference in the rate of progression to MI (as measured by biomarkers and ECG evidence) at 24 hours or the rate of death at 30 days among patients who received GIK compared to those who received placebo (48.7 versus 52.6 percent; odds ratio 0.88, 95% CI 0.66-1.13 and 4.4 versus 6.1 percent; odds ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.40-1.29, respectively). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">MI WITH NORMAL CORONARY ARTERIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the time of coronary angiography, as many as 7 percent of patients with acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (MI) do not have a critical coronary artery lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-acute-management-of-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], including approximately 3 percent who have normal epicardial coronary arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-acute-management-of-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>].
