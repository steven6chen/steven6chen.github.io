Because of its tendency to involve veins, the disorder has also been termed &quot;periphlebitis retinae&quot; and &quot;idiopathic retinal periphlebitis.&quot;</p><p>The clinical presentation, treatment, and prognosis of Eales' disease are distinct from those of other inflammatory conditions that involve the retina. Eales' disease must be distinguished from systemic disorders and infections as well as from other ocular syndromes that cause retinal vasculitis.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of Eales' disease will be reviewed. Retinal vasculitis that occurs in association with systemic disorders, infections, and primary retinal diseases is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinal vasculitis associated with systemic disorders and infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-primary-ocular-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinal vasculitis associated with primary ocular disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eales' disease was described originally in England [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eales-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>] but is observed much more commonly on the Indian subcontinent than in any other region. Eales' disease has been estimated to occur in 1 of every 135 to 250 patients evaluated at tertiary eye care centers in India [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eales-disease/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>A striking male predominance is reported in most series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eales-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, in one series from North America, equal numbers of females and males were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eales-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The mean age at onset in most studies from India is between the age of 20 and 30 years, compared with approximately 40 years in America and Germany [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eales-disease/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of Eales' disease remains undefined. Substantial speculation has surrounded the potential association between <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> (TB) and Eales' disease. If any true association does exist between these entities, the relationship is likely to be a reactive type of inflammation, similar to that which occurs in the joints in Poncet's disease (tuberculous rheumatism) or HLA-B27-associated reactive arthritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skeletal-tuberculosis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skeletal tuberculosis&quot;, section on 'Inflammatory (Poncet's disease)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactive arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Data providing indirect support for the possibility of reactive inflammation include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Five of 12 vitrectomy samples from patients with Eales' disease who underwent this procedure to treat vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment had <em>M. tuberculosis</em> DNA detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eales-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a second study, evidence of the <em>M. tuberculosis</em> genome was detected by a nested PCR technique in 11 of 23 epiretinal membranes removed from the eyes of patients with Eales' disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eales-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, cultures of the vitreous specimens were negative in all cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a third study, 19 vitrectomy samples from patients with Eales' disease had higher intraocular levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha compared with control subjects, further supporting the plausible theory of inflammation-mediated angiogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eales-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study from India assessed serum samples from 45 patients with Eales' disease and found elevated levels of interleukin-1 beta and TNF-alpha compared with healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eales-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p>In summary, data suggest that some patients with Eales' disease harbor nonviable TB organisms. Additional investigations of the role of TB as a potential etiologic agent in Eales' disease are required.</p><p>The precise events in the pathophysiology of Eales' disease remain incompletely defined. Light microscopic and immunohistochemical studies of the epiretinal and subretinal membranes in Eales' disease reveal T cell infiltration. In other ocular inflammatory diseases, the blood-retinal barrier breaks down during intraocular inflammation, followed by seepage of circulating blood into the retina. The vascular tropism of Eales' disease, its predilection for veins, and its confinement to the retina remain unexplained. The presence of inflammatory mediators and vascular growth factors in the vitreous of these patients supports the theory of inflammation-mediated angiogenesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of Eales' disease are caused by three basic pathophysiologic processes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammation (peripheral retinal perivasculitis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemia changes (peripheral retinal capillary nonperfusion)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neovascularization</p><p/><p>Eales' disease begins as a retinal perivasculitis that primarily affects the peripheral parts of the retina. Involvement of all four quadrants of the peripheral retina by active perivasculitis and exudates surrounding retinal veins is not unusual. Branch retinal vein occlusion may be noted on initial examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eales-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Central portions of the retina may also be involved at the time of diagnosis. Up to 90 percent of patients with Eales' disease eventually have involvement of both eyes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eales-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Because of the peripheral retinal focus of Eales' disease, patients are usually asymptomatic in the initial stages and present in a subacute manner. Some patients complain of seeing floating spots in one or both eyes. Mild visual blurring can occur early in the disease course, but profound visual loss may develop later because of vitreous hemorrhage. The visual loss in Eales' disease is painless. The duration of symptom progression can be quite variable, ranging from weeks to months.</p><p>Eales' disease may evolve in a discontinuous fashion, with apparent regression of the inflammatory process in some areas of the retina associated with signs of healing. Healed perivasculitis is represented by venous sheathing.</p><p>Superficial retinal hemorrhages often accompany the inflammation. Vitreous hemorrhage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F50653\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50653 \">picture 1</a>) occasionally results from capillary rupture caused by vascular inflammation in the acute phases of the illness, but more commonly stems from proliferative retinal disease that resembles diabetic retinopathy.</p><p>Peripheral retinal neovascularization in Eales' disease has a characteristic &quot;sea fan&quot; appearance. Recurrent vitreous hemorrhage from these lesions is a disease hallmark. Although vitreous hemorrhages may resolve spontaneously over a period of weeks, the more common scenario is that such hemorrhages lead to organization, multiple vitreoretinal adhesions, and retinal detachment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical stages</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Four clinical stages have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eales-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although there is substantial overlap of these stages within a given patient, these stages emphasize the characteristic findings of the disease in evolution.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage I &ndash; Mild periphlebitis of small peripheral retinal capillaries, arterioles, and venules.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 2 &ndash; Widespread perivasculitis of the venous capillary system, affecting even larger veins and the arterioles adjacent to affected veins. Vitreous haze is present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 3 &ndash; New vessel formation with abundant hemorrhage in the retina and vitreous.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 4 &ndash; Massive, recurrent vitreous hemorrhages, with retinitis proliferans and traction retinal detachment.</p><p/><p>The initial stages may be asymptomatic but patients can complain about floaters, photopsias, and blurry vision with progressive disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of Eales' disease is based upon the presence of characteristic clinical findings (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above) and the exclusion of systemic disorders that may result in similar findings, such as sarcoidosis, which can exhibit similar ocular manifestations to early-stage Eales' disease. Both laboratory tests and imaging studies are helpful in the exclusion of other diseases and in the evaluation of disease severity in Eales' disease. Because of the potentially devastating impact of visual loss from retinal inflammation, all of the evaluation below should be completed in order to ensure that the correct diagnosis has been made. Prompt referral and evaluation by an ophthalmologist is necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend a complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, urinalysis with microscopy, and specific serologic tests in all patients with retinal vasculitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Serologic assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following serologic tests should also be performed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antinuclear antibodies &ndash; Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is useful for the exclusion of connective tissue diseases related to systemic lupus erythematosus. A strongly positive ANA assay should be followed by additional serological testing to determine the specific disease state responsible for the ANA positivity. This additional testing may include serum complement levels (C3, C4), antibodies to double-stranded DNA, and antibodies to the Ro, La, Sm, or RNP antigens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-and-clinical-significance-of-antinuclear-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement and clinical significance of antinuclear antibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiphospholipid antibodies &ndash; Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) may be associated with ocular thrombotic events that mimic Eales' disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;</a>). Because not all patients with the aPL syndrome have all types of aPL, performance of each of the following tests is important:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>IgG and IgM anti-beta2-glycoprotein I</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lupus anticoagulant assay (usually a Russell viper venom time)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rheumatoid factor &ndash; A positive rheumatoid factor assay is a nonspecific result, but extremely high titers are usually found in the setting of rheumatoid vasculitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatoid vasculitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Origin and utility of measurement of rheumatoid factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides &ndash; Antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides (anti-CCP antibodies) have a high specificity for rheumatoid arthritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biologic markers in the diagnosis and assessment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies &ndash; Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) assays are likely to be positive in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's), microscopic polyangiitis, or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss), particularly in cases associated with scleritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical spectrum of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If an immunofluorescence assay is positive in either a cytoplasmic or a perinuclear pattern (ie, C-ANCA or P-ANCA), then confirmation of the ANCA specificity is important, through enzyme immunoassays for antibodies to proteinase-3 and myeloperoxidase.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spirochetal disease assays &ndash; Syphilis should be excluded with an initial screening with a nontreponemal test (eg, a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] test), and then confirmed if reactive with a treponemal-specific test (eg, a fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption [FTA-ABS] test). Lyme disease should be excluded with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay followed, if appropriate, by a Western immunoblot assay. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Screening and diagnostic testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-lyme-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Serologic testing'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several imaging procedures are useful in the evaluation of Eales' disease:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Chest imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A chest x-ray or computed tomographic (CT) study of the lungs is important in the exclusion of several systemic diseases associated with retinal vasculitis, such as sarcoidosis and systemic vasculitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Fluorescein angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fundus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> angiography (FFA) is a sensitive, noninvasive approach to detecting retinal blood vessel abnormalities that are consistent with Eales' disease. FFA findings include aneurysms, hemorrhage, and vascular occlusions.</p><p>FFA is particularly helpful in the ischemic stage, when it can delineate areas of nonperfusion, neovascularization, and macular edema and can help guide the selection of sites for laser photocoagulation. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Laser photocoagulation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In eyes that have undergone vitreous hemorrhage, the detection of retinal detachments by slit-lamp examination is problematic. In such cases, ultrasonography is needed to exclude retinal detachments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539063124\"><span class=\"h3\">Ocular coherence tomogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ocular coherence tomogram (OCT) offers high-resolution imaging of the retina. OCT can demonstrate regions of neovascularization, hemorrhage, and macular edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eales' disease must be distinguished from retinal vasculitis found in primary vasculitides, connective tissue disorders, infections, and other conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinal vasculitis associated with systemic disorders and infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One distinguishing feature between Eales' disease and other disorders associated with retinal vasculitis is that anterior uveitis seldom occurs concomitantly with Eales' disease. In a small percentage of patients with Eales' disease, a &quot;spillover&quot; uveitis occurs. This reflects spillover of inflammatory cells from the vasculitis into the uveal tract.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of Eales' disease must be individualized according to the patient's disease manifestations. There are four major treatment options: watchful waiting, medical therapy, laser photocoagulation, and vitreal surgery. There are also case reports of benefit from the use of intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents. The presence of retinal detachment generally signals the need for vitreal surgery. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Vitreous surgery'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Watchful waiting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Watchful waiting is appropriate for patients in whom the initial slit-lamp examination reveals only venous sheathing, a finding that is consistent with inactive vasculitis. In such patients, we suggest follow-up evaluations with slit-lamp examinations and FFA every six months. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p>Watchful waiting may also be appropriate in patients with fresh vitreous hemorrhage, which sometimes resolves spontaneously. Such patients should be evaluated monthly with history, ocular examination, slit-lamp examination, possibly FFA, and, if the fundus cannot be well-visualized, ultrasonography.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cornerstone of medical therapy for Eales' disease is glucocorticoids. Both periocular glucocorticoid injections and systemic glucocorticoids may be useful. Limited data suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> is an alternative to glucocorticoids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Systemic glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The limited evidence available suggests that systemic glucocorticoids are effective in idiopathic retinal vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eales-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Both extrapolation of the data from idiopathic retinal vasculitis and clinical experience with Eales' disease itself suggest that glucocorticoids have an important role in the inflammatory phase of Eales' disease.</p><p>The initial treatment approach when using systemic glucocorticoids in Eales' disease is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day for one month. Although there is no standard for glucocorticoid tapering, the following approach is useful in many systemic and ocular inflammatory diseases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prednisone</a> tapering should begin after one month at the initial dose.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dose is tapered by 10 mg each week until a dose of 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> is reached.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After one week on 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> the dose is tapered by 5 mg each week until the patient reaches 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After one week on 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> the dose is tapered by 2.5 mg each week until the patient reaches 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After one week on 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> the dose is tapered by 1 mg every two weeks until the patient reaches 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p/><p>Assuming that a patient begins <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> treatment at 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and remains on this dose for one month, the taper outlined above will require six months to reach a daily dose of 5 mg. If serial ocular examinations indicate that the retinal vasculitis is controlled, prednisone may be discontinued entirely by tapering in 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> decrements each week.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Periocular glucocorticoid injections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periocular glucocorticoid injections into the posterior sub-Tenon region are particularly helpful in the setting of cystoid macular edema and may be used in addition to systemic glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eales-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The dosing is typically 1 mL of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span>. For those with resistant cystoid macular edema, triamcinolone acetonide (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> can be injected intraocularly, typically 0.05 to 0.1 mL.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Methotrexate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients in whom the need to avoid systemic glucocorticoids is critical, limited evidence suggests that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> may also be useful in the setting of active Eales' disease. In a case series of 21 consecutive patients with Eales' disease, patients received 12.5 mg of methotrexate weekly for a total of 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eales-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The major results were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eighteen patients (86 percent) achieved excellent visual outcomes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eighty percent of the patients had treatment responses by four weeks.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients completed their treatment courses without serious side effects of therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Laser photocoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Photocoagulation is the cornerstone of therapy for treatment of the proliferative stage of Eales' disease. In comparison, laser photocoagulation is contraindicated during periods of active inflammation, when neovascularization may be worsened by the release of angiogenic factors.</p><p>The aims of photocoagulation in Eales' disease are threefold:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To divert blood from hypoxic areas to areas of healthy retina, thereby decreasing the stimulus for vasoproliferative factors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To destroy areas of surface neovascularization, thereby reducing the likelihood of vitreous hemorrhage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To seal leaks from microvascular abnormalities within the retina</p><p/><p>Evidence for the efficacy of laser photocoagulation in Eales' disease is extrapolated from excellent data demonstrating the efficacy of this intervention in the proliferative retinopathy of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eales-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. If applied properly, photocoagulation can help prevent the late complications of Eales' disease, including recurrent vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, anterior segment neovascularization, and secondary glaucoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Vitreous surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of vitrectomy is to remove vitreous opacities and to evaluate the fundus for retinal neovascularization. In some series, almost 20 percent of patients with Eales' disease eventually undergo vitrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eales-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Patients with vitreous hemorrhage and obscuration of central vision that has persisted for three months are candidates for vitrectomy. Visual outcomes may be better in patients who undergo vitrectomy between three and six months, compared with those in whom the procedure is deferred for more than six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eales-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Earlier vitrectomy may be considered if a traction retinal detachment occurs or if there is extensive membrane formation within the vitreous or over the macula.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539063139\"><span class=\"h3\">Intravitreal injections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravitreal injections of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide have been used to control the disease (often in combination with systemic corticosteroids).

Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections have been used in patients with diseases inducing retinal and choroidal neovascularization, such as age-related macular degeneration.
