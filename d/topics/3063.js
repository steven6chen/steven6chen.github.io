The dilutional fall in serum sodium is in most patients associated with a proportional reduction in the serum osmolality (ie, to a level below 275 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg),</span> but there are some exceptions. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Hyponatremia with a high or normal serum osmolality'</a> below.)</p><p>In virtually all patients, hyponatremia results from the intake (either oral or intravenous) and subsequent retention of water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. A water load will, in normal individuals, be rapidly excreted as the dilutional fall in serum osmolality suppresses the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also called vasopressin) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65195\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65195 \">figure 1</a>), thereby allowing excretion of the excess water in a dilute urine. The maximum attainable urine volume in normal individuals on a regular diet is over 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span>. This provides an enormous range of protection against the development of hyponatremia since the daily fluid intake in most healthy individuals is less than 2 to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span>.</p><p>In contrast to the response in normal individuals, patients who develop hyponatremia typically have an impairment in renal water excretion, most often due to an inability to suppress ADH secretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F101823\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101823 \">algorithm 1</a>). An uncommon exception occurs in patients with primary polydipsia who can become hyponatremic because they rapidly drink such large quantities of fluid that they overwhelm the excretory capacity of the kidney even though ADH release is appropriately suppressed.</p><p>An overview of the causes of hyponatremia will be presented here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F77603\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77603 \">table 1</a>). Most of the individual causes of hyponatremia are discussed in detail separately, as are issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>].

As a result, plasma tonicity is equal to the effective intracellular osmolality and to the effective osmolality of the total body water (TBW). These relationships can be summarized by the following equation:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Plasma tonicity &#160;= &#160;(Extracellular solute &#160;+ &#160;Intracellular solute)<br/> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br/> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; TBW </p></div></div><p>Exchangeable sodium salts (Nae) are the primary effective extracellular solute and exchangeable potassium (Ke) and its associated intracellular anions are the primary intracellular solutes; these solutes are the major determinants of the effective plasma osmolality. Glucose, the other major extracellular solute is, in the absence of marked hyperglycemia, present in a much lower molar concentration than sodium (eg, 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> [90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL]</span> versus 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p>Approximately 30 percent of total body sodium and a smaller fraction of total body potassium are bound in areas such as bone where they are &quot;nonexchangeable&quot; and therefore not osmotically active. In addition, urea is considered an ineffective osmole since it freely equilibrates across the cell membranes. When the plasma concentration of an ineffective osmole changes, the solute rapidly moves into or out of cells to equalize the concentrations. Thus, in contrast to water shift induced by&nbsp;changes in the plasma sodium concentration, changes in the plasma urea concentration result in little or no water shift into or out of cells.</p><p>Thus, plasma tonicity (effective plasma osmolality) can be expressed as:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Plasma tonicity &#160;&asymp; &#160; (2 x Nae &#160;+ &#160;2 x Ke)<br/> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br/> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;TBW </p></div></div><p>The multiplier 2 accounts for the osmotic contributions of the anions accompanying sodium and potassium.

These corrections in glucose and BUN do not need to be made when standard units are used.</p><p>The contributions of glucose and BUN to the serum osmolality are normally small, except in conditions such as diabetes mellitus and renal failure. Thus, the serum osmolality can be estimated in most patients by doubling the serum sodium concentration.

Symptomatic infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an example of this phenomenon, as volume depletion, the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion, and adrenal insufficiency all may be present.

Effective arterial blood volume depletion can occur by two mechanisms: true volume depletion; and edematous patients with heart failure or cirrhosis in whom tissue perfusion is reduced because of a low cardiac output or arterial vasodilation, respectively. The reduction in tissue perfusion is sensed by baroreceptors at three sites: in the carotid sinus and aortic arch that regulate sympathetic activity and, with significant volume depletion, the release of antidiuretic hormone; in the glomerular afferent arterioles that regulate the activity of the renin-angiotensin system; and in the atria and ventricles that regulate the release of natriuretic peptides.

This response is mediated by baroreceptors in the carotid sinus, which sense a reduction in pressure or stretch, and can overcome the inhibitory effect of hyponatremia on ADH secretion. Thus, water retention and hyponatremia can develop in patients with any disorder causing effective arterial blood volume depletion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">True volume depletion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>True volume depletion can be caused by the loss of sodium and water from the gastrointestinal tract (eg, vomiting or diarrhea), in the urine (most often due to diuretic therapy), or bleeding. Such patients may also have hypokalemia and, if enough fluid is lost, azotemia due to decreased renal perfusion.</p><p>The replacement of severe diarrhea losses due to cholera (which is associated with a sodium concentration in stool of 120 to 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L)</span> with an oral rehydration solution with reduced osmolality (ie, more free water) may result in an increased incidence of hyponatremia as compared to replacement with standard oral rehydration therapy, which has a higher sodium concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

It typically begins soon after the onset of thiazide therapy. By contrast, hyponatremia is only rarely induced by loop diuretics since the inhibition of sodium chloride transport in the loop of Henle prevents the generation of the countercurrent gradient and therefore limits the ability of ADH to promote water retention. </p><p>The following discussion will briefly review the mechanisms involved in thiazide-induced hyponatremia. A more complete discussion is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diuretic-induced-hyponatremia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diuretic-induced hyponatremia&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Although hypovolemia can contribute to thiazide-induced hyponatremia, most patients appear clinically euvolemic and several other factors appear to play a role in the development of hyponatremia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An underlying tendency to increased water intake.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reduction in diluting ability and therefore impaired water excretion, which is a direct effect of reduced sodium chloride reabsorption without water in the distal tubule.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sodium plus potassium concentration in the urine may exceed that in the plasma, which will directly lower the plasma sodium concentration (see <a href=\"#H886104859\" class=\"local\">'Determinants of the serum sodium concentration'</a> above). As an example, in a study of five patients with recent onset of severe thiazide-induced hyponatremia (mean serum sodium 105 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L),</span> the urine sodium plus potassium concentration was 156 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Heart failure and cirrhosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even though the plasma and extracellular volumes may be markedly increased in heart failure and cirrhosis, the pressure sensed at the carotid sinus baroreceptors is generally reduced due to the fall in cardiac output in heart failure and to arterial vasodilatation in cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/3,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14</a>]. Thus, serum ADH levels tend to reflect the severity of the underlying disease, making the development of hyponatremia an important prognostic sign. A stable serum sodium below 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> is a marker of near end-stage liver or heart disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55554\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55554 \">figure 4</a>).

Most such patients have relatively normal tissue perfusion and effective arterial volume and therefore do not have a clinically important stimulus to ADH secretion.

Major causes include central nervous system disease, malignancy, certain drugs, and recent surgery.

However, hyponatremia with features that are identical to those found in patients meeting the classical definition of SIADH (ie, euvolemia with a high urine osmolality and urine sodium) can also occur in patients with hypothyroidism or secondary adrenal insufficiency (not primary adrenal insufficiency, in which hyponatremia is associated with hypovolemia). Because these endocrine disorders are not always clinically apparent when patients first present with unexplained hyponatremia, some authors include endocrine disorders in the differential diagnosis of SIADH. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88313973\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypothyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyponatremia is sometimes associated with moderate to severe hypothyroidism, particularly in patients with primary hypothyroidism and myxedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>]. Thus, thyroid function should be evaluated in any patient with an otherwise unexplained reduction in the plasma sodium concentration. However, because hypothyroidism and hyponatremia are common findings in hospitalized patients, their coexistence may not necessarily be causal; other explanations for hyponatremia should still be sought unless hypothyroidism is severe.</p><p>The mechanism by which hypothyroidism induces hyponatremia is incompletely understood. Patients with hypothyroidism have a diminished ability to excrete free water and fail to achieve maximally dilute urine after a water load. Some but not all studies have reported elevated levels of ADH in patients who have hyponatremia associated with hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. This may be due in part to a reduced cardiac output, which can lead to the release of ADH via the carotid sinus baroreceptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/18,19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,22</a>]. However, some patients fulfill criteria for SIADH since the urine sodium is not low as would be expected if a reduced cardiac output were responsible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The glomerular filtration rate is also decreased in hypothyroidism. This can directly diminish free water excretion by diminishing water delivery to the diluting segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

Regardless of the mechanism, the net effect of the impairment in water excretion is the retention of ingested water and a reduction in the plasma sodium concentration by dilution.</p><p>Some have questioned whether hypothyroidism deserves its traditional listing as a cause of hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. As an example, a study that compared 999 ambulatory patients with newly diagnosed hypothyroidism with 4875 euthyroid controls found no difference in serum sodium concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, none of the hypothyroid patients had a serum sodium concentration &lt;120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> while two controls had hyponatremia of this severity. Although there was a statistical correlation between higher TSH levels and lower serum sodium concentrations, the slope of the relationship was clinically negligible. By contrast, symptomatic hyponatremia (with serum sodium concentrations ranging from 121 to 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L)</span> was reported in five patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma after withdrawal of thyroid hormone replacement (withdrawn prior to administration of radioactive iodine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

In primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease), hypovolemia-induced ADH secretion resulting from aldosterone deficiency also contributes. Secondary adrenal insufficiency (hypopituitarism), presents with euvolemic hyponatremia with biochemical features of SIADH. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Although the water retention will also lower the serum osmolality, this will be offset at least in part by the elevation in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). As a result, the measured serum osmolality may be normal or even increased, a finding that can also be seen in some other disorders. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Hyponatremia with a high or normal serum osmolality'</a> below.)</p><p>However, there is a difference between the measured serum osmolality and the effective serum osmolality.

As an example, one study of 239 hospitalized patients with mental illness found that 6.6 percent had a history compatible with compulsive water drinking and that one-half of these had intermittent symptoms of hyponatremia due to transient water retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>It is presumed that a central defect in thirst regulation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of polydipsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/52,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,56</a>]. In some cases, for example, the osmotic threshold for thirst is reduced <strong>below</strong> the threshold for the release of ADH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In contrast to normal subjects in whom the thirst threshold is roughly equal to or a few <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> <strong>higher</strong> than the threshold for ADH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>], these patients will continue to drink until the plasma osmolality is less than the threshold level. This may be difficult to achieve, however, since ADH secretion will be suppressed by the fall in plasma osmolality, resulting in rapid excretion of the excess water and continued stimulation of thirst. The mechanism responsible for abnormal thirst regulation in patients with primary polydipsia is unclear. </p><p>Normal subjects can excrete more than 400 to 600 mL of urine per hour, a response that is mediated by suppression of ADH secretion and the subsequent formation of a dilute urine with a minimum osmolality between 40 and 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span>. If ADH regulation were intact, primary polydipsia should not lead to clinically important disturbances in the plasma sodium concentration unless intake were massively increased. Thus, the serum sodium concentration is usually normal or only slightly reduced in primary polydipsia since the excess water is readily excreted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. These patients may be asymptomatic or present with complaints of polydipsia and polyuria.

In normal subjects, the plasma water is approximately 93 percent of the plasma volume, with fats and proteins accounting for the remaining 7 percent. Thus, a normal plasma sodium concentration of 142 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> (measured per liter of plasma) actually represents a concentration in the physiologically important plasma water of 153 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> (142 &#160;&divide; &#160;0.93 &#160;= &#160;153).</p><p>However, the plasma water fraction may fall below 80 percent in patients with marked hyperlipidemia (as with lactescent serum in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus) or hyperproteinemia (as in multiple myeloma). In these settings, the plasma water sodium concentration and plasma osmolality are unchanged, but the measured sodium concentration in the total plasma volume will be reduced since the specimen contains less plasma water. This specific artifact is dependent upon the method used for electrolyte measurement. Thus, it is a prominent artifact when flame photometry or indirect potentiometry is utilized but does not occur when with direct potentiometry.

In virtually all patients, hyponatremia is due to the intake (either oral or intravenous) of water that cannot be excreted. This is usually accompanied by a proportional fall in serum osmolality (to a level below 275 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg)</span> but there are settings in the which the serum osmolality is high (greater than 295 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg)</span> or normal.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two major causes of hyponatremia with a low serum osmolality, both of which are associated with elevated serum ADH levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F101823\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101823 \">algorithm 1</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Effective arterial blood volume depletion'</a> above.)<br/><br/>Heart failure and cirrhosis cause hyponatremia despite increased plasma volume because the pressure sensed at the carotid sinus baroreceptors is reduced due to the fall in cardiac output in heart failure and to peripheral vasodilatation in cirrhosis. The rise in serum ADH levels varies with the severity of the disease, making the development of hyponatremia an important adverse prognostic sign.

In advanced renal failure, the associated elevation in blood urea nitrogen can counteract the fall in serum osmolality induced by hyponatremia.
