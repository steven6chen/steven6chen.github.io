Models using blood folate concentrations to estimate the optimal folic acid dose suggest that 163 micrograms may be inadequate and that 400 micrograms per day may be needed; however, epidemiologic data have demonstrated significant reductions in NTD rates in countries where food fortification is at the same level as the United States and folic acid supplementation is not widespread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folic-acid-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>].</p><p>The adequacy of current levels of food fortification is supported by a 2017 systematic review by&nbsp;the&nbsp;US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) that noted studies of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplementation performed after 1998, when food fortification with folic acid became routine in the United States, have not demonstrated a protective association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folic-acid-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], suggesting that current levels of food fortification&nbsp;may be&nbsp;sufficient to prevent most folate-sensitive NTDs.
