Creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and aldolase are the serum enzymes that are measured in clinical practice.</p><p>This topic will review the biochemistry of muscle enzymes and their use in clinical practice. The biochemistry and use of serum enzymes in patients with renal failure are discussed separately.

It is present in the highest concentrations in serum in response to muscle injury, is the most sensitive indicator of muscle injury, and is the best measure of the course of muscle injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>CK is located on the inner mitochondrial membrane, on myofibrils, and in the muscle cytoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is involved in cellular energy storage and transfer via two major effects:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It catalyzes the production of high-energy adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via transfer of a phosphate from creatine phosphate, which is the major storage reservoir of energy during muscle rest, to adenosine diphosphate (ADP).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It participates in the transfer of high-energy phosphate from its site of production in the mitochondria into the muscle cell cytoplasm where it is used during muscle contraction.</p><p/><p>CK is a dimer molecule and occurs in three distinct isoenzyme forms (termed MM, MB, and BB), which can be distinguished electrophoretically. Skeletal muscle has the highest concentration of CK of any tissue. Normal skeletal muscle CK is more than 99 percent MM with small amounts of MB. By comparison, cardiac tissue has the highest concentration of CK-MB, which accounts for approximately 20 percent of cardiac CK [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The concentration of MB in skeletal muscle increases in individuals with inflammatory myopathy or muscular dystrophy, in the resting muscles of well-trained elite athletes, and in many individuals after extreme exercise such as marathon running. This change is probably due to the increased number of regenerating muscle fibers in these conditions. Regenerating muscle fibers revert to the fetal state of increased MB production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. An increased ratio of serum CK-MB measured in inflammatory myopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] or in athletes after extreme exertion may be confused with myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Troponin I is a more specific marker for myocardial damage than CK-MB since it does not appear to be present in either normal or damaged skeletal muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>], while Troponin T may be present in inflamed or regenerating skeletal muscle paralleling the elevation of CK-MB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=troponin-testing-clinical-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Troponin testing: Clinical use&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Brain tissue CK consists of 90 percent CK-BB with the remainder CK-MM. Smaller amounts of CK are also found in the intestine, lung, and bladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Macro CK is a term used to refer to CK that has an increased molecular weight. Complexes of CK and immunoglobulin (type 1 macro CK) and CK and an undetermined protein (type 2 macro CK) are more slowly cleared from the circulation than normal CK, leading to elevated levels. Macro CK can be detected by CK isoenzyme electrophoresis, which is usually available in reference clinical laboratories. The two types of macro CK can then be distinguished by protein G affinity chromatography. In those laboratories reporting CK isoenzymes, macro CK will be reported as an increased CK-MB fraction, which may cause diagnostic confusion suggesting cardiac injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

While increased aldolase levels are not as specific or sensitive for muscle disease as CK levels, aldolase concentrations are occasionally elevated in patients with myositis who have normal CK levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Lactate dehydrogenase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) catalyzes the final step of glycolysis, converting pyruvate to lactate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. It is found in nearly every tissue of the body; as a result, increased serum levels are found in a great variety of disease states. There are five LDH isoenzymes, each consisting of tetrameric combinations of M and H chains. The LD1 isoenzyme is more common in cardiac tissue, and, in the setting of cardiac injury, the usual LD2 greater than LD1 ratio is reversed. LD5 predominates in skeletal muscle, but increased LD5 is also seen in hepatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Aminotransferases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The aminotransferases (transaminases) catalyze the conversion of the amino acids alanine and aspartate to alpha-ketoglutarate, providing a source of nitrogen for the urea cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Both enzymes are found widely in many tissues, and increased serum levels are a nonspecific indicator of disease. Serum concentrations are highest in various hepatic disorders, but increased values are also seen in skeletal muscle, myocardial disease, and hemolysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests#H19404948\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests&quot;, section on 'Elevated serum aminotransferases'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Rate of enzyme clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with an acute myocardial infarction, the increase in serum CK is short-lived while that of LDH persists. Thus, a patient seen a few days after the event may have elevations in LDH and in troponin but no elevation in the serum CK. It is uncertain if this distinction occurs with skeletal muscle injury. Limited data following exercise suggest that the time course of elevation in muscle enzymes is similar for CK, LDH, and the aminotransferases. Why the response to skeletal and cardiac muscle injury might be different is not known. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biomarkers of cardiac injury other than troponin&quot;, section on 'Lactate dehydrogenase'</a> and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Exercise'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MUSCLE ENZYMES IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF NEUROMUSCULAR DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In clinical practice, the measurement of serum muscle enzymes is most commonly used in the evaluation of the patient presenting with muscle weakness or myalgias in whom myopathy is suspected. In general, marked elevation of serum muscle enzymes is seen in myopathies. Thus, serum creatine kinase (CK) activity &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> helps to distinguish muscle disease from neurogenic causes of weakness and muscle atrophy. More modest elevation of CK may occur in some primary neurologic disorders, particularly motor neuron disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-muscle-weakness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with muscle weakness&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Motor neuron disease'</a> below.)</p><p>This section will review the disorders in which serum muscle enzyme concentrations are elevated either chronically (as in most myopathies) or acutely (as in reversible causes of rhabdomyolysis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69841\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69841 \">table 1</a>). This will be followed by a discussion of settings in which muscle enzymes can be used to follow the course of the disease and the response to therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammatory myopathies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In Bohan's original series of 153 patients with inflammatory myopathy (polymyositis and dermatomyositis), only two patients had persistently normal muscle enzymes throughout their clinical course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Subsequent reports have confirmed the nearly universal elevation of at least one of the muscle enzymes at some time during the course of active myositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. CK is the most commonly measured muscle enzyme, although at times aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), or the aminotransferases will be elevated in the absence of an elevated CK [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>]. It is not known why this occurs.</p><p>Rarely, clinical muscle disease with weakness and abnormal electromyography (EMG) and muscle biopsy findings occurs in the absence of muscle enzyme elevation. It has been suggested in these cases that an inhibitor of CK is present causing a false negative CK level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Slight elevation or normal levels of serum CK activity may be present in patients with inclusion body myositis.</p><p>In other patients, the rash of dermatomyositis is present without clinical muscle disease or elevated muscle enzymes, termed &quot;amyopathic dermatomyositis&quot; or &quot;dermatomyositis sine myositis&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

In this setting, a careful assessment of muscle strength and measurement of CK and aldolase should lead to the correct diagnosis of muscle disease and avoidance of an unnecessary liver biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Similarly, in juvenile dermatomyositis, at least one of the serum muscle enzymes is elevated at some time in the course of almost all cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

While these conditions represent a very small percentage of cases of rhabdomyolysis, they should be suspected in cases where no obvious precipitating factors are present, particularly when there is a history of recurrent episodes. The heritable metabolic myopathies are discussed in more detail elsewhere.

Patients with poorly controlled type I disease appear to be at highest risk of developing this otherwise rare disorder. The sudden onset of pain and localized swelling in the thigh or calf muscles that characterize muscle infarction must be distinguished from pyomyositis or other causes of localized myositis. The serum CK level may be normal or elevated. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is usually increased.

The periodic paralyses have been classified as primary or secondary depending upon whether there is a family history or an underlying condition such as thyrotoxicosis and, on the basis of serum potassium levels during an attack, as hypokalemic, hyperkalemic, or normokalemic. The common mechanism of these conditions appears to be an intermittent unexcitability of the muscle fiber membrane related to electrolyte shifts across the membrane.

Muscle enzyme levels generally decrease before improvement in muscle strength occurs; normalization of muscle enzymes with therapy is predictive of recovery of strength. In one study, for example, good clinical outcomes accompanied 17 of 17 myositis episodes in which muscle enzymes normalized but only 8 of 25 episodes in which muscle enzymes did not normalize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Failure to normalize muscle enzymes after two months should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses such as inclusion body myositis, muscular dystrophy, or hypothyroidism.</p><p>However, in some cases of severe disease, serum enzymes will fail to normalize even with aggressive corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-recurrent-and-resistant-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of recurrent and resistant dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Disease exacerbations are usually preceded by an increase in muscle enzymes. Thus, serial enzyme measurements are generally useful in assessing the disease course in an individual patient. In some cases, the elevations in serum creatine kinase (CK) or aminotransferase concentrations are within the normal range but are still a harbinger of increased clinical disease activity. If corticosteroids are tapered at the time of a mild increase in CK, a further increase in CK to outside the normal range and relapse of muscle weakness is likely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. By contrast, recurrence of weakness during corticosteroid treatment with no increase in serum enzymes is more likely to represent steroid myopathy than increased disease activity.</p><p>Muscle enzymes also tend to parallel disease activity in juvenile dermatomyositis. In one study, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were found to be better predictors of disease flares than CK [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. However, this observation must be confirmed before the general practice of monitoring the serum CK concentration is changed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Rhabdomyolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree of serum muscle enzyme elevation does not always predict the development of acute renal failure in rhabdomyolysis, although there is a general correlation. In one study, for example, 58 percent of patients developing acute renal failure had peak CK levels greater than 16,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> compared with only 11 percent in those who did not develop acute renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The peak CK elevation is usually reached quickly, occurring within the first day after the muscle insult. It then falls rapidly back to the normal range over several days to one week, depending on the maximum peak level. This rapid decline helps to distinguish rhabdomyolysis from more chronic disorders of myopathy such as polymyositis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The measurement of serum levels of muscle enzymes is a critical part of the evaluation of patients presenting with weakness or myalgias and is important in monitoring the course and response to therapy of certain muscular disorders. Creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and aldolase are the serum enzymes that are measured in clinical practice.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CK is the most widely used enzyme to diagnose and follow muscle disease. It is present in the highest concentrations in serum with muscle injury, is the most sensitive indicator of muscle injury, and is the best measure of the course of muscle injury. CK is located on the inner mitochondrial membrane, on myofibrils, and in the muscle cytoplasm, and it is involved in cellular energy storage and transfer. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Creatine kinase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CK is a dimer, which occurs in three distinct isoenzyme forms (termed MM, MB, and BB), which can be distinguished electrophoretically. Normal skeletal muscle CK is over 99 percent MM with small amounts of MB. The concentration of MB in skeletal muscle increases in individuals with inflammatory myopathy or muscular dystrophy, in the resting muscles of elite athletes, and in many individuals after extreme exercise. An increased ratio of serum CK-MB measured in inflammatory myopathies or in athletes after extreme exertion may be confused with myocardial infarction. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Creatine kinase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum aldolase concentrations are occasionally elevated in patients with myositis who have normal CK levels, but increased aldolase levels are not as specific or sensitive for muscle disease as CK levels. LDH and the aminotransferases are present in many tissues and are often elevated with skeletal muscle injury. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Aldolase'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Lactate dehydrogenase'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Aminotransferases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, marked elevation of serum muscle enzymes is seen in myopathies.
