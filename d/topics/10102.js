It keeps the heart beating regularly, helps to maintain fluid balance, and allows the nerves and muscles to work properly.</p><p>The kidneys are the main organ that controls the correct level of potassium in the blood. People who take certain medicines or who have chronic kidney disease must sometimes, under the direction of their clinician, limit the amount of potassium in their diet to keep their potassium level close to normal.</p><p>This article will discuss the normal level of potassium, how it is measured in the blood, and how to eat a low-potassium diet. A discussion of other treatments for chronic kidney disease is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHY SHOULD I REDUCE POTASSIUM IN MY DIET?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normally, the level of potassium in your body is balanced by eating foods that contain potassium and getting rid of excess potassium in the urine. However, people who have lost more than one-half their kidney function often cannot get rid of enough potassium in their urine because the kidneys do not work well.</p><p>In these people, the level of potassium in the blood can become higher than normal, causing a condition known as hyperkalemia (hyper = high, kal = potassium, emia = in the blood). Eating a lower-potassium diet can lower the risk of developing hyperkalemia.</p><p>The potassium level is measured by taking a small sample of blood from a vein. A typical normal range for potassium is 3.8 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. A level greater than 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> or less than 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> is considered dangerous. Blood potassium must be well regulated to prevent serious complications.</p><p>Hyperkalemia does not usually cause noticeable symptoms, even at very high levels. At levels above 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> there are usually changes on an electrocardiogram and the patient has nonspecific symptoms of not feeling well. At this level, dangerous complications can develop, including an irregular heart rhythm, severe muscle weakness, paralysis, or even sudden death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW MUCH POTASSIUM DO I NEED?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, experts recommend eating a diet that contains at least 4700 mg of potassium per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-potassium-diet-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, most people with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury should eat less than 2000 mg of potassium per day. People with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease have kidney function (ie, glomerular filtration rate, or &quot;GFR&quot;) below 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> (normal is 100 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span>.</p><p>A registered dietitian or nutritionist can help to create a low-potassium meal plan. An example of one such plan includes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82742\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82742 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63021\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63021 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fruit &ndash; One to three servings of low-potassium fruit per day </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vegetables &ndash; Two to three servings of low-potassium vegetables per day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dairy and calcium rich foods &ndash; One to two servings of low-potassium choices per day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meat and meat alternatives &ndash; Three to seven servings of low-potassium choices per day (approximately 15 percent of calories)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grains &ndash; Four to seven servings of low-potassium grains per day</p><p/><p>A sample diet plan is provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82742\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82742 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW DO I CUT DOWN ON POTASSIUM?</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Read the food label (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56605\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56605 \">figure 1</a>). Almost all foods contain some potassium, so the key is to choose foods with a low potassium level, when possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measure and be aware of the serving size when calculating the amount of potassium in a food; a large serving of a low-potassium food may have more potassium than a small serving of a food with a high level of potassium. Online or smartphone calculators for potassium can be useful in keeping track.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drain canned vegetables, fruits, and meats before serving.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Foods with high levels of potassium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Foods that have the highest concentrations of potassium include cantaloupe, all dried fruit and fruit juices, avocadoes, tomatoes, potatoes (plain and sweet), Brussels sprouts, milk, yogurt, lentils, and most nuts (except peanuts). The foods in the table have greater than 200 mg of potassium per serving and should be avoided or eaten in very small portions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67156\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67156 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>A process of &quot;leaching&quot; can reduce the amount of potassium in some vegetables. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Reducing potassium levels in vegetables'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Foods with low levels of potassium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The foods in this table have a low level of potassium (less than 200 mg potassium per serving on average) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63021\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63021 \">table 2</a>). You can eat low-potassium foods regularly, but limit your portion size since potassium can quickly add up if you eat a large portion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Reducing potassium levels in vegetables</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is possible to remove some of the potassium in certain vegetables with high potassium levels. Leaching is a process of soaking raw or frozen vegetables in water for at least two hours before cooking to &quot;pull&quot; some of the potassium out of the food and into the water. You should not eat these vegetables frequently because there is still a lot of potassium in the food after leaching.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash and then cut the raw vegetable into thin slices. Vegetables with a skin (eg, potatoes, carrots, beets, rutabagas) should be peeled before slicing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rinse the cut vegetables in warm water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soak the vegetables for at least two hours or overnight. Use a large amount of unsalted warm water (approximately 10 parts water to 1 part vegetables). If possible, change the water every four hours. Drain the soaking water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rinse the vegetables again with warm water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cook vegetables as desired, using a large amount of unsalted water (approximately 5 parts water to 1 part vegetables). Drain the cooking water.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=4427\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
