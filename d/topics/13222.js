It is primarily seen in children who sustain blunt trauma, occurring in 1 to 2 percent of such cases. The injury may involve bones, ligaments, blood vessels, or the spinal cord, and must be rapidly recognized and treated to avoid permanent disability or death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents#H349532277\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3240423178\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2887598882\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal motion restriction versus immobilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Precautions must be taken to limit the motion of the spine in any child who is suspected of having a cervical spine injury until the injury is excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Historically, the process of restricting the motion in the spine during emergency medical management was described as &quot;spinal immobilization.&quot; More recently, trauma experts have adopted the term &quot;spinal motion restriction&quot; for this process because true immobilization of the spine is unattainable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Cervical spine injuries in children frequently involve the axial spine and are at higher risk of being associated with spinal cord injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Spinal motion restriction should be established in the prehospital setting or upon presentation to the health care facility. It should be continued until injury is ruled out clinically or radiographically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Worsening of cervical cord injury may be avoided with proper spinal motion restriction and careful airway management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H689799690\"><span class=\"h2\">Neutral spine position</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The neutral position of the spine maximizes the spinal canal diameter to minimize further injury to the spinal cord and corresponds to &quot;the normal anatomic position of the head and torso that one assumes when standing and looking straight ahead&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. With the child lying supine on a flat surface and looking straight ahead, the neutral position for the cervical spine places the gaze perpendicular to that surface (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F114553\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114553 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In morphologically normal children, the neutral position also aligns the external auditory meatus with the shoulder in the coronal plane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Neutral position for the remainder of the spinal column refers to a position lying supine without obvious rotation or bending of the spinal column [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Neutral spine positioning in children requires special allowance for their relatively large head size, which varies by age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In particular, the prominent occiput in infants and young children forces the cervical spine into flexion when the patient is supine. Rigid longboards used for extricating children may be modified to facilitate the maintenance of neutral position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction/abstract/7,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,10</a>]. Some pediatric rigid longboards have depressed areas for the occiput in order to maintain neutral position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F114553\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114553 \">figure 1</a>). Alternatively, the back can be elevated by the placement of padding under the shoulders and extending to the lumbar region. In one prospective study of children younger than eight years, the mean back elevation needed to achieve a neutral position was 2.5 cm (1 inch) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Children older than eight years of age, adolescents, and adults require occipital elevation to maintain the neutral position when in the supine position. No consensus regarding the amount of elevation exists; the range described in the literature varies from 1.3 to 9.5 cm, with most authors favoring approximately 2 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction/abstract/5,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11</a>]. Correlation with spinal magnetic resonance imaging in a small series of adults suggests that 2 cm of occipital padding provides a favorable ratio of spinal canal to spinal cord cross-sectional area, but this finding is likely not generalizable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal motion restriction should be employed whenever there is clinical suspicion of cervical spine injury including any one of the following clinical findings (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents#H2558666249\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-risk mechanism of injury:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>High-risk motor vehicle collision (death of passenger in same compartment; passenger compartment intrusion &ndash; 12 inches at sides and 18 inches at roof; complete or partial ejection of patient)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diving injuries or those involving axial load biomechanics</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination findings that suggest cervical spine injury:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Altered mental status (including intoxication or drowsiness)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neck pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tenderness at the posterior midline of the cervical spine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Decreased range of neck motion on exam by patient report or based upon physical examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neurologic deficits</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Multiple system trauma, particularly when associated with severe injuries to the head or torso</p><p/><p>Cervical spine motion restriction is also warranted in those children who have an underlying predisposing factor (eg, developmental anomalies of the cervical spine as seen with Down or Klippel-Feil syndrome, impaired bone and soft tissue integrity such as occurring in osteogenesis imperfecta or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, cervical arthritis, or cervical spine surgery) even with trivial mechanisms of injury.

Compared with adults, children younger than eight years have relatively large heads, weak cervical muscles, and short necks which makes them particularly prone to axial cervical spine injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Anatomic considerations'</a>.)</p><p>As children grow, the cervical spine matures with adult patterns of injury typically present by 16 years of age. Protection of the cervical spine to prevent worsening of an existing spinal cord injury requires restricting motion in both the neck and the body. The neck is placed in a cervical collar, and the body is placed in the supine position, preferably on a soft conforming surface. Infants and young children warrant a cut out in the board or padding under the shoulders to maintain neutral position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F114553\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114553 \">figure 1</a>). Otherwise, the relatively large head and prominent occiput of the infant and young child pushes the neck into flexion when lying supine. Cervical spine motion restrictions should be applied while the airway is being assessed.</p><p>If a rigid longboard is used in the field, the typical order of spine motion restriction in trauma patients is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manual in-line stabilization of the cervical spine which may be augmented by a rigid cervical collar</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Log-rolling of the patient while cervical spine motion is being restricted to facilitate supine placement on a rigid longboard</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If not already in place, application of a rigid cervical collar</p><p/><p>Upon arrival at the hospital, patients with spinal motion restriction in place undergo rapid assessment of the neck and spine for signs of injury as part of the primary survey (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Airway with cervical spine motion restriction'</a>). Manual in-line stabilization is applied and maintained while the cervical collar is removed to facilitate palpation of the anterior and posterior neck. The cervical collar is reapplied or, if inappropriately sized in the field, replaced. Once the rigid cervical collar is in place, manual in-line stabilization is repeated when the patient is log-rolled for assessment of the back and rest of the spinal column. At this point, the rigid spine board is removed and the patient rolled back to a supine position on the gurney.</p><p>For infants and toddlers that arrive within car seats, the head and neck should be supported using manual in-line stabilization when removing them from the car seat, regardless of whether or not a rigid collar is in place.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2531830830\"><span class=\"h2\">Manual in-line stabilization of the cervical spine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To perform manual in-line stabilization of the cervical spine, the provider places the hands on both sides of the head with fingertips gently touching the clavicles (stabilization from behind the patient) or with the hand gently resting on the clavicles (stabilization from in front of the patient) and maintains the cervical spine in a neutral position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80874 \">figure 2</a>). The provider should <strong>not</strong> apply traction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Rigid cervical collars</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only rigid cervical collars should be used for motion restriction. Appropriate sizing is imperative to properly support a neutral cervical spine position. Furthermore, inappropriate sizing can promote excessive cervical spine flexion (collar is too short) or extension (collar is too tall). Because proper size depends upon the type of collar, the user should follow the manufacturer's recommendations for sizing.</p><p>As a general rule, high-cut collars are optimal because they provide points of support at the chin, angle of the jaw, the mastoid processes, and the occiput. This is of particular importance in the children as they are more likely to injure their axial cervical spine.</p><p>Many cervical collars are commercially available that provide sizing from infancy to adulthood:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stifneck (Laerdal)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspen Pediatric Collar (Aspen Medical Products)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Philadelphia (DeRoyal)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Miami J (Ossur Americas)</p><p/><p>These collars are expensive, and can be difficult for ambulances to stock the full range of sizes. Several companies market extrication collars that are more economical and easier to stock due to adjustable settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perfit ACE Extrication Collar <span class=\"nowrap\">(Ambu/DeRoyal)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extrication Collar (Matrix)</p><p/><p>The chin must fit securely into the chin cup of the collar. This will prevent flexion of the neck, which causes the chin to slide down into the collar. The mandible should not be forced posteriorly. This could compromise the airway. The lower portion of the collar should rest firmly on the chest and clavicles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1080017966\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternatives to rigid cervical collars</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rigid cervical collars are the preferred method for cervical spine motion restriction in almost all trauma patients. Exceptions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is not a commercially available cervical collar which properly fits the infant, child, or child with dysmorphic features (eg, Pierre Robin or Klippel Feil) a rolled towel can be placed around the neck, crossed in front of the neck over the chest and secured with tape.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In injured athletes, helmets and shoulder pads should be left in place unless they interfere with airway maintenance until arrival at the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Field care and evaluation of the child or adolescent athlete with acute neck injury&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prehospital providers sometimes keep infants and children within intact and visually undamaged car seats for transport if the child does not appear to be injured or acutely ill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. For infants and toddlers, cervical spine motion restriction may involve placing towel rolls on either side of the head or rolling a single towel and placing it in a horseshoe around the child's head. With either technique, the towel rolls are secured by taping them to the car seat. For infants and toddlers that arrive within car seats, the head and neck should be supported using manual in-line stabilization when removing them from the car seat, regardless of whether or not a rigid collar is in place.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with contraindications to rigid cervical collar placement (neck swelling, fixed neck deformity, need for cricothyrotomy, or collar placement exacerbates neurologic symptoms), cervical spine movement restriction can be temporarily maintained by manual in-line stabilization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80874 \">figure 2</a>). For patients with fixed deformities or whose symptoms are worsened by collar application, the patient can be allowed to assume a position of maximum comfort followed by placement of padding (eg, rolled towels or blankets) that are secured with tape to support this position. Care should be taken to ensure that tape does not impair airway management.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3393212388\"><span class=\"h2\">Log-roll procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although not always feasible in the prehospital setting, in most patients, a rigid cervical collar should be applied before rolling the patient. The log-roll procedure maintains the spine in a neutral position during rolling and requires four people to properly perform in adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60409\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60409 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) Program does not specify the number of people needed for log-rolling a child. However, in log-rolling a child, having one person solely responsible for maintaining the cervical spine in the neutral position is critical. Two to four additional people may be needed, depending upon the size of the child.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The arms are straightened and placed with palms inward next to the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The legs are straightened and ankles secured to each other with padding between them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient is rolled with the body as a unit onto the center of the gurney or the rigid longboard.</p><p/><p>Once in the supine position, a rigid cervical collar should be applied if not already in place. Once in the supine position on the gurney with or without a rigid longboard and with a cervical collar in place, the child should undergo rapid assessment and stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation.</p><p>When patients arrive in the emergency department on a rigid longboard, the log-roll procedure is also used to remove the child from the board. (See <a href=\"#H1042636969\" class=\"local\">'Rigid longboards'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3257848450\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1042636969\"><span class=\"h2\">Rigid longboards</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The routine use of rigid longboards in hospitalized trauma patients is now discouraged by the American College of Surgeons, the American College of Emergency Physicians, and the National Association of Emergency Medical Services Physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction/abstract/2,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15</a>]. Patients with known or suspected cervical spine injury should be positioned in the supine or semi-recumbent position on a soft conforming surface to relieve pressure points. In the prehospital setting, it may be necessary to secure a patient to a rigid longboard during patient transfers. This is most often the case when the patient has a comorbid condition that limits their mobility such as a severe head injury or extremity deformity. For children there are several rigid longboards that are marketed to accommodate their size and anatomy such as a half-sized rigid longboards or boards with occipital head recess.</p><p>The patient should be removed from the rigid longboard, if used, as soon as possible to avoid unnecessary pain and pressure sores. This goal is commonly accomplished during the exposure portion of the primary survey when the patient is log-rolled for evaluation of the flank and back. Patients in whom significant concern for spinal cord injury exists and who may remain on the rigid longboard for longer than 30 minutes, should have padding placed under the occiput, scapulae, sacrum, and heels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59634\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59634 \">figure 4</a>).

Orotracheal intubation with in-line manual stabilization provides the best approach to secure the airway in trauma victims without causing further cervical spine injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction/abstract/8,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,16-18</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal motion restriction techniques in children without contraindications to rigid cervical collar placement include manual in-line stabilization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80874 \">figure 2</a>), application of a rigid cervical collar and temporary placement on a rigid longboard if necessary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59634\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59634 \">figure 4</a>). Collars should be rigid, appropriately sized, and not interfere with management of the airway. The correct collar size varies with the collar type; the user should follow the manufacturer's recommendations for sizing. When placing a child in a cervical collar, the cervical spine should be manually stabilized until the collar can be applied (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80874 \">figure 2</a>). Care must be taken not to apply traction to the neck. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Techniques'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2531830830\" class=\"local\">'Manual in-line stabilization of the cervical spine'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Rigid cervical collars'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During airway management, the cervical collar should be opened and the cervical spine should be manually stabilized to prevent exacerbation of a spinal cord injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80874 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Motion restriction during airway management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraindications to rigid cervical collar placement include (see <a href=\"#H3504762130\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Presence of fixed neck deformity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Massive cervical swelling for which collar placement may impinge upon the airway</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Need to perform cricothyrotomy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Attempts at applying a collar worsen neurologic symptoms or neck pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with contraindications to rigid collar placement, cervical spine movement restriction can be temporarily maintained by manual in-line stabilization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80874 \">figure 2</a>). For patients with fixed deformities or whose symptoms are worsened by collar application, the patient can be allowed to assume a position of maximum comfort followed by placement of padding (eg, rolled towels or blankets) that are secured with tape to support this position. Care should be taken to ensure that the tape does not impair airway management. (See <a href=\"#H1080017966\" class=\"local\">'Alternatives to rigid cervical collars'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The child with cervical spinal motion restriction should be maintained in the neutral spine position. Neutral positioning in infants and young children requires special allowance for their relatively large head size. In particular, the prominent occiput in these patients forces the cervical spine into flexion when the child is supine. Some pediatric rigid longboards have depressed areas for the occiput in order to maintain neutral position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F114553\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114553 \">figure 1</a>). Alternatively, the back can be elevated by the placement of padding under the shoulders and extending to the lumbar spine if one of these special boards is not available. (See <a href=\"#H689799690\" class=\"local\">'Neutral spine position'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal motion restriction should be maintained until a cervical spine injury has been excluded clinically <span class=\"nowrap\">and/</span> or radiographically. However, the patient should be removed from the rigid longboard, if used, as soon as possible to avoid unnecessary pain and pressure sores. This goal is commonly accomplished during the exposure portion of the primary survey when the patient is log-rolled for evaluation of the flank and back. The log-roll procedure maintains the spine in a neutral position during rolling and requires one person to maintain in-line stabilization of the cervical spine and one to three people, depending upon the size of the patient, to perform the log-roll (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60409\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60409 \">figure 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3393212388\" class=\"local\">'Log-roll procedure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1042636969\" class=\"local\">'Rigid longboards'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients in whom significant concern for spinal cord injury exists and who may remain on the rigid longboard for longer than 30 minutes, should have padding placed under the occiput, scapulae, sacrum, and heels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59634\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59634 \">figure 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1042636969\" class=\"local\">'Rigid longboards'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When transferring a patient with spinal motion restrictions in place from the gurney to a radiology table or a hospital bed, a scoop stretcher (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F115887\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115887 \">figure 6</a>) or slide board (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F115888\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115888 \">figure 7</a>) can be used to transfer the patient safely between surfaces, but it should not be used for continued spinal motion restriction.
