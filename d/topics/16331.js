The term sporadic LAM is used for patients with LAM who do not have tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), while TSC-LAM refers to LAM that occurs in patients with TSC. The management of LAM is generally based upon supportive care, use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> to slow progression of respiratory impairment, and prevention or treatment of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The management, monitoring, and prognosis of sporadic LAM and its complications are reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and diagnostic evaluation are discussed separately.

While the long-term risk of isolated nocturnal desaturation is unknown, we prescribe supplemental oxygen for sleep-related hypoxemia when the SpO<sub>2</sub> decreases more than 5 percent for at least five minutes of sleep, the patient has symptoms or signs reasonably associated with desaturation (eg, pulmonary hypertension, erythrocytosis), and no other cause (eg, obstructive sleep apnea) is identified.

Another study of 40 patients with LAM reported rehabilitation was safe in those with a low physical activity level and led to improved exercise capacity, dyspnea, quality of life, and muscle strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

While traditionally women with LAM were advised to avoid eating foods containing phytoestrogens (eg, soy), there is no evidence that this strategy affects disease progression in LAM, and dietary restrictions based on hormonal influences of foods are not generally advised. A systematic review of the effects of soy and phytoestrogens in breast cancer concluded that soy does not have estrogenic activity in humans and is safe in the quantities consumed in a traditional Japanese diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Some patients appear to respond better to inhaled beta-agonists and others to inhaled anticholinergic agents. An empiric trial of each is appropriate with a view to chronic maintenance therapy for patients with a symptomatic response. The efficacy of inhaled glucocorticoids has not been formally examined. Their use is typically reserved for patients who are believed to have concomitant asthma.

In general, most LAM patients can undertake air travel safely.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumothorax &ndash; Patients with LAM are reported to have a small but increased risk of pneumothorax during flight (2 to 4 percent; 1 to 2 per 100 flights). Decisions regarding the safety of air travel are influenced by factors including the burden of cysts, degree of lung function impairment, history of pneumothoraces, and an assessment of cardiopulmonary reserve in the event of an in-flight pneumothorax. In general, air travel is considered to be safe in most patients with LAM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. However, patients with reduced pulmonary reserve or high-risk features (eg, high burden of cysts, severe lung function impairment, history of multiple pneumothoraces) may prefer to seek alternative modes of travel. Patients with unexplained or new onset chest pain or dyspnea should be evaluated with a chest radiograph prior to air travel. Additional details regarding air travel and pneumothorax are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumothorax-and-air-travel\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumothorax and air travel&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This approach is based upon data from two small retrospective series:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In one series of 281 patients with LAM, the risk of a new pneumothorax on chest radiograph or computed tomography was 3 percent in those who traveled by air (1.1 per 100 flights) compared with less than 2 percent for those who traveled by land (0.5 per 100 trips) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A new pneumothorax was more likely in patients with large cysts and more severe disease, regardless of the mode of travel. Over half had evidence of chronic pneumothorax that remained unchanged following travel. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a questionnaire-based evaluation derived from 276 patients with LAM who reported air travel (454 flights), most women travelled without serious adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, a small proportion reported air travel-related dyspnea (14 percent), chest pain (12 percent), pneumothorax (4 percent; most identified by chest radiograph), and oxygen desaturation (8 percent). The rate of pneumothoraces was 2.2 pneumothoraces per 100 flights.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supplemental oxygen &ndash; When assessing the need for supplemental oxygen during flight, the principles of management should be similar to those with other lung diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traveling with oxygen aboard commercial air carriers&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumothorax-and-air-travel\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumothorax and air travel&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1693646158\"><span class=\"h3\">Exogenous estrogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LAM exacerbations have been associated with use of exogenous systemic estrogen (eg, birth control pills, hormone replacement, ovulation induction agents for assisted reproduction) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F89046\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89046 \">table 3</a>), and exposure to these agents should be minimized (eg, for egg harvest) or avoided. Low dose topical estrogen creams, tablets, and rings used for atrophic vaginitis are generally felt to be safe in survivors of breast cancer, and by extrapolation, in patients with LAM who do not respond to nonhormonal approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H373198914\"><span class=\"h3\">Pregnancy and birth control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should inform women with LAM about the increased risks associated with pregnancy including pneumothorax, chylothorax, lung disease progression, and hemorrhage into angiomyolipomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,13-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13-22</a>]. Although some patients have tolerated pregnancy without long-term consequences, many patients do have LAM-related complications, and there are no factors that reliably predict risk. Because of the uncertainty, many women with LAM choose to avoid pregnancy. For patients who do choose to become pregnant, those with excellent lung function and a quiescent disease course at baseline are better positioned to assume risk, while those with severe lung impairment or rapidly declining disease, recurrent pneumothorax, chylothorax, or angiomyolipomas may be at increased risk.</p><p>This approach is based upon small retrospective series which report that between one- and two-thirds of women with LAM have been pregnant at some point in their lifetime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/19,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,23</a>], but in most studies it is unclear if LAM was present during pregnancy. In addition, in women who are discovered to have LAM during pregnancy, it is rare to have prepregnancy lung function tests available for comparison, making it challenging to draw firm conclusions regarding disease progression due to pregnancy. It is unlikely that large trials will be conducted to help clinicians and patients with this decision. Our approach is the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Options for birth control</strong> &ndash; Selecting a method for contraception should be done in conjunction with a subspecialist; it is typically individualized and dependent upon patient preferences. Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives should be avoided since exogenous estrogens are thought to exacerbate the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. Potential options for contraception include sterilization, progesterone-only subcutaneous implants, intrauterine devices (IUDs; copper or progesterone-releasing), oral or injectable progesterone, and barrier protection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F89046\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89046 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57795 \">figure 2</a>).

There are no obvious contraindications to the use of a copper IUD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-contraception\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency contraception&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pregnancy</strong> &ndash; For women who choose to become pregnant, comanagement with a maternal fetal medicine specialist is advised. The risk of fetal anomalies or spontaneous abortions is unknown but does not appear to be increased. Since sporadic LAM is not inheritable, genetic counseling is typically not necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of antepartum fetal surveillance&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Surveillance with pulmonary function testing is advised approximately every three months during gestation in addition to ongoing monitoring for complications of LAM. While there is no consensus, the choice of delivering by cesarean section or vaginally (with or without regional anesthesia and instrumental assistance) should be individualized and is typically influenced by factors including the severity of lung impairment and risk of pneumothorax during delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Successful pregnancies have been reported in women taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> (for LAM or for immune suppression following transplant) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. However, sirolimus is listed as a level C medication and, as such, is not typically recommended in pregnancy. It is unknown whether sirolimus is secreted in breast milk, and breast-feeding while taking sirolimus is not advised.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2151552941\"><span class=\"h3\">Others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deep-sea diving and mountain climbing could theoretically increase the risk of pneumothorax, so patients are advised against participating in these activities.</p><p>LAM cells have been isolated from the peripheral blood of untreated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. However, no reports of transmitting LAM via blood have been published to date and it is unclear whether or not patients with LAM can safely donate blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H818158703\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF PULMONARY LAM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key treatment for parenchymal lung disease due to sporadic LAM is inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>. In general, sirolimus is indicated for symptomatic patients with abnormal lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] &lt;70 percent predicted) and evidence of progressive disease as well as for those with problematic chylous accumulations. It is important to consider the baseline trajectory of illness in making treatment decisions (eg, postmenopausal women may have a slower rate of decline), because the drug has toxicities and continuous exposure is required for durable benefit. Lung transplantation may be the only option for patients with advanced LAM or in those refractory to mTOR inhibitors.</p><p>Our strategy for the treatment of LAM is similar to that of others but differs slightly from that of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) because sentinel publications regarding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> were not available during the preparation of the ERS guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Given the complexities and multisystem nature of LAM, we encourage referral to centers with expertise in this disorder. (See <a href=\"#H1383681417\" class=\"local\">'Additional resources'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2859911392\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal or mildly impaired lung function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients with normal or mildly impaired pulmonary function, we suggest supportive measures, treatment of complications as they arise, and monitored observation, rather than treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>. While there is no agreed upon threshold, we consider those with a FEV<sub>1</sub> &ge;70 percent predicted as having mild disease and those who have a FEV<sub>1</sub> within the standard confidence limits as having normal function. (See <a href=\"#H2615773410\" class=\"local\">'General measures'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1820065254\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of complications'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1928617125\" class=\"local\">'Monitored observation'</a> below.)</p><p>A concern with this approach is that some patients, especially those with rapidly progressive disease, may benefit from a more aggressive, &quot;pre-emptive&quot; treatment strategy.

Thus, we typically perform a formal clinical assessment and PFTs (post-bronchodilator spirometry, lung volumes [forced vital and total lung capacity], and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide [DLCO]), at 6 and 12 months, and post-bronchodilator spirometry alone during interval visits at 3 and 9 months. There is no agreed upon definition of fast versus slowly declining lung function, but in our practice we arbitrarily consider those with a FEV<sub>1</sub> decline of &ge;100 mL per year (roughly three times the normal rate of FEV<sub>1</sub> decline in adults) as &quot;fast decliners&quot; and consider initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> in this subgroup. In contrast, if lung function declines slowly or is stable, testing intervals can be extended to every 6 or 12 months until a definite indication to treat with sirolimus is reached.

The expense and risk of radiation exposure (1.5 to 7 mSv annually) is weighed against the likelihood that a repeat scan will change management. Thus, for sporadic LAM patients with normal or mildly reduced lung function, we obtain additional HRCT only to investigate new symptoms suggestive of disease progression or complications. With further advancements in low-dose radiation CT, this approach might evolve in the future. Monitoring of angiomyolipomas is discussed separately.

Our philosophy is that we are obligated to find the lowest effective dose while optimizing long-term safety. In contrast, we often decrease the dose, transiently or permanently, in patients experiencing adverse effects that affect patient safety, quality of life, or compliance. Sirolimus should be held temporarily (ie, one week before and one week after) for intercurrent illnesses involving fever or deep infection and for elective surgeries due to its immunosuppressant and delayed wound-healing effects.

Pleurectomy is usually reserved for recurrences that follow a prior attempt at pleurodesis.

However, we prefer VATS-guided mechanical abrasion as the initial choice, because it is less likely to complicate the removal of the native lung if transplant is required in the future. Talc and pleurectomy are associated with the highest risk of technical complications (eg, bleeding) during future transplantation due to the induction of intense inflammation and pleural symphysis (features that are also responsible for its high efficacy).

The term sporadic LAM is used for patients with pulmonary LAM who do not have tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General measures used to treat LAM include reassurance, use of supplemental oxygen, avoidance of estrogen-containing medications, bronchodilators, pulmonary rehabilitation, and interventions to manage complications. The strategic use of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>, slows progression of respiratory impairment but is not curative. Early referral to a LAM center is prudent for shared care between LAM experts and local pulmonologists. (See <a href=\"#H2615773410\" class=\"local\">'General measures'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1820065254\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with LAM who have normal or mildly impaired lung function defined as a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) &ge;70 percent, we suggest monitored observation with frequent lung function assessments at three month intervals rather than treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Sirolimus may be appropriate in this population when the FEV<sub>1</sub> remains within the normal range but is rapidly declining (eg, 100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/year)</span> or there are lung function abnormalities suggestive of a significant burden of LAM in the lung such as evidence of air trapping (RV &gt;120 percent), abnormal diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO &lt;80 percent), or desaturation with exercise. (See <a href=\"#H2859911392\" class=\"local\">'Normal or mildly impaired lung function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with sporadic LAM who have moderate to severe lung impairment, as defined by a FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;70 percent predicted, we recommend treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> rather than observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In select patients, a short period of observation is prudent to assess disease progression before initiating sirolimus (eg, postmenopausal women with good pulmonary reserve may have stable lung function). Sirolimus is typically administered at 1 to 2 mg orally per day and adjusted to minimize adverse effects ensuring that the trough level does not exceed 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. While the optimal duration of therapy is unknown, we generally continue sirolimus indefinitely, as tolerated. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Everolimus</a> is an alternative mTOR inhibitor for those who don&rsquo;t tolerate or respond to sirolimus. (See <a href=\"#H1087120726\" class=\"local\">'Moderate to severe lung function impairment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have progressive lung disease despite <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>, options include increasing the dose of sirolimus toward the upper end of the therapeutic range (ie, 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL),</span> a trial of replacement with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a>, participation in clinical trials, and referral for lung transplantation. Although <strong>not</strong> routinely recommended, hormonal manipulation is sometimes administered in this population. Choosing among these options is dependent upon factors including patient preference and pulmonary reserve. (See <a href=\"#H235446075\" class=\"local\">'Refractory disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with LAM and a pneumothorax, after chest tube drainage, we recommend ipsilateral pleurodesis at the time of the initial pneumothorax, rather than waiting for a recurrent event (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). We favor mechanical pleurodesis via a video-assisted thoracoscopy and reserve talc for those who fail this approach. (See <a href=\"#H3494275254\" class=\"local\">'Pneumothorax'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with symptomatic chylous accumulations or lymphangioleiomyomas, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> rather than other therapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2807268613\" class=\"local\">'Chylothorax and chylous ascites'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several other agents are under investigation (eg, statins; <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=lymphangioleiomyomatosis&amp;token=JKcSmCXgdKvw9eDYrJDw9qvUgeZq8gSV4HXk+VPTKJns5fdd7rDwxo2DOsnPl0CpA5CvqlJqn32Zp82yhLxAGHyomZdBJQOGg156Zb8mThs=&amp;TOPIC_ID=107652\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Clinicaltrials.gov</a>) or have been studied in the past and found to be of no or unclear benefit (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>). Hormonal manipulation has not been shown to be effective for treatment of LAM and should <strong>not</strong> be used routinely to treat LAM. (See <a href=\"#H4168421505\" class=\"local\">'Clinical trials'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3762237998\" class=\"local\">'Therapy of unclear benefit'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated median transplant-free survival time for pulmonary LAM is 29 years from symptom onset and 23 years from diagnosis. Factors associated with poor prognosis are often those that are associated with faster rates of decline in lung function. The impact of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> on mortality and need for lung transplantation is unclear.
