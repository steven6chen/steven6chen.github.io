In fact, nearly everyone will experience muscle soreness at some point in their life. Unusually excessive exertion, trauma, and viral infections are among the most common causes. While many causes are benign and self-limited, myalgia may be the harbinger of disorders associated with significant morbidity.</p><p>A thorough review of the patient's history and a complete physical examination can usually narrow the list of potential causes of myalgia to a manageable few. For persistent or severe myalgia without a known cause, selected testing may be necessary to identify or exclude specific diagnoses and to direct treatment.</p><p>It is important to differentiate myalgia from myopathy (muscle disease) and myositis (muscle inflammation). Although myopathy and myositis may cause myalgia, most individuals with myalgia have neither. It is also useful to separate diffuse from localized symptoms. This review will discuss the approach to myalgia as a presenting symptom to a primary care clinician, focusing on etiology, history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and management. Specific disorders characterized by prominent myalgia are covered elsewhere.

This may relate in part to the need to follow symptoms over time and to obtain laboratory or other diagnostic studies. In fact, the course of symptoms and signs over time may be particularly helpful. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Muscle symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>The list of conditions associated with myalgia is long (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60716\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60716 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61398\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61398 \">table 2</a>). In patients with a characteristic pattern of symptoms, the diagnosis may be established promptly. However, considerable uncertainty is common after initial evaluation. Selective testing and vigilant follow-up may be necessary for several months to narrow the list of potential explanations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Serious conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early in the evaluation of patients with myalgia, the clinician should attempt to identify those patients with a serious or life-threatening condition. Conditions causing myalgia may cause significant suffering, but true medical emergencies presenting with myalgia are rare. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are required for bacterial infections, especially endocarditis and impending sepsis, which may present with diffuse myalgia, fever, chills, arthralgia, fatigue and back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-myalgia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Rhabdomyolysis can present with diffuse myalgias, as well as renal failure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> compartment syndrome in severe cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of adults with suspected native valve endocarditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient's history provides a useful starting point in narrowing down the long list of potential causes for myalgia. Particular attention should be given to mode of onset, location of pain, and associated symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Muscle symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in sorting out the cause of myalgia is to understand the specific nature of the patient's muscle pain:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Did the muscle pain begin suddenly or gradually? If sudden in onset, did it follow trauma or an unusually strenuous activity? Is the muscle pain worse in the morning?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As an example, acute onset with prominent constitutional symptoms suggests infection (such as bacterial sepsis, pyomyositis, influenza or acute hepatitis B). Acute onset of myalgia in the neck, shoulders, upper arms, buttocks, and thighs in an older adult is characteristic of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), especially if accompanied by morning stiffness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Subacute myalgia is typical of a medication-induced cause (such as statin-induced myalgia), and can occur weeks to months after initiating therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Insidious onset and chronic symptoms are typical of infection with chronic hepatitis C, hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia, and vitamin D deficiency. This is also the typical pattern for patients with fibromyalgia; chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID); myofascial pain syndrome; and a somatization disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, muscle pain and stiffness in the morning is highly suggestive of PMR or other inflammatory arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the muscle pain associated with pain elsewhere? Is it near joints? If so, are they axial joints, such as the shoulder and hips? Shoulder and hip pathology, in particular, tend to cause referred pain to proximal muscles. Referred pain accounts for the prominent myalgia described by patients with PMR and rheumatoid arthritis involving the shoulders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a particular distribution of muscle pain? Statin-induced myalgia typically presents as proximal, symmetric muscle weakness and soreness. In contrast, diffuse myalgia, fever, headache, malaise, and a nonproductive cough are typical of a viral infection, such as influenza. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=statin-muscle-related-adverse-events\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Statin muscle-related adverse events&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of seasonal influenza in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there redness, swelling or warmth in the area of the muscle pain? Is the muscle painful to touch? Pyomyositis, abscess, muscle infarction, or compartment syndrome may cause focal muscle tenderness. Pyomyositis and abscess may cause localized inflammatory findings as well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the myalgia associated with muscle weakness? Is it difficult to arise from a chair or reach above the head? Objective muscle weakness is not expected with fibromyalgia, myofascial pain syndrome, or PMR; these common causes of muscle pain can be placed lower on the list of possibilities in the face of demonstrable muscle weakness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-muscle-weakness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with muscle weakness&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have there been muscle cramps? The etiology of muscle cramps is often not found, but can be caused by several conditions:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Structural disorders such as flat feet</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Unusual positioning during work or sleep</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neurologic disorders such as Parkinson disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Muscle injury such as trauma or fall</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dehydration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Exercise-associated muscle cramping</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Electrolyte abnormalities</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medications such as diuretics, statins, and beta agonists.</p><p/><p>Leg cramps occurring at night are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nocturnal-leg-cramps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nocturnal leg cramps&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Associated symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence or absence of associated symptoms can be quite helpful in pointing toward or against a particular cause. The clinician should undertake a detailed review of systems with particular attention paid to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constipation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint pain or swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paresthesias</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rash or hyperpigmentation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight change</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea</p><p/><p>Constipation, fatigue, and weight gain are common symptoms of hypothyroidism, whereas rash or hyperpigmentation are suggestive of infection or adrenal insufficiency, respectively. Fever raises the possibility of infection or systemic rheumatic disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus) or autoinflammatory disease (such as familial Mediterranean fever) while joint swelling suggests inflammatory arthritis. Paresthesias suggest a neuropathic condition which may cause myalgia due to referred pain or indicate the presence of a vasculitic process.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Other history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of myalgia may not be apparent until additional details of the patient's medical history are revealed. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient demographics, such as age and gender. For example, newly diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis are most common among young adult women, while PMR is seen exclusively among adults over the age of 55.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Past medical history, such as a prior diagnosis of thyroid disease, hepatitis C, diabetes, or hyperparathyroidism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medication use, especially statin administration, can lead to myalgias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Myalgia due to statin or fibrate medications may be associated with weakness and an elevation in creatine kinase (CK), but these features are often absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-myalgia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Drug interactions account for many cases of medication-induced myalgia or myopathy, particularly in patients taking statins and inhibitors of CYP3A4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76992 \">table 3</a>). A number of other common medications may be associated with myalgia, including bisphosphonates and aromatase inhibitors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, abrupt discontinuation of serotonin-reuptake inhibitors with short half-lives (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a>) may cause significant myalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-myalgia/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Muscle symptoms that follow the administration of a new medication should prompt the clinician to consider drug-induced muscle pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=statin-muscle-related-adverse-events\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Statin muscle-related adverse events&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-myopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced myopathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trauma, a change in activity or function, recent injury, or unusually strenuous exercise may trigger muscle pain, which is typically localized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Understanding the functional status of the patient or a recent change in function can help determine the pace and direction of the evaluation. For example, the possibility of myopathy is raised by a patient with myalgia who has difficulty arising from a chair or with activities of daily living. For individuals with longstanding myalgia without alteration in function, fibromyalgia should be a prime consideration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A psychologic assessment may aid in the diagnosis of depression or a somatization disorder as a cause of myalgia.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the history can provide important clues to the cause of myalgia, the physical examination can provide compelling, objective evidence for myopathy (muscle disease) or an alternative explanation for the symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Muscle examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although it can be difficult for a patient with myalgia to cooperate fully with a muscle examination, the finding of weakness can be particularly helpful in narrowing down the list of possible causes of symptoms by excluding many. For example, the finding of proximal muscle weakness in all four extremities in a patient with myalgia should turn the focus of diagnostic considerations to inflammatory myopathy (such as polymyositis), hypothyroidism, drug-induced myopathy, or hypercalcemia. Identifying objective weakness is important because weakness (with or without myalgia) is a common complaint even in the absence of demonstrable loss of motor function.</p><p>Even patients with significant pain can usually give maximum effort at least briefly to provide the examiner with a sense of whether muscle strength is normal. Besides assessing muscle strength in the usual proximal and distal muscle groups (including deltoids, wrist extensors, grip, thigh flexors, and ankle flexors and extensors), assessment of neck flexor strength may be useful as these muscles are a powerful and often overlooked proximal muscle group.</p><p>Besides the assessment of weakness, helpful findings on muscle examination may include focal swelling or erythema, which should raise the possibility of pyomyositis or other localized infection. Severe, localized tenderness without inflammatory features suggests muscle infarction or compartment syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-muscle-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic muscle infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It should be noted that muscle weakness without pain includes a much broader differential diagnosis discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-muscle-weakness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with muscle weakness&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">General physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The source of myalgia may lie far from the muscles. For this reason, as well as the fact that diseases causing myalgia may affect other organ systems, a thorough physical examination should follow, with particular attention to the presence of the following physical findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever (which may suggest viral infection, pyomyositis, endocarditis, or impending sepsis)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotension (as may be found in patients with sepsis)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperpigmentation and postural hypotension (as may be present in adrenal insufficiency)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous lesions (such as those found in systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, Lyme disease, psoriasis, or endocarditis)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ecchymoses (suggestive of recent trauma)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited shoulder and hip range of motion (consistent with PMR) or spinal disease (as may be noted in patients with spondyloarthropathy)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint inflammation (swelling, heat, warmth, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> limited motion) in the peripheral joints (as is typical of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bursal or tendon tenderness with more limitation of active motion than passive motion (compatible with bursitis or tendonitis)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tender points (as with fibromyalgia) or trigger points (suggestive of myofascial pain syndrome), although the ability to distinguish tender and trigger points is controversial.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia#H1397504\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia&quot;, section on 'Myofascial pain syndromes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe, focal muscle pain should suggest the possibility of muscle infarction, compartment syndrome, or pyomyositis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed relaxation of reflexes, slowed speech, dry skin, hoarse voice or other signs of hypothyroidism</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depressed or flattened affect (as an indication of depression or as associated with a somatization disorder)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For mild symptoms, watchful waiting without laboratory evaluation may be appropriate, as symptoms often resolve on their own with time. However, for more significant symptoms (eg, severe pain or muscle weakness), selected laboratory studies may be quite helpful in ruling in or ruling out conditions that remain in the differential diagnosis after a detailed history and physical examination.</p><p>As an initial assessment, complete blood count, urinalysis, and measures of renal and liver function are appropriate for most patients with significant myalgia. Depending upon the specific symptoms, risk factors and physical findings, measures of serum calcium, albumin, phosphate, TSH, CK, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D may be appropriate to assess.</p><p>The following tests may also prove helpful in certain clinical situations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60716\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60716 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood cultures and serologic testing for infectious agents (such as parvovirus and viral hepatitis)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ESR, CRP &ndash; These may be helpful to identify the presence of systemic inflammation, as with infection and systemic rheumatic disease (especially PMR and inflammatory myopathy). On the other hand, a normal ESR is the expected finding in patients with fibromyalgia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, caution must be taken in interpreting these test results as elevations in the ESR and CRP are not specific. In addition, normal or unimpressive results rarely rule out a particular cause of myalgia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoantibodies, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA) for suspected systemic lupus erythematosus, anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) for suspected ANCA-associated vasculitis, as well as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies for suspected rheumatoid arthritis, should be limited to those patients for whom there is at least a moderate pre-test probability of disease. Widespread testing with these autoantibody tests for all patients with myalgia is likely to produce an unacceptably high rate of false-positive results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-and-clinical-significance-of-antinuclear-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement and clinical significance of antinuclear antibodies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biologic markers in the diagnosis and assessment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing of cortisol production, such as morning serum cortisol or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test, are helpful to diagnose or rule out adrenal insufficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Other studies</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging &ndash; Radiographs, MRI, and other imaging tests are not routinely necessary in the evaluation of myalgia.

Features of the history, physical examination, and selective testing may prove particularly useful to identify the etiology that will guide management.</p><p>If medication-induced myalgia is suspected, a trial off the medication is warranted, though only after balancing the clinical improvement gained from such a trial with the risks of stopping the drug. It may take weeks or even months, however, to get a clear sense of whether myalgia was related to a medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-myalgia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A notable exception is polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), a condition in which a rapid and dramatic improvement within a few days of low-dose corticosteroid treatment is typical. In fact, this prompt response to treatment can help confirm the diagnosis.</p><p>When the cause cannot be readily identified, patients should be closely observed and treated symptomatically.
