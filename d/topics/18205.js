It keeps a girl from growing normally and from developing normal ovaries. It can also cause problems with the kidneys, heart, and other organs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92375096\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Turner syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Girls with Turner syndrome can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be short</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a square-shaped chest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be born with swollen or puffy hands and feet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a webbed neck</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have nipples that are far apart</p><p/><p>Girls with Turner syndrome do not have normal ovaries, so they usually do not go through puberty on their own. That means they do not form breasts or have periods unless they are treated with female hormones. They also do not grow as much as they should unless they take growth hormone shots.</p><p>Girls with Turner syndrome are usually as smart as those without the condition, but they can have trouble with certain types of mental tasks. They can also have other problems, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney or liver problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hearing loss and ear infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye problems</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92375111\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for Turner syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If a doctor or nurse thinks a child might have Turner syndrome, he or she can order a blood test to look for the genetic problem that causes it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92375126\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Turner syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no way to cure Turner syndrome, but there are ways to reduce the problems it causes. Girls can be treated with hormones to help them grow to a normal height and to go through the changes that normally happen at puberty. At various points throughout their lives, they must also be checked for the problems that Turner syndrome can cause. This involves hearing tests, many different blood tests, and some tests to check the condition of the heart. If any of those problems happen, they must get treated for those as well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92375141\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my daughter wants to have children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even with treatment, many girls with Turner syndrome can't have children when they grow up. Some can get pregnant with a special treatment called &quot;in-vitro fertilization,&quot; which uses another woman's eggs. If your daughter wants to have children, when she is ready, she should ask her doctor what her options are.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92375156\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my child's life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Girls with Turner syndrome need special medical attention all of their lives. When your child grows up, make sure she understands that she should keep getting check-ups every year. The doctor should check her for signs of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High cholesterol</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hearing loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteoporosis (a condition that weakens bones)</p><p/><p>The Turner Syndrome Society of the United States has more information on the types of care people with Turner syndrome need.
