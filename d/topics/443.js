As the 21<sup>st</sup> century unfolds, society will continue to be challenged by adolescent sexual behavior and its consequences. Although medical providers often discuss adolescent sexuality in terms of &quot;risk,&quot; it is important to remember that sexuality, sexual behaviors, and sexual relationships are an important and necessary part of human development. Paradigms of adolescent sexuality are broadening from risk to well-being, from targeted to comprehensive efforts, and from increasing knowledge to building skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Responsible sexual behavior (eg, delaying initiation of sexual intercourse, choosing caring and respectful partners, increasing the use of condoms, and using effective contraception) is an important public health issue. The United States Healthy People 2020 goals include improved pregnancy planning and spacing; prevention of unintended pregnancy; promotion of healthy sexual behaviors; and increased access to quality services to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and their complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The World Health Organization and other agencies interested in international health also identify adolescent-friendly health services as a worldwide priority [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], with 70 percent of more than 1 billion youth (10 to 19 years) living in developing countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Among adolescents in the United States:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Young women reach puberty and sexual maturity (eg, breast development, menarche) at earlier ages than ever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Understanding sexuality as a normal and necessary part of adolescent development can help providers use a strength-based approach when counseling adolescents. Appropriate screening, education, and support can empower and encourage teens to make healthy safer sexual decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Additional anticipatory guidance topics for adolescents are discussed separately.

Approaching sexuality as a paradigm of intersecting factors between gender and sex can help providers begin to appreciate the complexities of the developing adolescent sexuality. Understanding terminology and distinctions between seemingly similar constructs is helpful in providing appropriate patient care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Biologic, anatomic, or natal sex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic, hormonal, and anatomic characteristics determine whether a person is a biologic female or male. Biologic sex typically is defined by medical assessment of genitalia during infancy. Children then are reared according to their biologically or anatomically assigned sex, with little additional thought given to the individual's psychologic or behavioral self-identification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Anatomic sex usually is viewed as a binary concept, male or female. Rare individuals harbor both male and female gonadal tissue (ovotesticular disorder of sexual development). Patients with disorders of sexual development may have subtle or obvious genital abnormalities that present during the newborn period, childhood, or adolescence. Disorders of sexual development are discussed separately.

Current models of gender theory move beyond two dimensions and include variations of self-identification and terminology such as: gender variance, gender queer, gender fluid, two spirit, or transgender. In general, transgender refers to individuals whose gender role or gender identity is not congruent with their biologic or anatomically assigned sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].

An individual person's assessment of her or his sexual orientation is termed sexual identity. Sexual behavior alone is neither a sensitive nor a specific predictor of adolescent gender identification, sexual orientation, or sexual identity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In the 2005 to 2007 New York City Youth Risk Behavior Surveys, 39 percent of adolescents with only same or both sex partners self-identified as heterosexual or straight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Formation of sexual identity among youth often is fluid, and experimentation with same-gender sexual contacts can be part of healthy adolescent development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Heterosexual youth may experiment with same-gender sexual partners. Homosexual youth may have opposite-gender sexual partners. Either group may abstain from sexual activity altogether.

Considerable debate persists about Kinsey's hypothesis with increasing sophistication about the specific elements of &quot;nature&quot; versus &quot;nurture&quot; determinants of gender identity and sexual orientation. Prenatal exposure to androgens, neurologic structures and functions, and other neurophysiologic theories are currently linked to both gender development and sexual orientation, though in ways that are not entirely clear.

An individual's impression of gender or sexuality often is conveyed first to him or her by parents during early childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Parents or other immediate family members help children define what is male and female and how they express themselves as members of their gender. Some authors argue that social environments after birth may have little or no impact on gender identity or sexual orientation, with prenatal hormones having major effects on organizing developing sexuality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>As children become adolescents, influences broaden with peer, media, and community norms of gender and sexuality impacting their individual value systems. Media exerts a powerful influence on adolescents and their perception of gender roles and sexual behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. American adolescents are exposed to several hours of media (television, radio, internet) each day, during which they experience significant exposure to sexual content, which often contains implicit and explicit references to intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. Electronic media and social networking provide adolescents with even more ways to explore their burgeoning sexuality. Online social networking sites for adolescents frequently mention or feature sex and sexual behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. In a national survey of United States teenagers (ages 13 to 19), 20 percent self-reported sending and 48 percent reported receiving sexual messages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Longitudinal research consistently links degree of exposure to sexuality in the media to increased sexual risk taking and adverse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Adolescent sexuality occurs in the context of many other aspects of adolescent development and is more complicated for sexual minorities or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQQ) youth. Regardless of the acronyms and current issues in terminology, the individual youth is the person best suited to describe and define identity and behaviors. Many youth refuse categorization, preferring more diffuse terminology such as gender queer, queer, pansexual, or fluid regarding gender and sexuality. What matters for most youth is that the provider asks about their personal perspective, experience, and what terminology best suits their needs.</p><p>Problems may arise for adolescents who encounter conflict between their emerging sexuality and the approach to sexuality they experience from families, peers, culture, and society as a whole. Role modeling, sex education, and other information for developing adolescents often has a solely heterosexual focus, with homosexuality considered a social or religious taboo. Family connectedness, social support at school, and community support for its LGBTQQ members, as well as a strong caring adult mentor, seem to provide some resiliency and protectedness for sexual minority youth.

Middle teens can begin to imagine the consequences of their actions but still may not fully understand them and, because of this, engage in risk-taking behaviors such as substance use and unprotected sexual activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Late adolescence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Late adolescents (ages 18 and up) have more mature social skills, empathy, and an understanding of risks and consequences that help them develop more intimate and serious relationships.

While vaginal-penile intercourse, with its inherent risks for pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection (STI), has been the best researched, many of these other sexual behaviors may serve as a prelude to intercourse or substitute for intercourse for teens wishing to preserve their &quot;virginity.&quot; Teens engaging in oral sex are likely to initiate vaginal sex soon after; in a prospective study, 50 percent of high school <span class=\"nowrap\">freshmen/sophomores</span> who initiated oral sex at the end of ninth grade self-reported engaging in vaginal sex within the next two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Studies evaluating teen sexual behaviors are fraught with problems regarding reliability and consistency of reported behaviors, definitions and understanding of specific behaviors, difficulties in measuring activities, and the impact of these activities on their current and future lives.

In addition, adolescent mothers are more likely to drop out of school, face unemployment, live in poverty, and rely on public assistance than are their peers who do not have children.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers adolescents a special population in their regular review of STI care in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Infections with human papillomavirus, <em>Chlamydia</em>, and gonorrhea have the highest rates in teens and young adults. Multiple aspects of adolescence contribute to this increased risk including: early sexual debut, multiple sexual partners, sequential sexual partnerships of limited duration, inconsistent condom use, increased biologic susceptibility to infection, and difficulties accessing health care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Youth at highest risk for STIs include those in juvenile detention facilities, young men having sex with men, and youth using injection drugs.</p><p>In the United States, all 50 states and the District of Columbia explicitly protect minors' rights to confidential services and care for STIs. Despite these protections and the high rates of STIs in this age group, many providers fail to routinely assess STI risks, provide harm reduction counseling, and screen for asymptomatic infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. Screening for STIs is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for sexually transmitted infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>STI prevention counseling should be developmentally appropriate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F85699\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85699 \">table 2</a>) and provide anticipatory education and guidance, with a goal of risk avoidance and harm reduction. Open-ended questions and nonjudgmental counseling is important for adolescents who may not fully report all risks and sexual behaviors. Because early age of first intercourse is a risk factor for pregnancy and STI acquisition, it is appropriate to support abstinence and delaying sexual debut. For those who choose to be sexually active, consistent and correct use of condoms is the most effective strategy to prevent STIs. When recommending condoms, it is important for providers to demonstrate appropriate techniques for condom use and to model effective communication and partner negotiation skills. These goals (abstinence or consistent use of condoms) may be difficult to achieve for adolescents who feel invulnerable and who may lack cognitive risk-consequence decision-making abilities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45216050\"><span class=\"h2\">Victimization</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45216087\"><span class=\"h3\">Teen dating violence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Teen dating violence (TDV), including psychologic, physical, and sexual aggression, is common in adolescent dating relationships, with rates highest in young women ages 16 to 20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Adolescent males and females report perpetration and victimization from violence equally.

Medical providers who do not routinely screen for TDV in adolescents miss opportunities for education and intervention.

Teens who identify as having partners of both sexes seem to be at highest risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Chronic victimization has additional effects because young men having sex with men who have been repeatedly victimized are less likely to request that their partners use a condom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

Assuming that risks and outcomes are more related to gender of partners than to social support for sexual minorities, quality of sexual experience, and self-esteem may do a significant disservice to youth. By promoting sexuality as normative, healthy, respectful, and meaningful in the global context of adolescent development, providers can encourage a positive model of empowerment, strength, and resiliency for all youth exploring their gender and sexual identities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">HEALTH CARE PROVIDER ISSUES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Sex education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Education and interventions that promote responsible and healthy sexuality can and should be delivered in homes, schools, medical, and community settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Despite a movement to provide abstinence-only education, evidence continues to demonstrate that abstinence-only programs do not work, that comprehensive sexuality education programs can improve knowledge and reduce risk behaviors, and that the public and parents support comprehensive programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/63-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-68</a>].

There is copious evidence demonstrating that comprehensive sexual education delays intercourse, reduces frequency of intercourse, reduces the number of sexual partners, and increases the use of condoms and other contraceptives after sexual debut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>School-based interventions have been the traditional source of mass sexual health education efforts. The most effective programs have common characteristics: clear health goals (sexually transmitted infection <span class=\"nowrap\">[STI]/human</span> immunodeficiency virus [HIV] prevention or pregnancy prevention), explicit linking of behavior to goals (abstinence, condom use), and strategies to improve sexual decision making and behaviors (knowledge, attitudes, values, perception of risk, community norms, self-efficacy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Teens, however, report that their education about sexual health comes from a variety of sources. Sex education from parents, grandparents, and religious leaders has been associated with beliefs linked to delaying sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. In a meta-analysis of observational studies, parental monitoring was associated with delayed sexual intercourse, greater condom use, and increased contraceptive use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

The focus on abstinence-only education has led to the media serving as a leading sex &quot;educator&quot; in the United States today [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>], especially for younger sexually inexperienced teens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p>With the importance of media and technology in youth culture, it is important for newer frameworks of health education to consider alternative electronic routes such as interactive computer modules, text messaging, and other social media networks as well as school-based lecture style interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/81-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">81-84</a>]. As often as STIs and early pregnancy have been studied in youth populations, there are still many opportunities to learn more about health promotion and harm reduction in some of the highest risk youth, including those who are incarcerated, have mental illness, trade sex for resources, or are HIV-positive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Barriers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although sexuality is a universal component of human experience and adolescence is a time of significant exploration and decision making regarding gender roles and sexual health, many providers fail to discuss or miss opportunities to discuss these topics with adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/30,55,85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,55,85,86</a>].</p><p>Barriers to discussions of sexuality include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinic and service accessibility (hours of operation, transportation, insurance, billing, or self-pay costs)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of or perceived lack of confidentiality</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mandatory parental consent laws or practices related to contraception, STIs, etc (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Confidentiality in adolescent health care&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of communication coordination among and between health programs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Narrowed, personally biased conception of sexual health care and lack of evidence-based information negatively impacting clinician anticipatory guidance and prevention efforts</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provider- or system-level political, religious, and ethical beliefs and biases</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stigma and discomfort associated with various aspects of sexuality including specific sexual behaviors, gender and sexual variance, and early sexual activity</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Practical and financial constraints of clinic time and resources</p><p/><p>Many health care providers miss opportunities to discuss gender and sexual health issues. Abstinence, condom use, and STI prevention are routinely discussed in over one-half of anticipatory guidance visits. However, this is well below the recommendation for universal annual screening and education. Screening and counseling in regards to sexual orientation, gender identity, and a complete range of contraceptive options for adolescents is markedly below national goals and recommended standards of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/55,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,85</a>]. Providers who are uncomfortable or unable to provide comprehensive adolescent sexual health care may consider referring their patients to a provider who specializes in adolescent medicine. Comprehensive sexual health education and support can be complex and time consuming, necessitating referral to additional resources.</p><p>Despite continued efforts to improve anticipatory guidance and sex education in pediatric health care settings, a 2014 study revealed continued missed opportunities for sexual health counseling in adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. In this study, analysis of audio-recorded conversations between adolescents and their clinicians revealed that 35 percent of clinicians did not discuss sexuality with their patients, 30 percent spent &lt;36 seconds discussing sexuality, and 35 percent spent &ge;36 seconds discussing sexuality. Patient characteristics associated with longer conversations included being older, female, African American, and more participation during the visit. In another study, having private time with clinicians, completion of pre-visit screening, the perception that the visit offered benefit, and visits lasting more than 10 minutes were associated with improved recall of anticipatory guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. These factors may be used to improve promotion of healthy sexuality at adolescent visits. There is little to no data regarding pediatric providers' efforts to prepare youth for the changes of puberty or screening for gender development and gender nonconformity, suggesting that anticipatory discussions regarding upcoming biologic and psychosocial changes of adolescence also are neglected.</p><p>In a 2014 survey, many urban disadvantaged youth reported mistrust of physicians, fear and lack of time as barriers to accessing care, and most felt that sexual care was more difficult to access than general health care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Principles of care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Health care providers play an important role for youth in discussions of adolescent health and sexuality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F85699\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85699 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/26,30,89-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,30,89-91</a>]. Many adolescents consider their provider to be the most valued and trusted source of advice about issues of health and sexuality. Medical providers are particularly important facilitators of sexual health discussions as many youth indicate that they &quot;definitely would not&quot; talk to parents, citing &quot;embarrassment&quot; as the main reason to avoid discussion, with least communication occurring between fathers and daughters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p>Clinicians who provide adolescent sexual health care often use interview techniques and care paradigms that include motivational interviewing, harm reduction, and social marketing in order to create an open dialogue that invites honest answers, focuses on individual strengths and goals, builds skills, and promotes personal responsibility. Use of the following principles to guide discussions of adolescent sexuality facilitates promotion of individual strengths and responsibility while reducing potentially negative consequences:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confidentiality</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normalization</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respect</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid assumptions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific questioning</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Listen to responses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid medical jargon</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Help the adolescent recognize the links between sexual risk taking and other aspects of their lives</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Think about prevention</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Know community resources</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Confidentiality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assuring confidentiality is the first step in establishing basic trust and respect between the medical provider and the adolescent patient. Most adolescents require absolute privacy to talk candidly about their sexuality. Always ask partners, friends, or parents to leave the examination room at some point during the visit and before beginning these discussions. The importance of confidentiality in caring for adolescent patients, particularly surrounding issues of sexuality, cannot be overemphasized. This is especially true for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQQ) youth who may fear lack of sensitive or appropriate care as well as being inadvertently &quot;outed&quot; by their health care provider to parents or peers, an event that can have a significant effect on the sexual minority youth's family relationships, social status, and personal safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Concerns about confidentiality are cited frequently as a reason to avoid seeking health care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Confidentiality in adolescent health care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Before initiating a discussion about confidentiality, health care providers must be careful to understand both state and institutional boundaries surrounding this issue, particularly with respect to treating adolescents without parental consent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Confidentiality in adolescent health care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=consent-in-adolescent-health-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Consent in adolescent health care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Normalization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because many adolescents do not have experience in answering questions of a sexual nature, the role of the clinician is to normalize discussions of sex. In order to do so, clinicians must be comfortable asking questions about sexuality and sexual behavior themselves. If health care providers appear uncomfortable asking questions about condom use or sexual orientation, the adolescent patient certainly will not feel comfortable answering them. It is important for health care providers to develop a communication style that enables them to ask the questions and get the answers they need to provide patients with appropriate health care, education, support, and referral. The discussion should take place when the patient is dressed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Respect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Health care facilities and individual providers must have respect for the diversity and differences inherent in adolescents and young adults, including gender, <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity,</span> sexual orientation, and physical appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/91,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,93</a>].

In particular, health care providers should <strong>not</strong> assume:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>That all patients are heterosexual unless told otherwise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-sexuality/abstract/28,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,94</a>]. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth exist in all communities and in all pediatric practices; health care providers should ask adolescents questions that are gender and sexuality neutral. Avoid terms such as &quot;boyfriend&quot; or &quot;girlfriend&quot; but instead ask about &quot;crushes&quot; or &quot;romantic or sexual partners,&quot; directly asking if patients are attracted to males, females, both, or neither. Open-ended questions and gender-neutral questions allow the adolescent to reveal the gender of their partners and begin a conversation about sexual identity and sexual behaviors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>That males who self-identify as heterosexual do not also have same-gender sexual partners.

Providers should ask specifically what is meant by &quot;safer sex,&quot; because their definition of this term may be different from what is thought by the adolescent.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Specific questioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important for health care providers to ask specific questions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95293\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95293 \">table 3</a>). Questions such as, &quot;Are you sexually active?&quot; are closed-ended, vague, and open to multiple interpretations with regard to both time frame and type of sexual behavior. Some adolescents who engage in oral or anal sex may not consider themselves &quot;sexually active&quot; and, as such, may not be aware of the health risks associated with this behavior. Because health consequences resulting from sexual activity have more to do with sexual behavior than sexual orientation, questions should focus on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Specific sexual behaviors</strong>, including digital, oral, vaginal, and anal intercourse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95293\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95293 \">table 3</a>). These questions should include information regarding date of last sexual activity and last sexual activity without a condom and without hormonal birth control. Detailed and specific information about behaviors and partners is important in determining risks and strengths. Sexual debut and lifetime, as well as recent numbers of partners, can be helpful components of a sexual risk assessment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is important to establish the context for these questions so that the adolescent does not feel judged. The questions can be introduced with a statement like: &quot;I am going to ask you about intimate and personal details of your sexual behaviors, partners, and other activities so I can know what to suggest for screening, testing, and healthy sex decisions.&quot; Such an introduction lets the adolescent know that all topics are open for discussion &ndash; and may open the door to other disclosures as well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Condom use</strong>, including how often and with whom. Separating condom use for STI prevention from condom use for contraception or family planning can be conceptually helpful and promotes use of dual methods for safer sex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Contraception</strong>, for themselves or their partner. Questions about current use, problems with prior methods including difficulties with adherence or continuation, fears or concerns about side effects, and interest in other methods can generate useful discussion about contraceptive options. Asking directly about their immediate and long-term family planning goals, including ambivalence about pregnancy, can provide additional useful information (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F85698\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85698 \">table 4</a>). Including young heterosexual males in the screening and education process adds to their ability to contribute to family planning decisions.

Teens can be disconcerted and &quot;turned off&quot; to open and honest discussion of important sexual health issues if providers are perceived as either too busy, or worse, not interested. Providers who plan on providing adolescent sexual health services must plan to incorporate additional time and attention needed for sensitive and responsive screening and counseling. In addition, providers must pay attention to both verbal and nonverbal cues. Body language can be quite informative in interviews with adolescent patients, and an astute clinician might recognize opportunities for more in-depth questioning or targeted risk-prevention education.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Avoid medical jargon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important for health care providers to speak about sexuality and sexual behavior in terms that are professional yet familiar and comfortable for the adolescent and avoid using medical jargon. As an example, questions about fellatio or cunnilingus may be replaced with more colloquial terms, such as &quot;oral sex.&quot; For young men having sex with men, questions about anal insertive or anal receptive sex may be replaced with more familiar terms, such as &quot;top&quot; or &quot;bottom,&quot; respectively. Developmentally appropriate terminology and focus is important for the early or developmentally delayed adolescent. Invariably, in discussions of sexuality, adolescents will use terminology or phrases that are not understood easily by the health care provider. In these cases, one should ask for clarification by stating, &quot;I am not familiar with that term. Can you tell me what you mean?&quot; Adolescents usually welcome the opportunity to talk about themselves and may see this request as an expression of interest on the part of the provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Recognize the links</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When talking with young people about sexuality and safer sex, an important factor is to help patients make connections between their sexual risk taking and other aspects of their lives. As an example, many youth engage in unsafe sexual practices while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Helping an adolescent recognize this link is an important step in devising a comprehensive risk-reduction strategy that incorporates both substance-use services and safer sex practices. Other &quot;links&quot; include domestic violence, exchanging sex for money or drugs, and sexual assault. Each of these matters represents an opportunity for counseling, support, and referral.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Think prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Young people have a lot of questions about their bodies and sexuality and have few safe, confidential spaces in which to ask about them. Whether it is a visit for a sore throat, abdominal pain, or yearly anticipatory guidance, each interaction can be seen by the health care provider as an opportunity for discussing health promotion and disease prevention. Just as providers discuss the importance of exercise or seat belts, or the health benefits of quitting smoking, they should provide sexuality education at every opportunity. It is important that disease prevention and contraception, including both condoms and hormonal methods, be readily available. No evidence suggests that the availability of contraception makes adolescents sexually active at younger ages than they would have been otherwise. Introducing sexuality in developmentally appropriate ways and while it is still relatively hypothetical is often welcomed by parents. Providers can model how to open discussions regarding sensitive topics as well as how to engage and counsel regarding safer sexual decision making.</p><p>As an example: &quot;Well Sam, I am glad you and your dad are here together. During these adolescent health visits, we typically do some education about sexual health. Have you and your dad had any talks about puberty, dating, or sex? What have you and your dad talked about? It can be really hard for parents to think about their child having sex; just like it can be hard for teenagers to talk to their parents specifically about sex. It can be more comfortable to talk about sexuality and sexual health before there are any significant concerns. It is also really important to talk about sexual health and safety to prevent problems, diseases, unintended pregnancy, and unhealthy relationships.</p><p>&quot;Let's talk about some common questions or concerns that people your age and a little older might have about sexual health. What is important for you (directed to the parent) to communicate about sex with your teen? From my perspective, it is important to discuss ways to enter into relationships safely and when you (directed to the teen) are ready for this. Picking a respectful and loving partner who listens to you and respects your limits is also important. We also want to make sure <span class=\"nowrap\">you/your</span> teen knows about how to avoid or prevent sexually transmitted infections. We want both boy and girl patients to consider ways to plan and prevent unintended pregnancy until they are ready to parent and raise a family.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Know community resources</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adolescents may require or desire educational resources or other youth services that are beyond the scope of the individual practice setting. This need is particularly true for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and gender-nonconforming youth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-minority-youth-primary-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual minority youth: Primary care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of gender nonconformity in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is important to know what resources exist for youth in your community <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> state. In addition, a variety of internet sites are available to provide relevant information and education on adolescent sexuality issues.

Sexuality, sexual behaviors, and sexual relationships are an important and necessary part of human development. &quot;Responsible sexual behavior&quot; (eg, delaying initiation of sexual intercourse, choosing caring and respectful partners, increasing the use of condoms, and using effective contraception) is an important public health issue. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adolescent development is frequently divided into three stages based loosely on chronologic age and level of functioning: early, middle, and late adolescence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79899\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79899 \">table 1</a>). One of the tasks for healthy adolescent development is the acquisition of a mature and responsible sexuality including both an expression of sexual behaviors and the capacity for meaningful intimate relationships. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Adolescent development'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Health care providers are a valued and trusted source of information and advice about adolescent health and sexuality. It is important for them to take advantage of opportunities to discuss sexual behavior, particularly as it pertains to the prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F85699\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85699 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Health care provider issues'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Health issues and outcomes related to sexuality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When discussing sexuality and sexual behavior with adolescents, it is important to create an open dialogue that invites honest answers, focuses on individual strengths and goals, builds skills, and promotes personal responsibility, while reducing the risk of potentially negative consequences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95293\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95293 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F85698\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85698 \">table 4</a>).
