Operating on obese patients is challenging because of anatomic and physiologic characteristics and comorbidities of obese patients. However, the risk of serious intraoperative and in-hospital complications and mortality rates are relatively low when the surgery is performed by experienced surgeons with an institutional investment in bariatric programs. </p><p>Adverse intraoperative events (AIE) are a risk factor for serious postoperative complications (eg, pulmonary embolus, myocardial infarction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operations-perioperative-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In addition, postoperative complication rates vary with surgical approach, such as fewer complications with the laparoscopic approach than the open approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operations-perioperative-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Complications also vary based upon type of procedure, such as fewer complications with the adjustable gastric band (AGB) than the laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operations-perioperative-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. </p><p>This topic will review the major perioperative (intraoperative and in-hospital postoperative) complications and mortality rates of the more common bariatric surgical procedures, including laparoscopic and open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS).</p><p>A description of bariatric procedures, indications and preoperative management, short-time medical outcomes, and long-term complications of laparoscopic operations are reviewed as separate topics.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric procedures for the management of severe obesity: Descriptions&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-operations-for-management-of-obesity-indications-and-preoperative-preparation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric operations for management of obesity: Indications and preoperative preparation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical outcomes following bariatric surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric operative procedures: Thirty-day morbidity and mortality&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Late complications of bariatric surgical operations&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of laparoscopic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1929454\"><span class=\"h1\">OPERATIVE CHALLENGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Operating on the obese individual can be technically challenging even for the most experienced anesthesia and surgical teams.

The risk of a difficult direct laryngoscopy is six times higher than that of the nonobese general population and is proportional to the larger circumference of the neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operations-perioperative-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]. Other physical attributes that increase the difficulty of airway management include limited flexion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extension of the cervical spine, restricted mouth opening, and redundant oral tissue.

For example, based upon retrospective reviews of two large bariatric surgery databases, the Bariatric Outcomes Longitudinal Database (BOLD) that includes information on 78,951 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operations-perioperative-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) database that included 5882 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operations-perioperative-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], the overall rate of adverse intraoperative events was 0.69 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively. However, when specific procedures from the LABS database were evaluated, the AIE was 7.3 percent for open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (ORYGB) operations, 5.5 percent for laparoscopic RYGB (LRYGB) operations, and 3.0 percent for laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operations-perioperative-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The sleeve gastrectomy (SG) appears to be somewhere between the LRYGB and LAGB in terms of efficacy and safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operations-perioperative-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>In addition, an AIE, along with conversion from a laparoscopic to an open procedure, increase the risk for serious postoperative complications (eg, pulmonary embolus, myocardial infarction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operations-perioperative-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>] &#160; Patients who experience an adverse intraoperative event are more than twice as likely to develop a major postoperative complication compared with patients without an adverse event (8.8 versus 3.9 percent, p&lt;0.001).

Based upon 17 randomized trials that included 3040 patients, there was no statistical difference in the rates of major complications (eg, vascular or solid organ injury) for open or closed (Veress needle, standard or optical trocar) laparoscopic entry techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operations-perioperative-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Many bariatric surgeons prefer a combined approach. They first obtain a pneumoperitoneum using the Veress needle technique then place a port using an optical view method. Access techniques and access-related complications for laparoscopic procedures are reviewed separately.

Some injuries can be life-threatening. When using the Veress needle technique in obese patients, the left upper quadrant is preferred for initial placement (Palmer's Point). The aspiration test, the saline drop test, and an opening pressure of less than 10 mmHg should all be used to confirm proper placement of the needle. When using the Hassan technique for patients with a large amount of subcutaneous fat, the incision should be made large enough to identify the abdominal wall fascia and peritoneum. The area beneath the Veress needle insertion site inside the abdomen should be inspected for injuries during the initial laparoscopic evaluation of the abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operations-perioperative-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. </p><p>Bowel injury, such as a puncture or laceration, can occur with insertion of a Veress needle, trocar, lysis of adhesions, or dissection.
