Membranous vessels can also arise as aberrant branches of a marginally inserted umbilical cord or they can connect lobes of a bilobed placenta or the placenta and a succenturiate lobe. Because of the lack of protection from Wharton&rsquo;s jelly, these vessels are prone to compression and rupture, especially when they are located in the membranes covering the cervical os (ie, vasa previa).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">VELAMENTOUS UMBILICAL CORD</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a velamentous umbilical cord insertion, the placental end of the cord consists of divergent umbilical vessels surrounded only by fetal membranes, with no Wharton's jelly. The length of the membranous vessels, ie, the distance between the end of the normal cord and the placental insertion, is highly variable. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1794911\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Velamentous insertion occurs in approximately 1 percent of singleton gestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], but is observed in as many as 15 percent of monochorionic twin gestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. It is also more common in placenta previa than in normally located placentas. The prevalence may be slightly higher in stillbirths, particularly from multifetal pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1794976\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of velamentous cord insertion is unknown. The most popular hypothesis is that the cord is initially inserted centrally, but its location progressively becomes peripheral as one half of the placenta actively proliferates toward the well-vascularized uterine fundus (trophotropism) while the other pole involutes; the umbilical cord is unable to follow the migration of the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The association of velamentous cord insertion and placenta previa supports this hypothesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1794870\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1794996\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound and gross examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On ultrasound and gross examination, the normal umbilical cord sheath is contiguous with the chorionic plate. With a velamentous insertion, the cord can end several centimeters from the placenta, at which point the umbilical vessels separate from each other and cross between the amnion and chorion before connecting to the subchorionic vessels of the placenta (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50561%7EOBGYN%2F63304%7EOBGYN%2F76136\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50561 graphicRef63304 graphicRef76136 \">picture 1A-C</a>). This typically occurs at the margin of the placenta (within 1 cm of the placental edge), but can also occur at the apex of the gestational sac. In monochorionic twins, the velamentous vessels often occur in the dividing membranes. </p><p>On ultrasound examination, the umbilical vessels often lie parallel to the uterine wall as they enter the placental margin and connect to the subchorionic vasculature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81763\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81763 \">image 1</a>). They remain immobile when the uterus is shaken by the ultrasonographer; in contrast, a loop of umbilical cord will move when the uterus is shaken [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Color Doppler imaging enhances identification of the vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60270\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60270 \">image 2</a>). </p><p>Velamentous cords contain a single umbilical artery in about 12 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1795143\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the vessels are attached to the chorion, rupture of the fetal membranes may rupture the vessels, which can result in fetal exsanguination and death within minutes. This typically occurs when the membranous vessels are close to or cover the cervix; rarely, membranous vessels have ruptured in the absence of documented membrane rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Vasa previa'</a> below.)</p><p>The membranous vessels are also at risk of kinking and compression. Membranous vessels with longer lengths are more prone to kinking, while descent of the fetal presenting part increases the risk of compression when the membranous vessels are close to or cover the cervix. The subsequent reduction in blood flow can result in fetal heart rate abnormalities, and, if the reduction in blood flow is persistent or severe, fetal death may occur. Kinking and compression can also induce thrombosis of the vessels, which has been associated with placental infarction, amputation of fetal limbs or digits, and neonatal purpura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p>In a 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis that evaluated the association between placental implantation abnormalities and risk of preterm delivery in singleton gestations, velamentous cord insertions were associated with a high preterm delivery rate (37.5 percent) and increased perinatal risks, such as neonatal intensive care unit admissions, small for gestational age, and perinatal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The majority of included studies were descriptive, did not have a control group, and had small numbers of cases. However, subsequent larger studies have also reported an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes, including death, although the absolute risk for these outcomes was low and was also low in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>When only monochorionic twin pregnancies are examined, velamentous cord insertion site has been associated with discordant growth and intrauterine growth restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/3,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14</a>]. </p><p>The mother is also at risk for complications. A population-based series including over 11,000 pregnancies with velamentous cord insertion noted 5.5 percent underwent manual removal of the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prenatal diagnosis of velamentous insertion is based upon the presence of characteristic sonographic findings (membranous umbilical vessels) at the placental cord insertion site. When color Doppler is used to enhance identification of the vessels, diagnostic sensitivities of 69 to 100 percent and specificities of 95 to 100 percent have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/1,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16</a>].</p><p>A definitive diagnosis is made by gross examination of the placenta, cord, and membranes after delivery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50561%7EOBGYN%2F63304%7EOBGYN%2F76136\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50561 graphicRef63304 graphicRef76136 \">picture 1A-C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1794996\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound and gross examination'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8324756\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American College of Radiology (ACR), the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guideline for performance of obstetric ultrasound does not specifically recommend evaluation of the placental insertion site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The guideline recommends that &ldquo;the umbilical cord should be imaged, and the number of vessels in the cord should be evaluated when possible&rdquo; with evaluation of the &ldquo;umbilical cord insertion site into the fetal abdomen.&rdquo;</p><p>Most experts do not recommend routine screening for velamentous insertion, as it is costly in low risk patients with no proven benefit while increasing anxiety and possibly unnecessary antepartum testing and intervention. However, some authors have opined that every second trimester ultrasound examination or every second trimester ultrasound in monochorionic twin pregnancies should evaluate the placental cord insertion. Even when this is done, the diagnosis of velamentous insertion may not be made in the prenatal period, and failure to make this diagnosis is not a breach of the standard of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no data from large or controlled studies on which to base management recommendations. There is no evidence that interventions such as late preterm induction of labor or scheduled cesarean delivery improve outcome. In our opinion, these pregnancies can be allowed to labor spontaneously and deliver vaginally, in the absence of additional pregnancy complications necessitating a different approach. However, we do not allow these pregnancies to continue beyond 40 weeks of gestation since decreasing amniotic fluid volume postterm may place the membranous vessels at increased risk of compression. </p><p>Given the risks described above, if ultrasound examination suggests the presence of a velamentous umbilical cord, we suggest the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detailed fetal anatomic survey, including evaluation for coexistent vasa previa</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serial assessment of fetal growth, every four to six weeks</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal heart rate tracings weekly, beginning at 36 weeks of gestation, to look for recurrent variable decelerations from kinking or compression</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Counseling patients to call their providers as soon as labor begins</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delivery by 40 weeks of gestation</p><p/><p>We monitor the fetal heart rate continuously intrapartum to identify signs of severe cord compression or vessel rupture. After delivery of the infant, no or very gentle traction should be placed on the umbilical cord to avoid avulsion, which could result in a retained placenta.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">VASA PREVIA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In vasa previa, fetal blood vessels are present in the membranes covering the internal cervical os. The membranous vessels may be associated with a velamentous umbilical cord (type 1 vasa previa) or they may connect the lobes of a bilobed placenta or the placenta and a succenturiate lobe (type 2 vasa previa) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Aberrant blood vessels within 2 cm of the internal os have similar implications to those actually covering the internal os [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. While there is a conventional threshold of 2 cm from the internal os to the vessel used to define vasa previa, the exact distance presenting an increased risk has not been determined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of vasa previa is approximately 1 in 2500 deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24</a>], but is much higher in pregnancies conceived following use of assisted reproductive technologies (prevalence as high as 1 in 202) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. The prevalence is also increased in second-trimester low-lying placentas or placenta previa (even if resolved), bilobed or succenturiate lobe placentas in the lower uterine segment, and multiple gestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/27,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pathogenesis is unknown, but is likely similar to that for velamentous cord insertion. Resolution of placenta previa or low-lying placenta may result in type I vasa previa. (See <a href=\"#H1794976\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37723942\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for vasa previa are not independent and include velamentous cord insertion, umbilical cord insertion in the lower part of the uterus at first-trimester ultrasound, placenta previa or low-lying placenta on second-trimester ultrasound scan, succenturiate placental lobe or bilobed placenta, in vitro fertilization, and multiple gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. The placental location and the relationship between the placenta and internal cervical os should be evaluated carefully in these patients. </p><p>A systematic review of predictive indicators of vasa previa found at least 83 percent of cases had one or more risk indicators, most commonly placenta previa, assisted conception, velamentous cord insertion, and bilobed placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15677242\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15678079\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On ultrasound examination, vasa previa appears as a linear sonolucent area that passes over the internal os. Color Doppler flow mapping showing umbilical artery or vein waveforms confirms that the sonolucency is a blood vessel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72943\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72943 \">image 3</a>). </p><p>In one review, the placenta was a previa, low-lying, bilobed, or succenturiate in about 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In a retrospective single center study, the cord insertion was velamentous or marginal or the placenta was a previa or low lying in 95 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. If the placenta is a previa or low lying, the umbilical cord insertion site is velamentous.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15678178\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, pulsating vessels in the membranes overlying the cervical os are palpable on digital examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15678086\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suspected second trimester vasa previa may resolve over time. In one series, 3 of 18 cases resolved by the late third trimester and had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery; diagnosis was based on aberrant vessels over the internal os [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In a second series, 5 of 21 cases diagnosed in the second trimester resolved, while none of 8 cases diagnosed in the third trimester resolved; vasa previa was defined as a fetal vessel within 2 cm of the internal cervical os on transvaginal sonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In a third series, 5 of 56 cases resolved by delivery and were considered false positive diagnoses due to a loop of cord or dilated maternal vessels in the lower uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15678135\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>More commonly, the vasa previa persists and is at risk for rupture upon spontaneous or artificial rupture of the membranes; rarely, fetal bleeding occurs without membrane rupture. In most cases, bleeding rapidly results in hypotension, leading to fetal heart rate abnormalities, such as a sinusoidal pattern; fetal death due to exsanguination can occur within minutes. In two series, 50 to 60 percent of pregnancies were delivered electively, and the remainder were delivered emergently primarily because of contractions or labor, bleeding, nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing, or other (eg, asymptomatic cervical shortening, preeclampsia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/21,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,35</a>]. In one of these series, the likelihood of delivery in the next week increased substantially at 34 to 35 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Perinatal mortality rates are low (less than 10 percent) with antepartum diagnosis and appropriate management, and obviously higher among pregnancies diagnosed intrapartum or postpartum as a result of fetal complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/32,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,36</a>]. In monochorionic twin gestations, the perinatal mortality rate is high for both twins, even if the vasa previa is associated with only one twin, due to the presence of placental vascular anastomoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>As with velamentous cord insertion, the membranous vessels are at risk of compression from the fetal presenting part since they are not protected by the structure of a normal umbilical cord. Compression could lead to fetal asphyxia.</p><p>In one study, type 1 vasa previa was associated with lower mean birth weight than type 2 vasa previa (2494 versus 3037 grams), and lower placental weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The authors hypothesized that growth inhibition was due to a combination of a primary placental developmental disorder and alterations of the umbilical circulation in the velamentous cord.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15678568\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pathological examination may reveal membranous vessels, but otherwise is not useful since the pathologist cannot determine the location of the placenta and cord in the uterus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal diagnosis of vasa previa is based on identification of membranous fetal vessels passing across or in close proximity to the internal cervical os by real-time transvaginal ultrasound examination with color Doppler (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72943\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72943 \">image 3</a>) (see <a href=\"#H15678079\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above). Close proximity has been defined as within 2 cm of the internal os; however, only limited data are available to support this specific measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In prospective studies in which the investigators were specifically looking for vasa previa, sonography plus color Doppler had high diagnostic sensitivity: <span class=\"nowrap\">10/10</span> cases after 26 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] and <span class=\"nowrap\">1/1</span> case at 18 to 20 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]; in each study, one additional case diagnosed prenatally could not be confirmed at delivery. In a systematic review including both prospective and retrospective studies, sensitivity ranged from 53 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to clarify the ultrasound diagnosis if there is diagnostic uncertainty and confirmation will affect pregnancy management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/23,41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,41-43</a>].</p><p>Several case reports have described use of three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound technology for the diagnosis of vasa previa and to determine the optimum site for hysterotomy at delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>]. Although technically feasible, use of 3D technology has not been proven superior to two-dimensional (2D) technology, as arterial and venous color flow mapping can be easily performed with 2D technology alone. In addition, 3D technology is not universally available. </p><p>In the absence of prenatal sonographic diagnosis, a clinical diagnosis of vasa previa should be suspected in the setting of vaginal bleeding that occurs upon rupture of the membranes and is accompanied by fetal heart rate abnormalities, particularly a sinusoidal pattern or bradycardia. Confirmation that the blood is fetal via Apt, Kleihauer-Betke tests, or other tests (Ogita, Londersloot) supports the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]; however, there is usually no time to wait for test results before performing an emergency cesarean delivery for fetal distress.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15678135\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15678143\"><span class=\"h3\">Funic presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A loop of umbilical cord lying over the cervical os can be mistaken for vasa previa. In contrast to vasa previa, the umbilical vessels in funic presentation are surrounded by Wharton&rsquo;s jelly and can float away from the cervical os if the uterus is shaken or the patient is placed in knee-chest or Trendelenburg position. We suggest using the abdominal hand to push the presenting part cephalad in an attempt to better visualize the area of the internal os when the presenting part is engaged.

A definitive diagnosis of velamentous cord insertion is made by pathologic examination of the placenta, cord, and membranes after delivery. (See <a href=\"#H1794996\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound and gross examination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vessels in a velamentous umbilical cord are at increased risk of compression compared to a normal cord. We suggest fetal heart rate monitoring to detect compression of cord vessels beginning at 36 weeks of gestation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no evidence that induction of labor or scheduled cesarean delivery improve the outcome of pregnancies complicated by velamentous cord insertion without vasa previa. We continuously monitor the fetal heart rate during labor and exercise caution when exerting traction on the umbilical cord after birth. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p><strong>Vasa previa: </strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prenatal diagnosis of vasa previa is based upon characteristic sonographic findings (membranous vessels that cross the internal cervical os). In the absence of prenatal sonographic diagnosis, a clinical diagnosis of vasa previa should be suspected in the setting of vaginal bleeding that occurs upon rupture of the membranes and is accompanied by fetal heart rate abnormalities, particularly a sinusoidal pattern or bradycardia. Fetal exsanguination can occur within minutes. (See <a href=\"#H15678079\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15678086\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for vasa previa are not independent and include velamentous cord insertion, umbilical cord insertion in the lower part of the uterus at first-trimester ultrasound, placenta previa or low-lying placenta on second-trimester ultrasound scan, succenturiate placental lobe or bilobed placenta, in vitro fertilization, and multiple gestation. The placental location and the relationship between the placenta and internal cervical os should be evaluated carefully in these patients. (See <a href=\"#H37723942\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with placenta previa (even if resolved) or a low lying placenta on midtrimester ultrasound examination should undergo transvaginal ultrasound with color and pulsed Doppler at 32 weeks of gestation to screen for vasa previa. (See <a href=\"#H8324756\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency and severity of cord compression may be higher for vasa previa than velamentous umbilical cord (without vasa previa); therefore, we monitor pregnancies with vasa previa more closely. We suggest administration of a course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> at 28 to 32 weeks, weekly nonstress testing beginning at 32 weeks in outpatients, with hospitalization at 30 to 34 weeks of gestation for more frequent monitoring to detect early evidence of cord compression. Hospitalization also facilitates the ability to perform an emergency cesarean delivery in the event of premature rupture of membranes or preterm labor. (See <a href=\"#H907698675\" class=\"local\">'Antepartum'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pregnancies with vasa previa, we suggest scheduled delivery at 34 to 35 weeks of gestation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
