As a result, patients with MDS are at risk for symptomatic anemia, infection, and bleeding, as well as progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is often refractory to standard treatment.</p><p>Most patients with MDS die because of the consequences of bone marrow failure, rather than transformation to AML. Thus, use of such terms as &quot;pre-leukemia&quot; or &quot;smoldering leukemia&quot; can be misleading, if taken to imply that death or morbidity from MDS results only when AML develops. Indeed, the distinction between MDS and AML is itself arbitrary, as patients with 20 to 30 percent blasts in the marrow were considered to have MDS by French-American-British (FAB) criteria, but AML by the World Health Organization (WHO). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes#H64020408\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Acute myeloid leukemia'</a>.)</p><p>The natural history of patients with MDS is varied. This heterogeneity reflects both known and unknown differences in the pathobiology of specific subtypes within MDS and patient related characteristics, such as age and prior exposure to chemotherapy. While the pathologic classification systems (eg, French American British classification system and WHO classification system) have been valuable as benchmarks for diagnosis, they have been less useful for the determination of prognosis. As a result, further dissection of these classification schemes has been performed, taking into account variables such as age and sex, morphologic features, blast percentage, clinical characteristics, the presence of cytopenias, transfusion requirements, and cytogenetic abnormalities.</p><p>There are three main prognostic systems that have been developed and validated in patients with MDS: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>International prognostic scoring system (IPSS) and a revised IPSS (IPSS-R)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>WHO prognostic scoring system (WPSS)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) MDS model</p><p/><p>The IPSS is the simplest and most commonly used. However, each system has strengths and limitations, which will be reviewed. Of importance, all prognostic systems probably explain only a minority of variability in outcome. Observation of the disease course without therapy can provide useful information regarding an individual&rsquo;s disease tempo and prognosis, especially for asymptomatic patients with apparently low risk disease by the prognostic scores described above.

However, there are several potential limitations when applying the IPSS, many of which were addressed by the IPSS-R [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes-in-adults/abstract/11,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17-20</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survival is dated from the time of presentation to a &quot;tertiary&quot; center, although the diagnosis may have been established some time before.

While outcomes might be different now that a variety of interventions are widely available, an analysis of a separate population suggested that the predictive value of the IPSS-R also applies to those treated with disease modifying agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azacitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azacitidine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes-in-adults/abstract/13,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,25,26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both the IPSS and IPSS-R only consider patients with de novo MDS, that is, patients who have not previously received chemotherapy.

As a consequence, it refined prognoses in patients with IPSS scores of low or intermediate-1, while the IPSS did not do the same in patients scored using the MDACC system. Another strength is that the patient population used to develop the MDACC model also included patients not considered in the IPSS, namely those with secondary MDS and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) with leukocytosis, although apparently these entities had little prognostic effect as they were not included in the MDACC model.</p><p>The MDACC model should only be applied to the population of patients with lower risk (low or intermediate-1 IPSS) MDS from which it was derived. Patients used to develop this model received a variety of treatments and these may have influenced prognosis. In contrast, patients used to develop the IPSS were essentially untreated until they developed AML. Finally, the MDACC model, even with an online calculator, appears more cumbersome to use than the IPSS.</p><p>It is important to note that, despite very strong associations between the factors identified in all these models and survival (as documented by extremely low p-values), the actual amount of variability explained by the models is typically not stated and may be overestimated. This is analogous to the impact of large sample size in randomized trials, in which the large numbers of patients are able to achieve an extremely low p-value despite a small absolute improvement in clinical outcome. In AML, it has been shown that even with inclusion of various mutations as measured pre-treatment, our ability to predict survival as quantified by areas under receiver operating characteristic curves is approximately only midway between certainty and a coin flip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Many MDS patients will already have an elevated ferritin at diagnosis if their anemia has been long-standing, due to increased compensatory iron absorption and also inappropriate iron supplementation before the underlying diagnosis is clear. Higher ferritin levels (eg, &gt;1000) tend to worsen the prognosis of lower risk patients to a greater extent than lower ferritin levels improve the prognosis of higher risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. What remains unknown is whether lowering serum ferritin levels with chelation therapy will improve morbidity and mortality in MDS. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another prognostic feature in MDS is mutation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> loss of heterozygosity of the tumor suppressor gene P53.

Their presence has been associated with complex karyotypic changes, an increased tendency to evolve into AML, reduced responses to chemotherapy, and shorter overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes-in-adults/abstract/35-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with therapy-related MDS (t-MDS) were not included in the original IPSS or the WPSS.

Corresponding rates for two-year survival were 77, 47, 35, and 8 percent, respectively. However, multivariate analyses that account for treatment as well as other covariates are unavailable. As such, whether the prognosis of MDS varies according to marrow cellularity is uncertain.

As a result, patients with MDS are at risk for symptomatic anemia, infection, and bleeding, as well as progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is often refractory to treatment. Of note, most patients with MDS die because of the consequences of bone marrow failure rather than transformation to AML. (See <a href=\"#H2100127\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The natural history of patients with MDS is varied. This heterogeneity reflects both known and unknown differences in the pathobiology of specific subtypes within MDS and patient related characteristics, such as age and prior exposure to chemotherapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are three main prognostic systems that have been developed and validated in patients with MDS to predict both overall survival and AML evolution. These systems have not been directly compared. They incorporate many of the same variables with minimal changes in weighting:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The original International prognostic scoring system (IPSS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50634\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50634 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50664\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50664 \">table 2</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-myelodysplastic-syndrome-international-prognostic-scoring-system-original-ipss-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) and the revised IPSS (IPSS-R) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85832 \">table 5</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-revised-international-prognostic-scoring-system-ipss-r-in-myelodysplastic-syndrome\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) &ndash; The IPSS and IPSS-R are the most widely used prognostic classification systems for MDS. Both systems were developed based upon survival data from patients with primary (de novo) MDS based upon the French American British (FAB) classification system and treated with supportive care. While the IPSS and IPSS-R provide information regarding the natural history of MDS, they were not designed for patients with therapy-related MDS (t-MDS) or for the serial prognostication of patients as their disease evolves. (See <a href=\"#H2102498\" class=\"local\">'International prognostic scoring systems (IPSS and IPSS-R)'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>WHO prognostic scoring system (WPSS) &ndash; The WPSS was designed for patients diagnosed with MDS based upon the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of MDS. It incorporates information regarding the MDS subtype, red blood cell transfusion need, and cytogenetics. Like the IPSS, the WPSS was not designed for use in patients with t-MDS, but it was validated for use at any time during the disease course and for patients undergoing a variety of treatment strategies, including hematopoietic cell transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H861596\" class=\"local\">'WHO prognostic scoring system (WPSS)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) MDS model &ndash; The MDACC MDS model incorporates information regarding the patient&rsquo;s performance status, age, number and degree of cytopenias, cytogenetics, bone marrow blast percentage, and red blood cell transfusion need (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-mdacc-myelodysplastic-syndrome-prognostic-model-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 3</a>). Like the WPSS, the MDACC MDS model was designed to be used in patients with a spectrum of treatments at any point during their disease course. Of importance, unlike the IPSS and the WPSS, the MDACC MDS model included patients with de novo MDS, secondary MDS, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) with leukocytosis. (See <a href=\"#H861696\" class=\"local\">'MD Anderson cancer center MDS model'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple other factors have been shown to add significant prognostic information to that provided by the prognostic scoring systems described above. It is not clear as of yet how they might be incorporated into clinical use. (See <a href=\"#H2102505\" class=\"local\">'Other prognostic features'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Freifeld AG, Bow EJ, Sepkowitz KA, et al.
