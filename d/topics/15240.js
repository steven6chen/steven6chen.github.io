A specific objective was to induce sustained remission from short-term B cell depletion, based on the hypothesis that autoantibodies could not only produce tissue pathology but might be expected to drive their own production through a vicious cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rituximab-and-other-b-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although this has yet to be achieved, B cell depletion therapy has been found to have a major impact on RA in the short term.</p><p>Interest in B cell depletion was fueled by new evidence for the potential pathogenic role of immune complexes in RA. The beneficial effects of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents highlighted the importance of the production of TNF by macrophages within the joint. The association of RA with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II allotype implicated a CD4-T cell dependent process, but it was not clear whether this involved T cell help for antibody production or a direct effect of T cells on macrophages. Work on macrophage Fc-gamma receptors showed that TNF production in synovium might be explained by the binding of small IgG-based immune complexes to these receptors rather than by the action of cytokines from antigen&ndash;stimulated T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rituximab-and-other-b-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The evidence for this remains conflicting.</p><p>Central to the concept of B cell depletion therapy was the idea that pathogenic B cell clones and their autoantibody products might be engaged in a vicious cycle of self-perpetuation that does not require T cell autoreactivity. The interruption of such a cycle would restore immune tolerance and, therefore, might allow sustained benefit. This objective has been partially achieved. Although the majority of patients relapse within the first eighteen months after treatment, a small number of patients remain well for longer (occasionally up to four years) after a single course of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rituximab-and-other-b-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>B cell depletion has been associated with clinical improvement in many (but not all) conditions associated with autoantibody production. In contrast, a variety of conditions that are seronegative conditions (eg, psoriasis) does not appear to respond to this intervention. Nevertheless, modest improvement has been reported in seronegative RA, and there remains a possibility that, in at least some cases, a therapeutic effect is achieved through B cell functions involved in supporting T cell effector mechanisms.</p><p>Antigen presentation by B cells and cytokine-mediated interactions with stromal and accessory cells could potentially activate autoreactive T cells, although there is some doubt as to whether this is consistent with the behavior of synovial T cells in RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rituximab-and-other-b-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. B cells are very efficient at presenting soluble antigen that has been bound by their antigen receptor (surface immunoglobulin) during the acquisition of T cell help.</p><p>Clarification of the roles of B cells in RA is crucial to future developments in B cell targeted therapy and to the way we use this strategy. If the main role of B cells is to activate autoreactive pathogenic T cell clones through antigen presentation, one would expect patients to require continuous B cell depletion for their disease to remain under control. If autoantibodies play a key role in propagation of the disease, then achieving sustained remissions from short periods of depletion seems a much more realistic prospect. Progress so far is promising, and exploration of more potent depleting regimens or more subtle approaches to blocking signals involved in B cell proliferation is to be expected soon.</p><p>The clinical application of B cell targeted therapies for patients with RA is presented here. Much of the discussion focuses on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, a chimeric monoclonal antibody that depletes B cells. Other B cell directed treatments that may be clinically relevant are also reviewed. The effectiveness and safety of B cell targeted therapy in other diseases, including lymphoma, and in selected autoantibody mediated disorders are discussed separately in relation to the specific disease or disorder.

Expression of CD20 on the cell surface is lost as B cells differentiate into plasma cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> causes B cell depletion and may do so through one or more of several antibody-dependent mechanisms, including the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rituximab-and-other-b-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fc receptor gamma-mediated antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and phagocytosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complement-mediated cell lysis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth arrest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B cell apoptosis</p><p/><p>It is uncertain which of these mechanisms is most important in the depletion of B cells in patients with RA, although some data suggest that Fc receptor gamma-mediated antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent phagocytosis are the principal mechanisms.</p><p>Absent CD20 protein expression on the surface of plasma cells accounts for resistance of these long-lived antibody-producing cells to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>. As a consequence of plasma cell resistance, overall immunoglobulin levels usually remain within the normal range, despite profound B cell lymphopenia that persists for months following a single course of treatment. However, there are data that levels of autoantibodies with the potential for roles in disease pathophysiology are affected by B cell depletion, suggesting that these autoantibodies are produced at least in part by short-lived plasma cells. Examples of this include rheumatoid factor (RF) in RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rituximab-and-other-b-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], anti-double stranded (ds)DNA in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rituximab-and-other-b-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in ANCA-associated vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rituximab-and-other-b-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>One study has also suggested that treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> may also result indirectly in substantial but reversible depletion of CD4+ T cells during the months following rituximab administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rituximab-and-other-b-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The relevance of these findings is supported by the observation that a lack of CD4+ T cell depletion was associated with an inadequate clinical responsive to rituximab therapy. These findings require further confirmation, and there is an ongoing mechanistic clinical trial investigating the relationship between T-cell depletion and clinical response to rituximab in RA (NCT02784106).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial uncontrolled studies of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, alone or in combination with glucocorticoids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, suggested a beneficial effect on the clinical manifestations of RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rituximab-and-other-b-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/1,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14,15</a>].

Furthermore, they are not completely protective, even for SIRs. Therefore, despite the use of premedication, patients must be monitored closely during and immediately following all infusions. In our experience, close monitoring of the patient during the infusion, as recommended by the manufacturer, and adjustment of the dose, if symptoms or signs suggesting an infusion reaction occur, allow completion of the treatment in the great majority of patients.</p><p>Premedication protocols have largely been derived from the experience in patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> for malignancy.
