While the time course that differentiates acute liver failure from chronic liver failure varies between reports, a commonly used cutoff is an illness duration of &lt;26 weeks. </p><p>Acute liver failure may also be diagnosed in patients with previously undiagnosed Wilson disease, vertically acquired hepatitis B virus, or autoimmune hepatitis, in whom underlying cirrhosis may be present, provided the disease has been recognized for &lt;26 weeks. On the other hand, patients with acute severe alcoholic hepatitis, even if recognized for &lt;26 weeks, are considered to have acute-on-chronic liver failure since most have a long history of heavy drinking. The approach to such patients is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-management-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and management of alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute liver failure has also been referred to as fulminant hepatic failure, acute hepatic necrosis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, and fulminant hepatitis. Untreated, the prognosis is poor, so timely recognition and management of patients with acute liver failure is crucial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Whenever possible, patients with acute liver failure should be managed in an intensive care unit at a facility capable of performing liver transplantation.</p><p>This topic will review and the management and prognosis of acute liver failure in adults. The etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of patients with acute liver failure are discussed separately.

Only 40 percent of patients with acute liver failure recover spontaneously, leaving many in need of a liver transplantation, and even those who do eventually recover are often gravely ill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As a result, patients admitted to hospitals without a liver transplantation program should be transferred as soon as possible, since it can be hazardous to transfer patients later in the disease course because of severe coagulopathy and increased intracranial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This includes patients who do not yet appear to be gravely ill, such as those with no or minimal (now referred to as covert) hepatic encephalopathy. If a patient has comorbid illnesses that likely preclude liver transplantation, it is reasonable to discuss the appropriateness of transfer with a transplant hepatologist.

If there is progression to grade II encephalopathy, or for patients presenting with grade II, III, or IV encephalopathy, management in an intensive care unit is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Stimulation can lead to increased intracranial pressure and should be minimized. This may be challenging in an intensive care unit. Whenever possible, patients' rooms should be quiet, without audible monitors or alarms in the room, and dimly lit.

Serum aminotransferases and bilirubin should be monitored daily. More frequent monitoring (three to four times daily) should be performed for coagulation parameters, complete blood counts, metabolic panels, and arterial blood gasses. In particular, patients should be monitored and treated for hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia. We perform finger sticks to monitor blood glucose levels every six hours. (See <a href=\"#H233812427\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic abnormalities'</a> below.)</p><p>Decreasing aminotransferase levels may indicate spontaneous recovery but could also signal worsening liver failure with loss of hepatocyte mass. In patients who are improving, the bilirubin and prothrombin <span class=\"nowrap\">time/international</span> normalized ratio (INR) will decline, whereas in those with worsening liver failure, the bilirubin and prothrombin <span class=\"nowrap\">time/INR</span> will continue to rise. Because of the prognostic importance of the prothrombin <span class=\"nowrap\">time/INR,</span> it is recommended that plasma only be used when there is a clear indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

In addition, patients may have intravascular volume depletion because of decreased oral intake and extravasation of fluid into the extra-vascular space. As a result, most patients will require fluid resuscitation initially. Patients who are hypotensive should be resuscitated with normal saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients who are acidotic can be resuscitated with half-normal saline with 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>. Dextrose should be added to crystalloid solutions in patients with hypoglycemia. However, it is important to avoid overhydration since it may worsen cerebral edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance and replacement fluid therapy in adults&quot;, section on 'Replacement fluid therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Some patients may not respond adequately to fluid resuscitation may require vasopressor support. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure of at least 75 mmHg or a cerebral perfusion pressure of at least 50 to 60 mmHg. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Norepinephrine</a> is often preferred because it is thought to best augment peripheral organ perfusion with less tachycardia and better preservation of splanchnic blood flow than other agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vasopressin</a> may be added in those who do not respond to norepinephrine to potentiate the effect of norepinephrine.

While additional studies are needed before this therapy can be routinely recommended for acute liver failure from causes other than acetaminophen toxicity, it is reasonable to give it to patients who are not candidates for liver transplantation, to patients in whom acetaminophen toxicity may be contributing to the liver failure (eg, a patient with acute hepatitis B who was taking acetaminophen for right upper quadrant pain), and to patients with an indeterminate cause for the acute liver failure.</p><p>A placebo-controlled trial involving 173 patients with acute liver failure due to causes other than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> (mainly drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis B virus, or indeterminate) found significantly higher transplant-free survival (40 versus 27 percent) in patients randomized to N-acetylcysteine (initial loading dose 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per hour over one hour followed by 12.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per hour for four hours, then continuous infusions of 6.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per hour for the remaining 67 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

However, conventional indices of coagulation (eg, the international normalized ratio [INR]) are not helpful in determining a patient's bleeding risk. Because of this, patients who require an invasive procedure or who develop bleeding may need additional testing, such as a determination of fibrinogen levels, thromboelastography, or thromboelastometry, to guide management. The management of patients with liver disease who require an invasive procedure or develop bleeding is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease#H61498824\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with liver disease&quot;, section on 'Bleeding'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease#H166552210\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with liver disease&quot;, section on 'Invasive procedure'</a>.) </p><p>Prophylactic administration of fresh frozen plasma is not recommended since it has not been proven to influence mortality in a small randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], can interfere with assessments of liver function, and may lead to fluid overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Because the most common site of bleeding is the gastrointestinal tract, patients should receive stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker or proton pump inhibitor. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H233814522\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection surveillance and prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with acute liver failure are at increased risk of infection and sepsis from a wide variety of causes, so an aggressive approach to diagnosing and treating infections is necessary. The most common sites of infection are the respiratory tract, the urinary tract, and the blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Localizing signs of infection, such as fever and sputum production, are frequently absent, and the only clue to an underlying infectious process may be worsening of encephalopathy or renal function. </p><p>Guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) suggest that all patients (including those without signs of infection) should have routine (eg, daily) urine, sputum, and blood cultures, as well as chest radiographs to detect bacterial or fungal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. While we agree with the AASLD suggestion, it is important to note that data are lacking regarding the value of surveillance cultures or radiographs in this population, and positive culture results in the absence of signs of infection may be due to colonization or contamination by bacterial or fungal organisms.</p><p>In addition to surveillance cultures, we suggest an evaluation for possible infection in patients with signs or symptoms suggesting infection (eg, fever, cough, sputum production) or deteriorating clinical status, particularly if there is worsening encephalopathy or worsening renal function. In addition to urine and blood cultures for bacterial or fungal infection and diagnostic chest radiographs, patients with ascites should undergo diagnostic paracentesis if ascites is present.</p><p>The role of prophylactic antibiotics is controversial. While a randomized trial with 59 patients with acute liver failure who were not infected at entry found that prophylactic antibiotics reduced the rate of infection, a survival benefit was not seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In a retrospective study of 1551 patients with acute liver failure, antimicrobial prophylaxis did not reduce the incidence of bloodstream infection (13 with prophylaxis versus 16 percent without) or mortality within 21 days (30 percent in both groups) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Our approach to antibiotic prophylaxis is similar to that recommended by the AASLD. We do not give patients prophylactic antibiotics, but instead give them only if there is evidence of active infection, positive surveillance culture results, or clinical deterioration (progression to high-grade encephalopathy or evidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome [SIRS]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, having a low-index of suspicion for fungal infection is important because fungal infections are frequently encountered and are often diagnosed too late to be effectively treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. We have a low threshold for initiating antifungal coverage for patients with signs of infection who are at increased risk for fungal infection, such as those who have had prolonged hospitalization, those receiving continuous venovenous hemodialysis, and those who have been receiving an antibiotic or glucocorticoids.</p><p>If the decision is made to provide empiric broad spectrum antibiotic coverage, nephrotoxic antibiotics, particularly the aminoglycosides, and hepatotoxic antibiotics should be avoided. We often use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/tazobactam</span> or a fluoroquinolone. In addition, surveillance cultures are not needed in patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H233814623\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nutritional support is a vital component in the treatment of acute liver failure and should be initiated early. It is required to prevent catabolism of body stores of proteins and it may decrease the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding from stress ulceration in critically ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. To prevent protein catabolism, severe protein restrictions should be avoided; a daily intake of 60 grams of protein is reasonable for most patients with acute liver failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with grade I or II encephalopathy, oral or enteral feeding is usually sufficient to meet metabolic requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Enteral feeding should be provided for patients with grade III or IV encephalopathy. Placement of a nasogastric tube can increase intracranial pressure (because of gagging) and should generally be performed only in patients who are intubated and sedated. If adequate enteral feeding cannot be provided, parenteral nutrition should be initiated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H233810382\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications to avoid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, sedation should be avoided because patients with acute liver failure have a severely impaired ability to clear sedatives, and the effects of sedation may mask the signs of worsening encephalopathy or cerebral edema. However, in patients with severe agitation that cannot be managed in any other way, short-acting benzodiazepines in low doses may be given [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In patients who require sedative medications, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, are preferable to opioids because opioids can decrease the seizure threshold. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Hepatic encephalopathy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Cerebral edema'</a> below.)</p><p>Because acute renal failure often complicates acute liver failure, nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided. In addition, intravenous contrast agents should be used with caution.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H233810228\"><span class=\"h2\">Unhelpful treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of interventions have been studied that are unhelpful for acute liver failure and should generally not be used.</p><p>Such treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoids, which increase the risk of sepsis, although they may have a potential role in severe autoimmune hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment#H8058952\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Fulminant hepatitis and acute liver failure'</a>) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic regeneration therapy using insulin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Charcoal hemoperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prostaglandin E, which appeared to have promise in uncontrolled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], but was subsequently shown to be ineffective in controlled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H233807383\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF THE UNDERLYING CAUSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For some causes of acute liver failure, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> toxicity, treatment aimed at the underlying cause may prevent the need for liver transplantation and decrease mortality.

A potential advantage is that this procedure may support the patient while the native liver regenerates, obviating the need for chronic immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/49,106\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,106</a>]. In addition, because only a relatively small portion of liver is required, the graft can be obtained from a donor liver that is being used for a standard orthotopic liver transplantation or from a living-related donor, thereby increasing the number of available organs.</p><p>There are also reports of auxiliary liver grafts being reused in second recipients with chronic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. If the native liver recovers, the graft can be removed and transplanted into a second patient. While auxiliary liver transplantation shows promise, the procedure is technically difficult, and has not been adequately evaluated in controlled clinical trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H233808232\"><span class=\"h3\">Xenotransplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Xenotransplantation (transplantation of a nonhuman organ) has been attempted for the treatment of acute liver failure. Prior to 1992, only 33 xenotransplantations had been performed in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The longest graft survival was only nine months. Despite the initial disappointing results, this approach is being reevaluated, in part because of advances in immunosuppression and the ability to manipulate donor antigen expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/108-112\" class=\"abstract_t\">108-112</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H233808239\"><span class=\"h3\">Other experimental approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been studied for the treatment of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). The theory behind the approach is that mobilization of bone marrow-derived stem cells with G-CSF may promote hepatic regeneration. In a randomized trial with 47 patients with ACLF, 23 were assigned to receive G-CSF 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> subcutaneously daily for five days and then every three days for a total of 12 doses, and 24 were assigned to receive placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. None of the patients had decompensated liver disease prior to the onset of ACLF. Patients treated with G-CSF had a higher actuarial probability of survival at 60 days than those treated with placebo (66 versus 26 percent) and were less likely to develop hepatorenal syndrome (19 versus 71 percent), hepatic encephalopathy (19 versus 66 percent), or sepsis (14 versus 41 percent). None of the patients who survived underwent emergent liver transplantation.</p><p>High-volume plasma exchange has also been tried in patients with acute liver failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/114-116\" class=\"abstract_t\">114-116</a>]. It is theorized that plasma exchange may have beneficial effect by removing plasma cytokines and adhesion molecules, replacing plasma factors, and modulating the immune system. In a randomized trial with 182 patients with acute liver failure, there was no difference between those treated with high-volume plasma exchange and those who received standard medical care alone in the primary endpoint of liver transplantation-free survival during hospitalization (26 and 36 percent, respectively; p = 0.17) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. However, the group who received high-volume plasma exchange did have higher overall hospital survival (59 versus 48 percent; hazard ratio after stratifying for liver transplantation 0.56, 95% CI 0.36-0.86).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84582719\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall, survival rates in patients treated for acute liver failure are greater than 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis/abstract/72,117\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,117</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H233807110\" class=\"local\">'General management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with acute liver failure should be managed at a liver transplant center whenever possible. Patients with grade I encephalopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62922\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62922 \">table 1</a>) may be managed on a general medical ward, provided the environment is quiet and frequent neurologic checks (eg, every two hours) are performed. If there is progression to grade II encephalopathy, or for patients presenting with grade II, III, or IV encephalopathy, management in an intensive care unit is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H233810318\" class=\"local\">'Setting'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serial laboratory tests are used to follow the course of a patient's liver failure and to monitor for complications. Serum aminotransferases and bilirubin should be monitored daily. More frequent monitoring (three to four times daily) should be performed for coagulation parameters, complete blood counts, metabolic panels, and arterial blood gasses. We perform finger sticks to monitor blood glucose levels every six hours. (See <a href=\"#H233810325\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For some causes of acute liver failure, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> toxicity, treatment aimed at the underlying cause may prevent the need for liver transplantation and decrease mortality. (See <a href=\"#H233807383\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of the underlying cause'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with hepatic encephalopathy due to acute liver failure, we suggest not routinely treating with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactulose</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Lactulose has not been shown to improve overall outcomes, and it may lead to bowel distension that could result in technical difficulties during liver transplantation. However, if lactulose is used, endotracheal intubation should be performed prior to its administration in patients with advanced (grade III or IV) encephalopathy. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Hepatic encephalopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients at high risk for developing cerebral edema (ie, patients with grade IV encephalopathy or with grade III encephalopathy that is rapidly progressing), we suggest using intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring to guide treatment for cerebral edema, rather than basing treatment decisions on the clinical signs of cerebral edema (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Early in the course of acute liver failure, signs and symptoms of cerebral edema may be absent or difficult to detect. Complications of cerebral edema include ICP elevation and brainstem herniation. However, ICP monitoring has not been shown to increase overall survival and is associated with complications such as infection and bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Cerebral edema'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General measures to prevent ICP elevation include minimizing stimulation, maintaining appropriate fluid balance, and elevating the head of the patient's bed. For patients who are at high risk of developing cerebral edema, we also suggest prophylactic treatment with hypertonic saline (3 percent), with a goal serum sodium of 145 to 155 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). High-risk patients include patients with grade IV encephalopathy, high ammonia levels (&gt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> or acute renal failure, and patients who require vasopressor support. (See <a href=\"#H229243145\" class=\"local\">'Preventing intracranial pressure elevation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with ICP elevation, we suggest initial treatment with a bolus of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> (0.5 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg)</span> rather than hyperventilation therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). One or two additional boluses may be given if needed, provided the serum osmolality is &lt;320 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/L</span>. The goals of therapy are to maintain the ICP below 20 to 25 mmHg and the cerebral perfusion pressure above 50 to 60 mmHg. Patients receiving mannitol should be monitored for hyperosmolarity and hypernatremia. (See <a href=\"#H60324522\" class=\"local\">'Hyperosmotic agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 40 percent of patients with acute liver failure will recover spontaneously with supportive care. Prognostic models have been developed to help identify patients who are unlikely to recover spontaneously, because the decision to proceed with liver transplantation depends in part upon the probability of spontaneous hepatic recovery. Of those who receive a transplantation, one-year survival rates are greater than 80 percent.
