Early and delayed infections are mostly acquired during implantation, whereas late infections are primarily due to hematogenous seeding. In one review of 63 consecutive infections associated with hip prostheses, these types of infections occurred with approximately equal frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The timing of infection is also an important clue as to the identity of the infecting organism, as discussed in the following sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-27</a>].</p><p>Diagnosis of PJI may be more likely to be delayed following knee arthroplasty compared with hip arthroplasty; in one study including 661 infections, the median time to diagnosis was 25 days following hip arthroplasty versus 42 days following knee arthroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Asymptomatic PJI may be detected incidentally in the setting of revision surgery. In one study including 679 total hip arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty revision surgeries, PJI (defined as 2 or more positive cultures with the same organism) was diagnosed in 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21070478\"><span class=\"h2\">Early onset infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early onset infections (&lt;3 months after surgery) are usually acquired during implantation; they are often due to relatively virulent pathogens, such as <em>S. aureus</em>, gram-negative bacilli, or anaerobic or polymicrobial infection. Early onset infection can also arise in the setting of postoperative wound dehiscence with contiguous spread of organisms from the superficial wound to the deeper structures.</p><p>Most early onset infections present with the acute onset of one or more of the following symptoms: wound drainage, implant site erythema, induration or edema, joint pain, joint effusion, or fever. These infections are frequently associated with hematoma formation or superficial necrosis of the incision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21070485\"><span class=\"h2\">Delayed onset infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delayed onset infections (from 3 to 12 months after surgery) are also usually acquired during implantation; they are often due to less virulent pathogens, such as <em>Cutibacterium</em> (formerly <em>Propionibacterium</em>) species, coagulase-negative staphylococci, or enterococci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Most delayed onset infections present with a prolonged indolent course characterized primarily by persistent joint pain, with or without early implant loosening. A minority of patients have signs and symptoms associated with early onset infection. Fever is present in less than 50 percent of cases, and leukocytosis occurs in only 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Sinus tract associated with intermittent drainage can be seen when the diagnosis is delayed or in untreated patients. Delayed onset infections may be difficult to distinguish from aseptic failure of the prosthetic joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,32</a>]. Persistent joint pain is suggestive of infection, whereas mechanical loosening commonly causes pain with joint motion and weight bearing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21070504\"><span class=\"h2\">Late onset infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Late onset infections (&gt;12 months after surgery) frequently develop hematogenously in the setting of infection at another site (such as vascular catheter, urinary tract, or soft tissue infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In such cases, patients typically present with acute onset of symptoms of infection in a previously well-functioning joint. It is not always possible to determine whether a PJI arose hematogenously, even if the onset of symptoms is acute.</p><p>In one study involving 50 cases of acute hematogenous PJI, the median onset time after surgery was nearly five years; a distant source for the infection could be identified in approximately one-half of the cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Most hematogenous infections are due to <em>S. aureus</em>, beta-hemolytic streptococci, or gram-negative bacilli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In a prospective study of 44 patients with prosthetic joints and staphylococcal bacteremia, PJI occurred in 34 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21069582\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29479717\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The timing of infection is an important clue as to the identity of the infecting organism, as discussed in the preceding section. Early and late onset infections are often due to relatively virulent pathogens, such as <em>S. aureus </em>or gram-negative bacilli. Delayed onset infections are often due to less virulent pathogens, such as <em>Cutibacterium</em> (<em>Propionibacterium</em>) species and coagulase-negative staphylococci. One review noted the following distribution of microorganisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> &ndash; 22 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coagulase-negative staphylococci &ndash; 19 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mixed infection &ndash; 19 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta-hemolytic streptococci &ndash; 9 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli &ndash; 8 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anaerobes &ndash; 6 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No organisms detected &ndash; 12 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other organisms &ndash; 5 percent</p><p/><p>The type of pathogen also varies with the site of implanted joint and underlying comorbidities. For example, <em>Cutibacterium acnes</em> is relatively more common after shoulder arthroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>], whereas <em>S. aureus</em> prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is more common in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p><em>S. aureus</em> small colony variants (SCVs) have been identified in some cases of PJIs after treatment failure with standard antimicrobial regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. SCVs are naturally occurring, slow-growing subpopulations of <em>S. aureus</em> with distinctive phenotypic characteristics and pathogenic traits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. These strains appear to emerge in patients initially infected with normally growing <em>S. aureus</em>. The cause of infection in these cases can be difficult to identify due to the slow growth of SCVs; in some cases, these organisms have an auxotrophic phenotype (eg, a requirement for specific nutritional substances to restore the normal growth rate) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>Species identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the setting with PJIs may be useful in some circumstances. For example, <em>S. lugdunensis</em> is a coagulase-negative <em>Staphylococcus</em> that shares some aspects of virulence with <em>S. aureus</em> but is commonly susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxacillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxacillin</a>. In a review of 28 episodes of <em>S. lugdunensis</em> PJI, 24 of 28 isolates demonstrated in vitro susceptibility to oxacillin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staphylococcus-lugdunensis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staphylococcus lugdunensis&quot;</a>.)</p><p><em>C. acnes</em> is a relatively common cause of PJI following shoulder arthroplasty (16 percent in one study) but is a rare cause of infection following hip or knee arthroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a retrospective case series of 35 patients with definite or probable <em>C. acnes</em> orthopedic infection, 57 percent became symptomatic &le;30 days after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. <em>C. avidum</em> was a predominant cause of hip PJI in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In a case-control study involving 40 patients with PJI due to <em>Cutibacterium</em> species, prior joint surgery and male gender were independent risk factors for infection (odds ratio 28 and 7, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p><em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> and rapidly growing mycobacteria are rare causes of PJIs.

Among 897 patients with PJIs in one series, 7 percent were culture negative. The majority (64 percent) of these patients had received antibiotics prior to the collection of specimens for culture. Outcomes following empiric treatment were similar to outcomes among patients with positive cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Biofilm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Susceptibility to infection is enhanced in the setting of a foreign body due to formation of a biofilm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>Device-adherent bacteria multiply and elaborate exopolysaccharides (&quot;glycocalyx&quot;). Eventually, microcolonies of bacteria encased in glycocalyx coalesce to form a structure known as a biofilm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. Although bacteria near the surface of the biofilm are usually metabolically active and have access to nutrients that diffuse through the upper surface of the biofilm, organisms deep within the biofilm are metabolically inactive or in various stages of dormancy and are protected from host defenses. Such organisms are highly resistant to antimicrobial agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The microenvironment within a biofilm may also adversely affect mechanisms involved in antimicrobial activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], and diffusion of antimicrobial agents through biofilm is often slow or limited.</p><p>The resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents within biofilm is a time-dependent phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

These findings are related to the duration of infection; three to six months may be required before manifestation of such changes. In addition, these changes are not specific for infection; they are also seen frequently with aseptic processes.</p><p>Scintigraphy (such as technetium-colloid scans or gallium-67 labeled white blood cell scans) is rarely useful in early infection; scans may be falsely abnormal for up to 12 months following surgery due to periprosthetic bone remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. In addition, technetium-colloid scans can be positive in the setting of aseptic loosening. In one report of 144 patients who underwent revision hip arthroplasty, bone gallium imaging offered no additional advantage in diagnosis over hip aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].
