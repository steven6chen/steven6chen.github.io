(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of favorable prognosis early (stage I-II) classical Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These successes with RT, used either alone or in combination with other modalities, resulted in large cohorts of cancer survivors who are subject to late complications from treatment. Analyses have shown that the therapeutic benefits from RT may be offset to some extent by delayed effects on the heart, thereby reducing the benefits of RT.</p><p>The treatment of HL frequently includes supradiaphragmatic RT portals that include portions of the heart, and HL survivors have a significantly increased incidence of cardiovascular complications. Clinical manifestations of cardiotoxicity include acute or delayed pericardial disease, myocardial ischemia or infarction, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, valvular abnormalities, or conduction defects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma#H11941396\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the approach to the adult survivor of classical Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Cardiovascular disease'</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of HL has evolved in tandem with our understanding of the long-term consequences of treatment, with the goal of decreasing the intensity of therapy without sacrificing long-term disease control. These efforts have included reduction in the volume and dose of incidental cardiac irradiation through modifications in RT techniques, and recognition of the relationship between efficacy, and dose and volume in the setting of combined modality therapy. These contemporary techniques appear to have substantially decreased the incidence of delayed complications, although whether or not there still is some residual risk remains uncertain.</p><p>The incidence of cardiotoxicity and its clinical manifestations secondary to RT in patients with HL or pediatric malignancies are discussed here. The pathophysiology of RT-induced cardiac injury and the role of RT-induced cardiotoxicity in other malignancies are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiotoxicity of radiation therapy for breast cancer and other malignancies&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H296728689\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A significant increase in the incidence of cardiovascular disease has been observed in multiple studies of long-term survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>The cardiotoxic effects of radiation therapy (RT) in HL survivors were illustrated by a comprehensive analysis of 1474 patients who were treated between 1965 and 1995 according to European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The median age at the start of treatment was 26 years, and the median follow-up was 19 years. The initial treatment consisted of RT only in 28 percent of the patients, chemotherapy alone in 5 percent, and combined RT and chemotherapy in 67 percent. Overall, 84 percent of patients received RT to the mediastinum. The standardized incidence ratios for various complications were calculated compared with age- and sex-matched incidences in the general population.</p><p>Key findings included the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common cardiovascular diagnoses observed in HL survivors were valvular disorders, angina pectoris, and myocardial infarction. The median time to diagnosis of these cardiac complications was approximately 19 years after treatment. The incidence of each of these complications was significantly elevated, with standardized incidence ratios between 3 and 5.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multivariate analysis, mediastinal irradiation significantly increased the risks of coronary heart disease, heart failure, and valvular disorders. Use of anthracyclines further increased the risks of heart failure and valvular disorders associated with mediastinal irradiation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increased risk of cardiovascular disease persisted for at least 25 years after the initial treatment.</p><p/><p>Data from a nested case-control study of 2617 five-year survivors treated with mediastinal radiation between 1965 and 1995 in the Netherlands support a linear dose-response relationship for coronary heart disease. The risk of cardiotoxicity associated with mediastinal radiation was reported to be related to both the volume of the heart irradiated and the dose received by the heart. Three hundred and twenty-five patients developed coronary heart disease manifested by myocardial infarction or angina requiring intervention. These patients were compared with 1204 matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For patients receiving a mean heart dose of 20 Gy, there was a 2.5-fold increase in the risk of coronary heart disease&nbsp;compared with patients not treated with mediastinal RT.&nbsp;The excess relative risk seemed to decrease with increasing age, increased for patients with risk factors (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia), and decreased with high levels of physical activity.</p><p>A study of 615 Canadian HL survivors treated between 1988 and 2000 has demonstrated that modern treatment methods continue to be associated with cardiac morbidity, even within 10 to 15 years after therapy. This study also suggested that the risk from combined modality therapy (mediastinal RT of 30 to 35 Gy and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> of 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> was greater than mediastinal RT alone, although the difference in risk between the two groups was not statistically significant due to small sample size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The relative risk for cardiac disease is increased within the first few years after RT, and this risk appears to increase over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>A more recent, large, survey-based study of patients treated for HL on nine collaborative EORTC-Lymphoma Study Association (LYSA) trials (mean follow-up nine years after diagnosis) reported that the hazard ratio for cardiovascular events increased with the estimated mean cardiac doses in an approximately linear fashion, but the confidence intervals were large [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The risk of cardiovascular complications following RT appears to be even greater when HL patients are treated during childhood. (See <a href=\"#H3554248908\" class=\"local\">'Pediatric patients'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2820136813\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The factors that influence the risk of cardiac damage in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients include the total dose and volume of radiation therapy (RT), the dose per fraction, the specific RT technique (ie, the percentage of dose delivered from an anteroposterior field rather than opposed fields), and the extent to which the coronary arteries are included in the RT field.</p><p>The use of combined modality treatment that includes cardiotoxic chemotherapy, such as an anthracycline, appears to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, as illustrated by a study of 1474 HL survivors younger than 41 years at treatment and followed for a median of 19 years. Multivariate analysis showed that the combination of mediastinal RT plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy significantly increased the risk of both heart failure and valvular disorders (hazard ratio 2.8 and 2.1, respectively, compared with mediastinal RT alone) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The cumulative incidence of heart failure 25 years after combined RT and anthracycline treatment for HL was 7.9 percent.</p><p>In addition to treatment-related issues, patient-specific factors that are likely to influence the risk of developing coronary artery disease can be important. These include the patient age at the time of treatment and the presence of other known cardiac risk factors, such as smoking, high serum cholesterol, and hypertension.</p><p>A limited number of exercise intervention studies in lymphoma survivors (HL and non-HL), both on and off active treatment, suggest that aerobic exercise is safe and can improve cardiac function and energy levels, at least in the short term. These included two randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>] and one nonrandomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] demonstrating increased maximum oxygen consumption and self-reported energy level in HL survivors with chronic fatigue. However, the sample size was too small to correlate these changes, and none of the three studies was limited to just patients who had or were receiving RT. (See <a href=\"#H3457273096\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3457273096\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1926536230\"><span class=\"h2\">Myocardial infarction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple studies have demonstrated that the risk of a fatal myocardial infarction in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors is 2.2 to 7.6-fold greater than in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies/abstract/2,7,12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,12-16</a>]. The increased risk of death from myocardial infarction was illustrated by an analysis of 7033 HL survivors treated between 1967 and 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Key observations from this study included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of death from myocardial infarction in this cohort was significantly increased compared with the general population (standardized mortality ratio 2.5, 95% CI 2.1-2.9).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increased risk of death from myocardial infarction was limited to those who had received supradiaphragmatic radiation therapy (RT) or anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. Those whose treatment consisted solely of infradiaphragmatic RT did not have an increase in mortality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increased risk of death persisted beyond 20 years. This persistence of risk for an extended period has been observed in other studies and appears to be greatest in those treated during childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies/abstract/14,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3966678467\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiomyopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Irradiation causes fibrosis of the myocardium, which can lead to a restrictive cardiomyopathy. The physiologic correlate of this observation is that mediastinal RT appears to have a greater impact on diastolic rather than systolic cardiac function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. This is in contrast to the effects of anthracyclines, which predominantly cause systolic dysfunction. The prevalence of dysfunction varies depending upon RT technique and dose, concomitant use of anthracyclines, length of follow-up, and method of screening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3036598954\"><span class=\"h3\">Diastolic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diastolic dysfunction may be detected by echo Doppler studies in asymptomatic patients who have received radiation therapy for HL. Survivors with diastolic dysfunction have a significantly worse cardiac event-free survival and worse quality of life.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, diastolic dysfunction was detected in 40 (14 percent) of 282 patients who had received a minimum of 35 Gy to the mediastinum for HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The average time from radiation treatment to assessment was 18 years. Exercise-induced ischemia was more common in patients with diastolic dysfunction (23 versus 11 percent in those with normal function). Patients with diastolic dysfunction had worse event-free survival than patients with normal function (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.06-2.4).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another series, 20 of 37 (54 percent) patients who had received prior mediastinal RT had echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

The prevalence of HF increases in association with increasing doses of mean left ventricular dose (MLVD), and the rate of HF increases with anthracycline dose.</p><p>A case-control study compared 91 patients with moderate or severe HF as their first cardiovascular event with 278 matched controls who were diagnosed with HL before 51 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Findings included: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HF occurred after a median interval of more than 20 years, most patients had grade 2 or 3 HF, and the median interval from diagnosis of HF to death was 3.6 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HF rate increased in a non-linear dose-response relationship with radiation dose; there was little evidence of an increased rate of HF for MHDs in the range of 1 to 25 Gy, but a steep increase with MHDs &ge;25 Gy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HF rate increased nearly threefold in the setting of anthracycline-based chemotherapy irrespective of cardiac radiation exposure, and rates were not affected by anthracycline dose (ie, &lt;280 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> compared with &ge;280 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span>. There was not a multiplicative (synergistic) effect between RT and anthracycline treatment, but the ability to study the interaction between the two modalities was limited. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3901072069\"><span class=\"h2\">Valvular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mediastinal RT has been associated with an increased risk of clinically significant valvular abnormalities particularly involving the aortic, mitral and tricuspid valves in 6 to 40 percent of HL survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies/abstract/19,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21-24</a>]. Many of the common abnormalities that are found in HL patients would lead to consideration for antibiotic prophylaxis for endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies/abstract/21,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25</a>].</p><p>The risk of valvular heart disease and its relationship to dose of radiation is well illustrated by a case-control study nested with a cohort of 1852 five-year survivors of HL treated between 1965 and 1995 at three centers in the Netherlands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. It should be noted that the radiation techniques utilized during the earlier years of this study would not be used today.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cumulative risk for valvular heart disease in the entire series was 8 percent at 30 years. The median interval between the diagnosis of HL and the diagnosis of valvular heart disease was 23 years. However, for patients treated with the doses of 20 to 30 Gy that are currently used, the 30-year risk is increased by only approximately 1.4 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>This study compared the 89 cases (4.8 percent of the total cohort) with valvular heart disease (66 percent severe or life-threatening) with 200 controls in the cohort without valvular disease, matched by age, gender, and year of diagnosis. The median follow-up was 19 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doses of radiation to the heart valves were calculated for each case. The risk of valvular heart disease increased more than linearly; for affected heart valves receiving &le;30, 31 to 35, 35 to 40, and &ge;40 Gy, the relative risks were 1.4, 3.1, 5.4, and 11.8, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following the diagnosis of valvular heart disease, its severity increased by 56 percent over a median follow-up of 7.6 years.

During a median follow-up of 13.4 years (range 2 to 39), mild or more severe valvular disease was present in 61.2 percent of the 50 HL survivors who had received mediastinal RT (median dose 40 Gy [range 28 to 44]), compared with 31 percent of the 32 HL survivors without mediastinal RT (odds ratio 3.51, 95% CI 1.32-9.30, p = 0.01). Severe disease was present in 24.5 and 3.4 percent of survivors in each group, respectively (p = 0.016). Aortic regurgitation was most prevalent, and irradiated patients had significantly more mild or more severe regurgitation compared with the unirradiated patients (38.2 versus 6.8 percent, p = 0.007).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3130112162\"><span class=\"h2\">Conduction defects and autonomic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation can cause fibrosis of the conduction pathways in the heart, potentially leading to life-threatening arrhythmias <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> conduction defects years after therapy for HL. Abnormalities observed after mediastinal RT include bradycardia, complete and lesser degrees of heart block, and sick sinus syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies/abstract/19,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an electrocardiographic study with a mean follow-up of 15 years, abnormalities were identified in 35 of the 47 survivors who had an electrocardiogram (74 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The most common findings were conduction delays in the right anterior bundle, which suggests that the anterior structures of the intracardiac conduction system are at greatest risk for fibrosis from mediastinal RT. In addition, 24-hour Holter monitoring suggested a high rate of autonomic dysfunction; 24 of 42 patients (57 percent) had a monotonous heart rate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> loss of circadian variability, while 13 (31 percent) had sustained tachycardia over 24 hours (&gt;90 beats per minute).

Such treatment involved exposure of large volumes of the heart to high doses of radiation. Although newer treatment techniques reduce both the dose of radiation and the volume of heart within the RT field, it is not clear whether the risk of late complications has been reduced in magnitude or simply delayed in the time to onset. However, a true reduction in severity is likely.</p><p>For patients with favorable, early stage, mediastinal lymphoma, omitting RT is sometimes an option to minimize the risk of delayed cardiotoxicity.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Aleman BM, van den Belt-Dusebout AW, De Bruin ML, et al.
