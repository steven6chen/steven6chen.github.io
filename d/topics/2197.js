They have become the focus of scientific study leading to technological advances that have permitted these high-flow lesions to be treated, often with a multidisciplinary approach utilizing surgical, endovascular, and radiosurgical techniques.</p><p>This topic review will discuss brain AVMs. Three other general subtypes of congenital vascular malformations have been described: developmental venous anomalies, capillary telangiectasias, and cavernous malformations. These are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular malformations of the central nervous system&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain AVMs occur in about 0.1 percent of the population, one-tenth the incidence of intracranial aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Supratentorial lesions account for 90 percent of brain AVMs; the remainder are in the posterior fossa. They usually occur as single lesions, but as many as 9 percent are multiple [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Brain AVMs underlie 1 to 2 percent of all strokes, 3 percent of strokes in young adults, and 9 percent of subarachnoid hemorrhages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3151912\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain AVMs are considered sporadic congenital developmental vascular lesions, but their pathogenesis is not well understood. Rare cases of familial brain AVMs have been reported but it is unclear if these are coincidental or indicate true familial occurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, genetic variation may influence brain AVM development and clinical course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>There is a higher prevalence of vascular malformations associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT; Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome). Patients with HHT may have cerebral or spinal cord involvement with telangiectasias, brain AVMs, aneurysms, or cavernous malformations. The presence of more than one brain AVM, otherwise uncommon, is highly predictive of HHT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia-osler-weber-rendu-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The angioarchitecture of brain AVMs is direct arterial to venous connections without an intervening capillary network. Both the arterial supply as well as the venous drainage may be by single or multiple vessels. Gliotic brain is usually admixed with the vascular tangle, and calcification may be seen in the vascular nidus and surrounding brain. The high-flow arteriovenous communication potentiates a variety of flow-related phenomena such as the development of afferent and efferent pedicle aneurysms, which occur in 20 to 25 percent of patients, and arterialization of the venous limb. Aneurysms can be a source of bleeding in patients with brain AVMs and are thought to worsen their prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Abnormal flow and a vascular steal phenomenon have been suggested to underlie some clinical symptoms associated with brain AVMs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Histopathological studies demonstrate areas of chronic ischemia and gliosis in the region of the malformation.</p><p>The size of brain AVMs varies widely. While brain AVMs are considered congenital, some have been observed to undergo growth, remodeling, or regression over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/1,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1199086076\"><span class=\"h2\">Presenting symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain AVMs usually present between the ages of 10 and 40 years. The patient&rsquo;s age, as well as the size, location and vascular features of the AVM influence the clinical presentation which typically falls into one of four categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracranial hemorrhage (41 to 79 percent) &ndash; Children are more likely to present with hemorrhage than adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Hemorrhages are usually intraparenchymal, but primary bleeding into the subarachnoid space is also common for superficial AVMs. The clinical presentation of these events is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizure (11 to 33 percent) &ndash; Patients with cortically-located, large, multiple, and superficial-draining AVMs are more likely to present with seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>]. Seizures are typically focal, either simple or partial complex, but often have secondary generalization. The location of the AVM influences the seizure type and semiology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Localization-related (focal) epilepsy: Causes and clinical features&quot;</a>.) <br/><br/>Epilepsy may also develop subsequent to presentation. In one series, the 5-year seizure risk for AVMs that were discovered incidentally was 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In contrast, patients who presented with ICH or focal neurologic deficits had a 23 percent 5-year risk of seizures. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache &ndash; There are no specific headache features that associate with AVM, which may be incidental to the headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In one study, 0.2 percent of patients with headache and normal neurologic examinations were found to have an AVM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal neurologic deficit &ndash; This presentation is fairly unusual for cerebral AVM. While a vascular steal syndrome has been hypothesized to cause this presentation, in most cases this is related to mass effect, hemorrhage, or seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92720247\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemorrhage risk after presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A meta-analysis summarized the natural history of cerebral AVMs as reported in nine studies including 3923 patients and 18,423 patient-years of follow-up and reported an overall annual hemorrhage rate of 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In earlier retrospective studies, the average annual mortality in patients with untreated brain AVMs ranged from 0.7 to 1.0 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p>Risk factors have been identified that appear to impact hemorrhage rates:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhage as the initial clinical presentation was the strongest predictor for subsequent hemorrhage in patients with untreated brain AVMs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/17,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20,21</a>]. According to the systemic review, the annual rate of hemorrhage is 2.2 percent (95% CI: 1.7 &ndash; 2.7) for unruptured AVMs and 4.5 percent (95% CI: 3.7 &ndash; 5.5) for ruptured AVMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In one database, children were not at higher risk of subsequent ICH after initial hemorrhage when compared with adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Clinically silent hemorrhage, seen on neuroimaging, is also a risk factor for subsequent hemorrhage according to another series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anatomic and vascular features of the AVM also appear to influence risk of subsequent hemorrhage. These include the presence of associated aneurysms (HR 1.8), exclusive deep venous drainage (HR 2.4), and deep brain location (HR 2.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/17,20,21,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20,21,23,24</a>]. AVM size does not appear to impact hemorrhage risk.</p><p/><p>Combinations of these risk factors may identify patients at particularly high risk. In the Columbia databank, patients whose AVMs lacked hemorrhage at initial presentation, deep venous drainage, and deep brain location had an annual hemorrhage rate of 0.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In contrast, those with all three risk factors had an annual hemorrhage rate as high as 34.4 percent. Among 241 patients with untreated AVMs in the Columbia databank who initially presented with hemorrhage, a recurrent AVM hemorrhage occurred in 12 percent over an average 1.8 years of follow-up, yielding a crude rebleeding rate of 7 percent annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>Pregnancy is NOT a risk factor for hemorrhage from a brain AVM according to most of the available data, but the issue is controversial, and the data are not definitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. One of the better studies was a retrospective analysis of 451 women with a brain AVM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The AVM hemorrhage rate in pregnant women in this population was not significantly different compared with the rate for nonpregnant women (3.5 versus 3.1 percent per person-year).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8887936\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain AVMs are typically first identified on cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI); angiography is required to plan therapy. A combination of MRI and angiography is often used to assess the likely success and risks of surgical, endovascular, or radiosurgical therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flow voids may be identified on CT with contrast administration in and around the region of the nidus of the brain AVM. CT characteristically demonstrates intraparenchymal hemorrhage without significant edema in patients who present with hemorrhage. However, compression of the nidus by the hematoma often precludes CT diagnosis of brain AVM in the setting of acute intracerebral hemorrhage; more sensitive techniques such as MRI or angiography are required in such cases. The sensitivity of CT to identify brain AVMs in the acute setting may be improved by CT angiography.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI is very sensitive for delineating the location of the brain AVM nidus and often an associated draining vein. It also has unique sensitivity in demonstrating remote bleeding related to these lesions. Dark flow voids are appreciated on T1 and T2-weighted studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53992\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53992 \">image 1</a>). </p><p>MRI also is particularly valuable in following patients after treatment. After radiosurgery, for example, the regression of the nidal volume can be accurately measured and followed. Advanced MR angiography techniques may allow characterization of venous drainage and other vascular features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, surrounding tissue that is subjected to the radiation field can be accurately monitored for post-therapy edema or, in some cases, radiation necrosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis, treatment planning, and follow-up after treatment of brain AVMs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75190\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75190 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62349\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62349 \">picture 2</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anatomical and physiological information such as the nidus configuration, its relationship to surrounding vessels, and localization of the draining or efferent portion of the brain AVM are readily obtained with this technique. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of associated aneurysm suggests a lesion at higher risk for subsequent hemorrhage. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contrast transit times provide additional useful information regarding the flow state of the lesion; this is critical for endovascular treatment planning.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of variables that are known to affect the natural history of AVMs and the risk of intervention are considered when making a decision whether to treat an AVM and with what modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Acute intracerebral hemorrhage and seizures are generally managed independently.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1199085160\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment modalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is the mainstay of treatment; radiosurgery is a useful option in lesions deemed at high risk for surgical therapy, and endovascular embolization can be a useful adjunct to these techniques. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3151852\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical excision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open microsurgical excision has the longest history of use for the definitive treatment of selected patients with AVMs and offers the best chance immediate cure in patients considered to be at high risk of hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The surgery is complicated and often requires detailed planning with review of imaging studies.</p><p>An important factor in recommending therapy is an assessment of surgical risk. Multiple or large lesions, those in eloquent brain areas, and those with deep venous drainage are more difficult to safely resect. Many surgeons use these considerations to construct a classification system (Spetzler-Martin grading scale) that assesses the surgical risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71261\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71261 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Several studies have correlated surgical risk with higher Spetzler-Martin grading scale score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Female gender may also increase surgical risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>A modification of the Spetzler-Martin grading scale that supplements the neuroimaging information with clinical features (age, gender, baseline disability), may perform better in predicting surgical risk, but requires independent validation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Other grading scales are also being evaluated for this purpose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Stereotactic radiosurgery</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H601582\"><span class=\"h4\">Lesion obliteration and hemorrhage risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stereotactically focused high energy beams of photons or protons to a defined volume containing the brain AVM nidus induces progressive thrombosis of properly selected lesions via fibrointimal hyperplasia and subsequent luminal obliteration. The time course of the induced pathologic events is usually one to three years, sometimes longer, and the time between treatment and obliteration is referred to as the latency period. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stereotactic-cranial-radiosurgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stereotactic cranial radiosurgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The magnitude of hemorrhage risk during the latency period between treatment and obliteration is uncertain; however, the best evidence suggests that it gradually declines during this interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. This is an important consideration, particularly for lesions at higher bleeding risk. Existing studies are generally limited by retrospective and observational design. Earlier studies reported conflicting results, including increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>], decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>], and unchanged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>] bleeding rates during the latency period. One of the largest studies including 500 patients found that the risk of hemorrhage declined by 54 percent during the latency period and by 88 percent after obliteration. The risk reduction was greater among patients who presented with hemorrhage than those who presented without hemorrhage. Another study including 657 patients had similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. An untreated cerebral aneurysm was found to be a risk factor for hemorrhage in the latency period in another consecutive case series; the hemorrhage rate was 6.4 percent per year for untreated aneurysms versus 0.8 percent per year for clipped or embolized aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p>Once the lesion is completely obliterated, the hemorrhage risk from the brain AVM is very low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>], but not totally eliminated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/47,49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,49-51</a>]. Incomplete lesion obliteration, hypertension, and prior hemorrhage are risk factors for late bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. </p><p>Successful brain AVM obliteration with radiosurgery depends upon lesion size and dose of radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Complete cure is considerably higher with smaller lesions; an overall 80 percent obliteration rate by three years occurs with lesions that are 3 cm or smaller [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/38,52-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,52-55</a>]. Larger lesions have reported obliteration rates of 30 to 70 percent at three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/52,54,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,54,56</a>]. Brain AVMs with a diffuse nidus or associated neovascularity were less likely to achieve a radiographic cure in one clinical series of 248 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Despite the lower initial success rates for angiographic obliteration seen with larger brain AVMs (&gt;3 cm), some amount of lesion volume reduction (mean 66 percent) typically occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. </p><p>The success rate of radiographic brain AVM obliteration also varies with the amount of radiation delivered to the margin of the lesion. Doses of 16, 18, and 20 Gy are associated with obliteration rates of about 70, 80, and 90 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. In one series, brainstem lesions were associated with lower obliteration rates, perhaps because of more conservative radiation dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Radiation dose is generally selected according to a protocol which takes in account the size and location of the lesion. </p><p>Retreatment with radiosurgery is effective for complete obliteration in about 60 to 80 percent of patients with residual brain AVMs, depending on the size and other factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/58,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h4\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications after radiosurgery include radiation necrosis, which can produce new neurologic deficits and seizures. In a multinational study that included 1255 patients undergoing radiosurgery for cerebral AVMs, therapy-related complications developed in 102 (8 percent) and included radiographic parenchymal lesions, cranial nerve deficits, seizures, headaches, and cyst formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Symptoms were disabling in 21, fatal in two, and resolved completely in 42 (41 percent). The risk of radiation necrosis with permanent neurologic deficit is 1 to 3 percent in most reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/52,54,59,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,54,59,65</a>]. In another case series, 10 of 75 patients who had not had seizures and were not on antiseizure drugs before radiosurgery had provoked seizures after radiosurgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>The incidence of complications are related to the brain AVM location and the volume treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/55,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,67</a>]. Thalamic, basal ganglionic, and brainstem locations are particularly prone to development of deficits after radiosurgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/62,67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,67,68</a>]. The risk of complications is also related to the radiation dose directed to the surrounding tissue.</p><p>The risk of complications is also increased in large brain AVMs that require larger treatment volumes. In a series of 73 patients, in whom one-half of the brain AVMs were &gt;3 cm in diameter, the incidence of post-treatment imaging abnormalities and clinical complications rose with increasing treatment volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. In patients whose treatment volumes were &gt;14 mL and who received a dose &ge;16 Gy, the incidence of post-treatment MRI abnormalities was 72 percent, and 22 percent required resection for radiation necrosis. The rate of post-treatment hemorrhage was also higher for treatment volumes &ge;14 mL (7.5 versus 2.7 percent per person-year).</p><p>Repeated radiosurgery is also associated with increased complications; but the rate is not clearly prohibitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/63,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,70</a>].

Embolization prior to radiosurgery is employed to reduce the nidus size of large brain AVMs to less than 10 cm3, as these large AVMs have a lower cure rate with radiosurgery alone.

There is only limited evidence from randomized clinical trials to guide treatment decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/76-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-78</a>], and there are no defined absolute indications for AVM treatment. A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that all available treatments were associated with considerable risks, including a 5.1 to 7.4 percent median rate of permanent neurologic complications or death, and incomplete efficacy of 13 to 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. </p><p>Management decisions are most appropriately made by a multidisciplinary team of experienced clinicians who consider size, location, and vascular features of the AVM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>In determining whether a patient should undergo AVM treatment several factors are considered, most importantly the estimated risk of future hemorrhage, both in the short and long term, as well as the feasibility and risks of intervention. The available data suggest that a history of previous rupture is one of the most important considerations; others include those factors that are believed to impact long term bleeding risk, such as patient age, AVM location, size, and other vascular features. Patients with AVMs and intractable epilepsy may also be considered for AVM treatment. (See <a href=\"#H3474402\" class=\"local\">'Seizures'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1285036100\"><span class=\"h3\">Ruptured versus unruptured AVM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a prior history of AVM rupture are at higher risk of subsequent hemorrhage than those without this history.

Patients with unruptured AVMs were assigned to medical versus interventional (surgery, radiotherapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> endovascular therapy) treatment. The trial was halted early with outcome data on 223 patients followed for a mean 33 months. Composite rates of symptomatic stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) and death were higher in the interventional compared to medical treatment group (31 versus 10 percent). Rates of neurological disability were also lower in conservatively-treated patients. Deaths occurred in two percent of patients in both groups. Patients will continue to be followed for an additional 5 years of follow-up. </p><p>Criticism of the ARUBA trial include that the follow-up period was relatively short at the time of initial analysis and publication, as well as the nonstandardized and variable treatment approaches used in the interventional arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. However, these results do substantiate previous findings from observational studies that suggested that interventional treatment of unruptured AVMs was associated with a worse outcome than no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,83</a>]. </p><p>AVM treatment is generally considered for patients with ICH, particularly if other considerations as outlined below favor treatment. In general, surgeons prefer to wait some months after ICH to operate on the AVM; absorption of the hematoma and resolution of any surrounding edema improve access to the AVM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In patients undergoing radiosurgery, hematoma resolution may improve accuracy of the targeting of the radiation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1285036125\"><span class=\"h3\">Other considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient&rsquo;s age, along with anatomic and vascular features of the AVM are also considered when making treatment decisions.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Age</strong> &ndash; Age is an important factor in the decision to treat brain AVMs; those with a longer life expectancy will accrue a higher lifetime risk of hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Thus, therapy is more usually recommended for children and young adults, while older individuals with shorter life expectancies may be managed more conservatively. (See <a href=\"#H92720247\" class=\"local\">'Hemorrhage risk after presentation'</a> above.)<br/><br/>The cumulative hemorrhage risk can be estimated by the formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lifetime risk of hemorrhage = 1 - (1 - P) ^ N<br/><br/>where N is the expected years of life remaining, and P is the annual probability of hemorrhage.<br/><br/>As an example, a 60-year-old woman with a newly diagnosed brain AVM and no other contributing comorbid conditions would expect to live approximately 20 years. If the annual risk of AVM hemorrhage is 3 percent, the formula gives a cumulative risk of hemorrhage over her expected life span of 46 percent. This compares with an overall risk of treatment morbidity and mortality of approximately 5 percent. </p><p/><p>An simpler approximation of the above formula is [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lifetime risk of hemorrhage = 105 - patient age in years<br/><br/>Thus, for the same 60-year-old patient, the simple formula gives a lifetime hemorrhage risk of 45 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>AVM location</strong> &ndash; Lesions in eloquent brain territories present a challenge for risk assessment; significant clinical morbidity is likely to result if a surgical complication occurs as well as if the AVM ruptures.

They occur in about 0.1 percent of the population. These are usually single, supratentorial lesions; their size can vary widely. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The angioarchitecture of brain AVMs is direct arterial to venous connections without an intervening capillary network. Aneurysms arise in 20 to 25 percent of lesions. (See <a href=\"#H3151912\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain AVMs usually present between the ages of 10 and 40 years with either intracranial hemorrhage, seizure, headache, and focal neurologic deficit. Hemorrhage is the most common presentation, particularly in children. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall, annual hemorrhage rates from brain AVMs are between 3 percent. After an initial hemorrhage, annual hemorrhage rates are approximately 5 percent. (See <a href=\"#H92720247\" class=\"local\">'Hemorrhage risk after presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain AVMs can be detected on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is more sensitive, particularly in the setting of an acute intracerebral hemorrhage. Angiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis, treatment planning, and follow-up after treatment of brain AVMs. (See <a href=\"#H8887936\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of variables are factored into the decision to treat AVMs and the therapy chosen. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment; radiosurgery is a useful option in lesions deemed at high risk for surgical therapy, and endovascular embolization has become a useful adjunct to these techniques. Important considerations in the choice of treatment are the patient's age, lesion size and location, and prior history of intracerebral hemorrhage.
