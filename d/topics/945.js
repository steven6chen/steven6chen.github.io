Angina pectoris, or angina for short, is the term used when chest discomfort is thought to be attributable to myocardial ischemia. In patients with myocardial ischemia, chest discomfort is often but not always present, although other associated symptoms with ischemia may be present (such as exertional shortness of breath, nausea, diaphoresis, fatigue). This has been termed &quot;anginal equivalent.&quot; Myocardial ischemia in the absence of chest discomfort or another anginal equivalent symptoms is termed &quot;silent ischemia.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silent-myocardial-ischemia-epidemiology-diagnosis-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Silent myocardial ischemia: Epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with suspected myocardial ischemia, timely diagnosis and treatment is necessary to treat symptoms and possibly also reduce morbidity and mortality. Rapid diagnosis is particularly important in patients with a possible acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, or ST-elevation myocardial infarction). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-acute-coronary-syndrome-myocardial-infarction-unstable-angina-in-the-emergency-department\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the emergency department&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the pathophysiology, clinical features and diagnosis of ischemic chest discomfort. Discussions of other cardiac and noncardiac causes of chest pain, and their clinical presentations, are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outpatient-evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain#H1220523363\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outpatient evaluation of the adult with chest pain&quot;, section on 'Etiologies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myocardial ischemia, and consequently angina, occurs whenever myocardial oxygen demand exceeds oxygen supply (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53315\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53315 \">table 1</a>). Detailed reviews of the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia are available in the scientific literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Myocardial oxygen demand</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are four major factors that determine myocardial work and therefore myocardial oxygen demand:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart rate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systolic blood pressure (the clinical marker of afterload)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocardial wall tension or stress (the product of ventricular end-diastolic volume or preload and myocardial muscle mass)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocardial contractility</p><p/><p>Myocardial contractility and wall stress cannot be measured clinically. As a result, myocardial oxygen demands are estimated clinically by the multiplication product (also called the <strong>double product</strong>) of the heart rate and the systolic blood pressure. Individuals reproducibly experience angina during exercise testing when functional capacity exceeds a well-defined <strong>angina</strong>&nbsp;<strong>threshold</strong> or absolute double product value.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Myocardial oxygen supply</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major determinants of oxygen supply are the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood, which is affected by a variety of factors including oxygen tension and the hemoglobin concentration; the degree of oxygen unloading from hemoglobin to the tissues, which is related to 2,3 diphosphoglycerate levels; and the coronary artery blood flow delivered to the myocardium. The latter is influenced by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary artery diameter and tone (resistance) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Collateral blood flow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perfusion pressure. This is determined by the pressure gradients from the aorta to the coronary arteries. Coronary blood flow from the epicardium to endocardial capillaries is determined by the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart rate, which affects the duration of diastole; importantly, coronary artery flow primarily occurs during diastole. The percent of diastolic time decreases as the heart rate increases. Thus, heart rate is a determining factor for both oxygen demand and supply.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3857434\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF ANGINA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms responsible for the sensation of angina are complex and not entirely understood. An important feature is that myocardial ischemia results in the development of acidosis and also reduces the formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the loss of the normal ATP sodium-potassium pump, the loss of myocardial membrane integrity, and the release of chemical substances that stimulate chemosensitive and mechanoreceptive receptors innervated by unmyelinated nerve cells found within cardiac muscle fibers and around the coronary vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The substances that are released include lactate, serotonin, bradykinin, histamine, reactive oxygen species, and adenosine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. In addition, there are substances released from platelets, which often spontaneously aggregate in the area of a coronary artery stenosis, which may also be responsible for myocardial ischemia and angina. These include serotonin, thromboxane A2, and 5-hydroxytyrptamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>There is substantial evidence that the primary mediator of angina is adenosine, via stimulation of the A1 adenosine receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. It is also possible that venodilation as a response to ischemia can activate these receptors. The nerve fibers travel along the sympathetic afferent pathways from the heart and enter the sympathetic ganglia in lower cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord (C5-6 and T1-T6). Impulses are then transmitted via the ascending spinothalamic pathways to the medial and lateral thalamus and ultimately activate several areas of the cerebral cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Angina is a discomfort that is referred to the corresponding dermatomes that supply sympathetic afferent nerves to the same segments of the spinal cord as the heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Furthermore, stimulation of sensory receptors in different myocardial regions results in the transmission via the same neural pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These characteristics account for two typical features of angina: It is often a diffuse discomfort felt in the chest, neck, lower jaw, and down the arm (typically the left arm, although some patients experience right arm discomfort). Most patients experience angina in the same distribution, regardless of which area of the myocardium is ischemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. An exception is often post-cardiac surgery, as this may interrupt and alter the neural supply to the heart, which may affect the distribution of angina. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16944489\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ENTITIES ASSOCIATED WITH MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, any significant imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand can lead to myocardial ischemia and angina. Patients may have a supply or a demand problem, but many have both. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19918374\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased supply</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most of the world, atherosclerotic obstruction of one or more coronary arteries (coronary artery disease) is the most common cause of myocardial ischemia. Other clinical conditions associated with a decrease in supply due to disease in one or more coronary arteries include coronary artery vasospasm, coronary microvascular disease, myocardial bridging, fibrosis, embolism, dissection, and arteritis. Left ventricular hypertrophy may result in a reduction in subendocardial blood flow and oxygen supply; this may result in angina. This may be particularly important with the development of arterial hypertension, which may increase left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, resulting in impairment of capillary flow in the subendocardium. </p><p>Other examples of inadequate supply include shock (any cause), hypoxemia, anemia, and postprandial angina resulting from a redistribution of blood flow away from territories supplied by severely stenosed coronary arteries to those supplied by less diseased or normal arteries (ie, a steal phenomenon) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19918380\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased demand</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical conditions associated with an increase in myocardial oxygen demand include any situation in which there are increased catecholamines or sympathetic tone, as with vigorous exertion or mental stress, tachycardia for any reason, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (with hypertensive heart disease or aortic stenosis), and right ventricular hypertrophy (with pulmonary hypertension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H358110146\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with myocardial ischemia will present with classic angina pectoris as the primary clinical manifestation. Classic angina pectoris is described as a pressure, heaviness, tightness, or constriction in the center or left of the chest that is precipitated by exertion and relieved by rest. It is generally not described as pain (sharp or dull), or needles and pins.</p><p>However, some patients with myocardial ischemia may present with exertional shortness of breath, nausea, diaphoresis, or fatigue rather than chest discomfort. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silent-myocardial-ischemia-epidemiology-diagnosis-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Silent myocardial ischemia: Epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The initial presentation of myocardial ischemia with angina may be one of a stable pattern or an acute coronary syndrome. Patients with recent onset of chest discomfort, episodes of rest chest discomfort, or one or more prolonged episodes (more than 20 minutes), should be evaluated in an acute care facility for the possibility of an acute coronary syndrome. However, every patient has their first episode of chest discomfort so that recent onset is not necessarily an acute coronary syndrome, particularly if the pattern of occurrence is stable and predictable (ie, with exertion). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-acute-coronary-syndrome-myocardial-infarction-unstable-angina-in-the-emergency-department\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the emergency department&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H358110160\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elements of the history that are critically important include characteristics of the discomfort, associated symptoms, precipitating factors, and information about social and family history.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H358110706\"><span class=\"h3\">Typical qualities of anginal pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should attempt to elicit information about the following characteristics of the discomfort:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Quality </strong>&minus; Angina is usually characterized more as a discomfort rather than pain. Terms frequently used by patients include squeezing, tightness, pressure, constriction, strangling, burning, heart burn, fullness in the chest, band-like sensation, knot in the center of the chest, lump in throat, ache, heavy weight on chest (elephant sitting on chest), like a bra too tight, and toothache (when there is radiation to the lower jaw) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In some cases, the patient cannot qualify the nature of the discomfort, but places his or her fist in the center of the chest, known as the &quot;Levine sign.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is generally not described as sharp, dull-aching, knife-like, stabbing, or pins and needles-like. In a report of patients presenting to the emergency department, &quot;sharp&quot; or &quot;stabbing&quot; pain was a low risk description, particularly when the pain was pleuritic or positional, was fully reproducible by palpation, and the patient had no history of angina or myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The following additional characteristics are typically seen:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Angina is typically gradual in onset and offset, with the intensity of the discomfort increasing and decreasing over several minutes. In contrast, noncardiac pain is often of greatest intensity at its onset and often has an abrupt onset and offset.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Since angina is a referred discomfort, patients tend to have the same quality of chest discomfort with recurrent ischemic episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Generally, it is felt in the same location. The discomfort is generally the same prior to or with a myocardial infarction and is the same quality as prior to revascularization by either surgery (although the location may be different due to disruption of neural innervation of the heart) or percutaneous coronary intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Angina is a constant discomfort that does not change with respiration or position. It is also not provoked or worsened with palpation of the chest wall. However, the presence of a change in pain with respiration (or position) or pain elicited by palpation does not exclude angina as the cause.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Location and radiation </strong>&minus;<strong> </strong>As noted above, angina is a referred pain due to involvement of a neural reflex pathway via the thoracic and cervical nerves. As a result, it is not felt in a specific spot, but is usually a diffuse discomfort that may be difficult to localize.</p><p/><p>The patient often indicates the entire chest when asked where the discomfort is felt. Pain that localizes to one small area of the chest is more likely of chest wall or pleural origin rather than visceral.</p><p>Angina is referred to the corresponding dermatomes (C5-6 and T1-T6) that supply afferent nerves to the same segments of the spinal cord as the heart. Thus, angina often radiates to other parts of the body, including the upper abdomen (epigastric), shoulders, arms (upper and forearm), wrist, fingers, neck and throat, lower jaw and teeth (but not upper jaw), and rarely to the back (specifically the interscapular region) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Radiation to both arms is a stronger predictor of acute myocardial infarction. The location and radiation of angina is usually the same each time. Occasionally, the location and radiation, but not quality, may be different after bypass surgery due to the disruption of the neural innervation of the heart.</p><p>Isolated back pain is unusual in patients with angina. However, it may be seen with an aortic dissection that also involves the coronary arteries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Provoking factors </strong>&minus;<strong> </strong>Angina is often elicited by activities and situations that increase myocardial oxygen demand, including physical activity, cold, emotional stress, sexual intercourse, meals, or lying down (which results in an increase in venous return and increase in wall stress) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Patients should be questioned about the use of cocaine or other recreational drugs, as they may trigger myocardial ischemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-the-cardiovascular-complications-of-cocaine-abuse#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of the cardiovascular complications of cocaine abuse&quot;, section on 'Myocardial ischemia/infarction'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Postprandial pain is generally considered to be gastrointestinal in origin. However, it may also be anginal, especially in patients with severe ischemia (eg, left main or three vessel coronary disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Timing </strong>&minus;<strong> </strong>Angina occurs more commonly in the morning due to a diurnal increase in sympathetic tone. Enhanced sympathetic activity raises heart rate, blood pressure, vessel tone and resistance (resulting in a reduced vessel diameter that causes any fixed lesion to be more occlusive), and promotes platelet aggregation (resulting in the release of vasoactive substances, such as serotonin and thromboxane A2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Duration and relief </strong>&minus;<strong> </strong>Classic angina is often relieved with termination of the provoking factor. Angina generally lasts for two to five minutes. It is not a fleeting discomfort, which lasts only for a few seconds or less than a minute, and it generally does not last for 20 to 30 minutes, unless the patient is experiencing an acute coronary syndrome, especially myocardial infarction.</p><p/><p>Factors that reduce oxygen demand or increase oxygen supply will result in relief of angina. These include cessation of activity or termination of the provoking factor, use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> (which is a venodilator, reducing venous return, and a coronary artery vasodilator that increases coronary blood flow), and sitting up (which reduces venous return and preload).</p><p>Relief of chest discomfort with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> is not specific for angina, since a similar response may be seen with esophageal spasm or other gastrointestinal problems as nitroglycerin also relaxes smooth muscle. In a review of 459 patients presenting to an emergency department with chest pain, the percentage of patients with relief of chest discomfort with nitroglycerin was similar among those with and without active coronary disease (35 versus 41 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Atypical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific chest pain characteristics can be used to help differentiate cardiac from noncardiac causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53227%7ECARD%2F77753\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53227 graphicRef77753 \">table 2A-B</a>).

It is essential to consider these alternate diagnoses to avoid potentially dangerous errors in management, such as the administration of thrombolytic therapy to a patient with an aortic dissection.

Pulmonary congestion is due to an elevation in left ventricular end diastolic pressure related to failure of the myocardium to relax normally in diastole (as relaxation or lusitropy is energy dependent). The resulting diastolic &quot;stiffness&quot; or diastolic dysfunction results in an increase in left ventricular end diastolic pressure, left atrial pressure, and pulmonary venous pressure, which is transmitted to the pulmonary vessels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other symptoms may include belching, nausea, indigestion, diaphoresis, dizziness, lightheadedness, clamminess, and fatigue.

For example, risk factors for coronary artery disease are often present in individuals with angina due to coronary artery disease.

This chemoreceptor is stimulated by serotonin secreted as a result of platelet aggregation, which often occurs in association with angina.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">New heart sounds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ischemia-induced myocardial dysfunction can lead to changes in the normal heart sounds. The second heart sound may become paradoxically split due to delayed relaxation of the left ventricular myocardium and delayed closure of the aortic valve. There may also be a third or fourth heart sound. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-heart-sounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of heart sounds&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">New/changed murmurs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impaired myocardial function may result in a new mitral regurgitation murmur, which appears to be due to papillary muscle dysfunction causing apical tethering or tenting of the leaflets, or changes in the intensity or timing of pre-existing murmurs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of chronic secondary mitral regurgitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Precordial pulsation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Palpation of the chest wall may reveal abnormal pulsations that correlate with transient left ventricular dysfunction. An area of dyskinesis may develop, especially at the apex of the left ventricle or at the anterior axillary line (location of the left ventricular wall), reflecting disease of the left anterior descending coronary artery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-precordial-pulsation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the precordial pulsation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Palpation of the left anterior chest wall at the anterior axillary line may reveal an abnormal tapping in systole, which reflects the presence of an area of dyskinetic contraction or aneurysm. Transient right ventricular dysfunction may lead to a transient right ventricular heave or sternal pulsation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H358110383\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients in whom the history and physical examination raise the possibility of myocardial ischemia as the cause of chest discomfort, an electrocardiogram should be obtained. An electrocardiogram obtained when the chest discomfort is present will often show J point and ST segment depression, which indicates subendocardial ischemia. When the patient is asymptomatic, the electrocardiogram may be entirely normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrocardiogram in the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia and infarction&quot;, section on 'Unexpected absence of diagnostic findings'</a>.)</p><p>A chest radiograph is often ordered but is not likely to confirm or refute the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia. Generally, the radiography is performed to screen for other causes of chest pain (eg, enlarged aorta, broken rib). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outpatient-evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outpatient evaluation of the adult with chest pain&quot;, section on 'Other diagnostic studies'</a>.)</p><p>Cardiac biomarkers (eg, troponin) are often obtained in patients with angina. However, they are unlikely to be elevated in patients with intermittent and relatively brief angina episodes. They may be useful when the anginal episode is more prolonged. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=troponin-testing-clinical-use#H3700263609\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Troponin testing: Clinical use&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis of acute MI'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H358110138\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of myocardial ischemia can often be made with a high likelihood based on the history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram. Such patients have classic angina (see <a href=\"#H358110146\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above), either a normal physical examination or features consistent with myocardial ischemia (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above), and an electrocardiogram that is normal in the absence of ongoing ischemia.</p><p>For example, in the patient with classic angina and multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease, the diagnosis is highly likely. Indeed, a history consistent with classical angina has a 93 percent predictive accuracy for the diagnosis of ischemia that is most often the result of coronary artery disease. </p><p>For some patients, additional testing is necessary to secure the diagnosis with certainty. Testing, particularly stress testing, is of value when the history is not completely consistent with angina or in a high-risk patient with symptoms that are atypical for ischemia.</p><p>We perform some type of stress testing in most patients for the purpose of prognosis.
