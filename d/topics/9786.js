The normal sequence of activation is altered dramatically in LBBB, with a resultant characteristic appearance on the ECG (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61594\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef61594 \">waveform 1</a>). </p><p>LBBB most often occurs in patients with underlying heart disease and may be associated with progressive conducting system disease. However, LBBB can also be seen in asymptomatic patients with a structurally normal heart. The presence of LBBB complicates the diagnosis of myocardial <span class=\"nowrap\">ischemia/infarction</span> and interferes with the interpretation of exercise testing. In patients with significant LV dysfunction, LBBB results in left ventricular dyssynchrony and may contribute to heart failure. </p><p>The anatomy, clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis, prognostic implications, and treatment of LBBB will be reviewed here. Additional details regarding the ECG manifestations of LBBB are discussed separately.

The main left bundle branch penetrates the membranous portion of the interventricular septum under the aortic ring and then divides into several fairly discrete branches.

Pathological studies in LBBB have suggested that the block may be proximal (particularly in diffuse myocardial disease), distal, or a combination of both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Electrophysiologic studies have revealed multiple and complicated patterns of myocardial activation, the heterogeneity of which depends upon the function or dysfunction of the distal specialized conduction system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Changes in myocardial activation only affect the left ventricle in LBBB; thus, changes in the morphologic features of local electrograms can be recorded in the left, but not the right, ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>An LV activation pattern study in patients with chronic heart failure and LBBB on ECG was studied in seven patients with an LV ejection fraction of less than 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Three patients had preserved activation of the left bundle despite LBBB on the ECG. Four had conduction block. The remainder had homogeneous depolarization propagation within the LV. These findings suggest that there are variable patterns of LV endocardial activation, which may be important in cardiac resynchronization therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications#H1748463281\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure: Indications&quot;, section on 'Rationale for CRT'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of LBBB increases with age, occurring in less than 1 percent of the general population, with estimates ranging from 0.2 to 1.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]. LBBB occurs infrequently in young healthy subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. As an example, a study of 237,000 airmen under age 30 found only 125 cases of LBBB, representing a prevalence of 0.05 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Ninety percent of these subjects had no apparent structural heart disease, and an isolated LBBB in young men was generally benign. </p><p>The increase in LBBB prevalence with age was illustrated in a prospective study of 855 Swedish men in the general population who were 50 years of age and followed for 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The prevalence of LBBB was 0.4 percent at age 50, 2.3 percent by age 75, and 5.7 percent by age 80. In this otherwise healthy population, there was no significant association with risk factors for or the presence of ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction or cardiovascular deaths, suggesting that LBBB is more commonly a marker of a slowly progressive degenerative disease of the conduction system. Among 66,450 participants in the Women's Health Initiative trial, 714 had LBBB at study entry, representing a prevalence of 1.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In contrast to the Swedish study, other studies have suggested an association between the new onset of LBBB and underlying advanced <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> advancing heart disease, particularly in older adults. This is illustrated in the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 5209 persons from the Framingham Heart Study followed for 18 years, 55 subjects developed LBBB at a mean age of 62 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Patients who developed LBBB had significantly higher rates of antecedent hypertension, cardiomegaly, and coronary heart disease. Coincident with or subsequent to the onset of the LBBB, 48 percent developed clinically apparent coronary disease or heart failure for the first time. Over the period of follow-up, only 11 percent of those who developed LBBB remained free of cardiovascular disease compared to 50 percent in an age-matched control group without LBBB.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 110,000 Irish subjects who underwent screening for cardiovascular disease, 112 were found to have LBBB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. At a mean follow-up of 9.5 years, patients with LBBB demonstrated a significantly increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease (21 versus 11 percent in patients without LBBB). </p><p/><p>The incidence of underlying cardiovascular disease is lower in younger subjects with LBBB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. However, because of the association of LBBB with the subsequent development of cardiovascular disease, even in otherwise asymptomatic patients, careful evaluation and follow-up are indicated. When LBBB is present, patients should be evaluated for hypertension, coronary disease, and other disorders that have been associated with LBBB (eg, myocarditis, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/6,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21,22</a>].

As such, numerous chronic conditions which contribute to myocardial fibrosis (eg, hypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies) can contribute to the development of LBBB.</p><p>LBBB may result following an acute myocardial insult such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, or myocarditis and in such circumstances is usually associated with a worse prognosis.

Echocardiography can be used to determine RVH and ventricular function in this setting.

It has been suggested that ST segment changes of &ge;0.5 mm from baseline in leads II and AVF are predictive of ischemia in the setting of left bundle branch block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, this observation does not change the recommendation to use other exercise modalities.

Canine studies suggest that incomplete LBBB may be a form of left septal (median) fascicular block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175773\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventricular tachycardia and accelerated idioventricular rhythm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the dominant ventricular rhythm originates from a pacemaker in the ventricle, the QRS will be widened and can have the appearance of a LBBB. However, both ventricular tachycardia (heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63176\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef63176 \">waveform 2</a>) and accelerated idioventricular rhythm (heart rate between 60 and 100 beats per minute) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52385\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef52385 \">waveform 3</a>) are associated with atrioventricular (AV) dissociation, which should distinguish the rhythm from a supraventricular rhythm with aberrant conduction seen with LBBB.

The magnitude of the effect on left ventricular dyssynchrony was illustrated in a report in which 18 patients with isolated LBBB were compared with 10 normal controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Isolated LBBB was associated with dyssynchronous contraction and a significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction than the controls (54 versus 62 percent, respectively). </p><p>The adverse effect of ventricular dyssynchrony due to LBBB is more pronounced in the presence of heart failure, possibly even serving as a primary cause of heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Several studies have reported that LBBB is an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with heart failure and is associated with increased all-cause mortality and sudden death at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>].

Among a single-center cohort of 608 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy followed for a median of 122 months, 189 patients (31 percent) had LBBB at baseline diagnosis while 47 patients (11 percent) developed a new LBBB during follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. While there was no significant increase in mortality related to baseline LBBB status, total mortality was markedly higher among patients with new LBBB compared with patients without new LBBB (49 versus 25 percent; adjusted HR 3.2; 95% CI 1.9-5.3).</p><p>Worse outcomes in heart-failure patients with LBBB may be expected due to dyssynchronous left ventricular activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. This observation provides the rationale for the use of cardiac resynchronization therapy with biventricular pacing in patients with heart failure who have an intraventricular conduction delay, primarily due to LBBB.

In one study of 17,277 exercise stress tests, during which 70 episodes of exercise-induced LBBB occurred, death from any cause and major cardiac events were significantly more common in the group with exercise-induced LBBB (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55830\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55830 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

In most patients, this can be accomplished with a careful history and physical examination. Cardiac resynchronization therapy is indicated for the treatment of heart failure in NYHA III or IV patients with a LBBB and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;35 percent, and it may prevent progression of heart failure in less symptomatic patients (MADIT-CRT). Therefore an assessment of LVEF, usually with echocardiography, is warranted to identify these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Focused additional testing (ie, stress testing with imaging) may be indicated for a subset of patients directed by findings from the history, exam, or other data.

However, permanent pacemaker insertion is indicated for patients who develop symptomatic conduction system disturbances, such as third degree or Mobitz type II second degree AV block, which is not associated with a reversible or transient condition. Patients with LBBB and syncope felt to be cardiac in nature may also be considered for treatment with a permanent pacemaker. In addition, as stated above, patients with LBBB and moderately to severely reduced LVEF may be considered for treatment with cardiac resynchronization therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-bundle-branch-block/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].

A temporary pacemaker may be considered for a patient undergoing right heart catheterization because of the potential for transient complete heart block associated with catheter manipulation. Temporary pacing is also indicated for a LBBB in association with an acute myocardial infarction, particularly when a first degree AV block is also present.
