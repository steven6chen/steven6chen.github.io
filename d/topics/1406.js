For example, in people who have had a heart attack or stroke, aspirin can help prevent another heart attack or stroke, or even death. Studies also suggest that aspirin can prevent heart attacks in people who have never had a heart attack or any type of heart or blood vessel disease. Plus, aspirin might protect against some forms of cancer and help people live longer. The type of cancer that aspirin seems to help most with is cancer of the colon or rectum (the lower part of the bowel).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90934215\"><span class=\"h1\">Can aspirin cause health problems?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> has a downside. It can cause serious internal bleeding. When aspirin causes bleeding, it is usually in the stomach or intestines. But bleeding can also happen in other parts of the body, such as the brain.</p><p>The risk of bleeding while taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> is not the same for everyone. Some people have a higher risk than others.</p><p>You are more likely to bleed while on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have had ulcers in your stomach or intestines (called peptic ulcers)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are 65 years old or older</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take high doses of medicines called nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use medicines called corticosteroids in the form of pills or shots. (It doesn't matter if you use these medicines in a cream or lotion that you put on your skin.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take medicines called &quot;anti-coagulants&quot; or blood thinners, such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Warfarin</a> (brand name: Coumadin)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Dabigatran</a> (brand name: Pradaxa)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Apixaban</a> (brand name: Eliquis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Rivaroxaban</a> (brand name: Xarelto)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=edoxaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Edoxaban</a> (brand names: Savaysa, Lixiana)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90934230\"><span class=\"h1\">How does aspirin prevent health problems?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When it comes to problems that affect the heart or blood vessels, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> can help because it helps prevent blood clots. Heart attacks and some strokes happen when blood clots form inside arteries. Aspirin helps keep that from happening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60394\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60394 \">figure 1</a>). When it comes to cancer, experts aren't sure why aspirin might help, but results of several studies suggest it does.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90934243\"><span class=\"h1\">What dose of aspirin can protect me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experts think the best dose to prevent health problems is 75, 80, or 100 milligrams a day. This is often called low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>. It is much less than the 325 milligram dose in a single aspirin pill that is used to treat pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90934258\"><span class=\"h1\">How long do I have to take aspirin?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who choose to take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> to prevent heart attacks or cancer will need to take it for many years. Aspirin starts preventing blood clots almost as soon as you take it. That means it can protect against heart attacks right away, but the protection wears off if you stop taking aspirin. It takes several years before aspirin protects against cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90934271\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I take aspirin to prevent health problems?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That is a decision you will have to make with your doctor. First ask your doctor or nurse whether you are someone who might benefit from taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>. Next ask if you would be at risk of bleeding if you took aspirin. Then work with your doctor or nurse to make a decision that is right for you. This graphic can help you understand the pros and cons of aspirin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F91458\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91458 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Be aware, though, that experts do not think that healthy people younger than 50 should take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> to prevent heart disease or cancer. They do think it could help people who are 50 and older, but only if they are not at high risk of bleeding.</p><p>Also, if you have already had a heart attack or have a strong family history of cancer, the decision you make with your doctor or nurse will be very different.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90934290\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-after-a-heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines after a heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atherosclerosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Atherosclerosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-and-rectal-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colon and rectal cancer (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-in-the-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart attack (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-and-rectal-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Colon and rectal cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
