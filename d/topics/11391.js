The phases of rehabilitation correspond to the phases of healing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory phase (0 to 72 hours after injury)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Reparative/fibroblastic</span> phase (72 hours to 3 weeks after injury)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Maturation/remodeling</span> phase (3 weeks to 2 years after injury)</p><p/><p>How and when a modality, manipulation, or exercise is deployed is guided by the type of injury and tissue response to physiologic demand and by the signs and symptoms of the stages of the healing process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65458\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65458 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The discussion that follows assumes that fractures and joint instability have been excluded.

Some of these modalities also may be necessary during subsequent phases of rehabilitation, particularly if pain and swelling increase during therapeutic exercise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Protection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Protection of the injured area prevents further tissue damage. Examples of protective modalities include crutches, padding, shock-absorbing insoles, and external supports (eg, air stirrup brace) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. In addition, protection includes a graduated return to play progression to help reduce the risk of reinjury due to tissue overload that exceeds the rate of tissue repair.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Relative rest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relative, rather than complete, rest is prescribed during the inflammatory phase. Immobilization of the injured joint or musculotendinous unit should be local and of short duration. Properly dosed exercise and activities of daily living can protect ligaments and joint soft tissues as long as the force is not too great and does not result in swelling or pain at the affected site. Pain and swelling are the body's response to overloading a tissue's ability to accommodate a particular load. Sudden return to high-level training without adequate proprioceptive training increases the likelihood of ligament injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Immobility is deleterious because it causes a net shift in ligament cell metabolism from homeostasis to a catabolic state. Immobilization results in bone resorption and focal weakening at the insertion sites of ligaments and tendons, with concomitant decreased strength and stiffness of connective tissue. After six to nine weeks of immobilization, the connective tissues lose one-half of their previous strength and stiffness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Disuse of tendons leads to loss of tissue volume and formation of cross-links [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. The resulting tissue is weak and fails at &le;60 percent of its previous strain-to-failure rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cold therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cold therapy is commonly used during the inflammatory and early reparative phase (ie, up to seven days after injury) to decrease swelling and pain. The benefits of cold therapy have been demonstrated with magnetic resonance imaging of the perfusion of muscle tissue and diffusion of water molecules following cryotherapy wherein tissue temperature and perfusion were both noted to be significantly reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Cryotherapy has been demonstrated to have effects on acute injury including decreased pain, decreased swelling, and increased range of motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, the early observational studies demonstrating the benefit of cryotherapy in patients with ankle sprain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>] were of limited methodological rigor and it remains unclear if cryotherapy improves functional outcomes significantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>It is important to explain correct usage of cold therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Ice application should begin immediately postinjury. Ice packs (crushed ice and water in a plastic bag) should be applied directly to the skin. Some experts suggest that ice be applied continuously for 20 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]; others suggest that it be applied in two 10-minute sessions separated by a 10-minute break [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Application of ice three to four times per day is considered sufficient, but cold therapy can be performed every hour; the more frequent the application, the greater the chance of effectively reducing the inflammatory process.

The addition of pain-free range of motion may increase lymphatic drainage 5 to 15 times the resting level, hastening restoration of fluid balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The combination of compression and ice is more effective in controlling edema than is compression alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>The benefits of compression were demonstrated in a trial in which noninjured subjects were randomly assigned to use or not use an elbow sleeve after eccentric muscle exercise (exercise that opposes gravity and acts to lengthen muscles) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Use of the compression sleeve was associated with reduced delayed-onset muscle soreness, decreased loss of strength, decreased swelling, improved resting joint angle, increased ability to perform daily tasks, decreased perception of soreness, and decreased levels of serum creatine kinase.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapies to avoid</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Heat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that heat therapy be avoided during the inflammatory phase of rehabilitation.

In observational studies of patients with ankle sprain, application of heat was associated with delayed recovery compared with application of cold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical therapy prescription</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When writing a prescription for physical therapy for a patient in the inflammatory phase, the prescription should reflect the principles described above (ie, protection of the injured area, properly dosed exercise, and application of various modalities to reduce edema) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65458\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65458 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">REPARATIVE PHASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reparative phase (approximately three days to three weeks after injury) of rehabilitation begins after inflammation is controlled, when swelling and spasms decrease or subside and the injured area can be moved with little to no pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>An example of a patient in the reparative phase is a boy who presents one week after an ankle sprain and has mild discomfort, but whose overall pain is improved. He still has pain with activities of daily living, walks with a small limp, and, subjectively, cannot return to exercise or sports.

In setting goals for physical therapy, it is useful to know the range of motion requirements for various activities. As an example, the knee range of motion requirements for walking, stairs, cycling, and jogging are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Walking without a limp &ndash; Flexion of 75 degrees</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stair climbing and cycling &ndash; Flexion of 90 degrees</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jogging or running &ndash; Flexion of 105 to 120 degrees</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sprinting &ndash; Flexion of 140 degrees</p><p/><p>It is necessary to have 5 to 10 more degrees of static flexion than listed above to achieve the smooth function of dynamic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In patients with soft-tissue adhesions or contracture of muscles or joints, myofascial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> joint manipulation is required to regain full range of motion, including osteokinematic (gross movements of bones at joints, such as <span class=\"nowrap\">flexion/extension)</span> and arthrokinematic (movements of joint surfaces, such as gliding) motion.

Restricted joint motion decreases the working surface area of the joint, increasing the force per unit area and contributing to greater wear and early fatigue failure of structures in and about the affected joint. Myofascial stiffness can be improved with muscular manipulation or stretching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Muscular length can be increased with static or dynamic flexibility activities.</p><p>Static flexibility is the physical actual muscle length that allows range of motion about a joint assuming normal arthrokinematics. To achieve static flexibility, static stretching is conducted by placing the affected muscle-tendon unit in an anatomically lengthened position. Low-load, long-duration (30 to 60 second) stretches are preferred to shorter duration fast stretches for lengthening myofascial structures according to known tissue mechanical properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/22,27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,27-31</a>].</p><p>Dynamic flexibility is the ability to use the full range of motion of a joint by overcoming resistance during performance of an activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The load must match the strain tolerance of healing collagen without disrupting the immature fiber matrix. Pain is a sign that the load is excessive and must be reduced.</p><p>In a patient with a partial thickness tear of the Achilles' tendon, for example, if pain occurs with single-limb load-bearing exercise, double-limb load-bearing exercise can be used. If there is pain on two legs, the load can be reduced through a variable inclined plane or aquatic exercise. These adaptations enable the patient to exercise at as little as 3 percent of body weight up to &ge;70 percent of body weight. Over the course of weeks, the plantar flexion load is progressively increased until the activity demand is met by the healing tissue, permitting a pain-free return to sports activity.</p><p>Identification of appropriate load is accomplished by selecting exercises that are specific to the injured muscle tendon unit and allowing the patient to reach fatigue between 20 and 30 repetitions of the exercise without pain provocation. Each phase of the progression adds a degree of challenge to the maturing tissue when it has met the previous stage's goal.</p><p>Progressive loading can be done by increasing the percentage of body weight for which the patient is responsible, increasing the resistance applied, or speeding up the movement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As an example, an athlete who begins at a load tolerance of 50 percent of his body weight before provocation of familiar pain may be progressed to 60 percent when sets of 30 or more repetitions can be performed at 50 percent of body weight without pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Strength</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of strength is a primary step in rehabilitation. Strengthening exercises should be as functional or sport-specific as possible and should be progressed from general strength to specific strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, to achieve the premorbid sports level, core strengthening of the lumbo-pelvic muscular stabilizers also may be necessary.</p><p>In the progression of strengthening exercises, it is important to involve concentric and eccentric strengthening, isometrics, isotonics, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, and stretch-shortening cycle activities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66164\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66164 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Closed-chain exercises are an excellent way to include all these phases of strengthening. Closed-chain exercises are performed with the distal segment of an extremity fixed and with motion occurring at the proximal segments. Examples of closed-chain exercises for the lower extremity include partial squats, leg presses, single leg load bearing balance with or without perturbation, step-ups, lunges, stair climbers, lateral slide boards, treadmills, the use of a biomechanical ankle platform system (BAPS) board, mini-trampolines, and Dyna Discs.</p><p>Working in closed-chain contexts provides functional deceleration training for large lower-extremity muscle groups and enhances speed, balance, and coordination. Closed-chain exercises increase joint stability through a larger range of motion and enhanced muscle action around the joint. However, closed kinetic chain exercises should be augmented by open chain exercises where deemed appropriate by the treating therapist because the addition of open kinetic chain exercise to a closed kinetic chain regimen improves outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Muscular endurance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muscular endurance is the capacity of muscle to perform repetitive contractions against a load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Endurance is compromised after injury and immobilization because there is a preferential loss of type I muscle fibers (also known as slow-twitch, red, or oxidative endurance-biased muscle fibers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. During rehabilitation, it takes longer to regain muscular endurance than muscular strength.</p><p>Endurance can be obtained via high-repetition, low-load exercises. A level of muscular discomfort but not familiar pain should be reached at 20 repetitions of the assigned weight. The speed of movement or the load should be decreased if muscular discomfort is felt before 20 repetitions. The speed or load should be increased if the muscle is not fatigued within 30 repetitions in one set.</p><p>Exercises should be performed daily with progression until symptoms are gone and full load-bearing is achieved with sport-specific weights. As the resistance increases, a greater stress is placed on the tissues and recovery from training efforts may take longer than 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This increase in recovery time may require a decrease in training frequency to three days per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. It may take 2 to 16 weeks to achieve the goal of increased strength (average six weeks).

Maintaining cardiovascular endurance helps to minimize the time away from sport. The athlete may return to sports without delay when the rehabilitation goals for the injured tissue have been met if cardiovascular endurance is maintained during rehabilitation.</p><p>Cardiovascular endurance can be maintained via cross-training (eg, aqua jogging, upper-extremity bikes, gait-unloading devices). Runners can maintain maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max) and two-mile run performance similar to that achieved with running through cycling or aqua jogging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Power</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Power is the ability of muscle to exert a large amount of force at a fast rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/5,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,48,49</a>]. Increased power requires increased strength or rate of muscle shortening.</p><p>To improve power with training, exercise should occur at 30 to 60 percent of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Training at 30 to 60 percent MVC increases both force and velocity (and thus power), whereas training at 100 percent MVC improves force, but not velocity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Plyometric activities, which use the stretch-shortening cycle to get a greater force of contraction, increase power by requiring the muscle to change from eccentric to concentric action quickly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-rehabilitation-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. They also may help develop reciprocal reflexes to help prevent injuries.

The phases of rehabilitation correspond to the phases of healing: inflammatory (0 to 72 hours after injury), reparative (72 hours to 3 weeks after injury), and maturation (3 weeks to 2 years after injury). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management during the inflammatory phase focuses on PRICE: <strong>P</strong>rotection of the injured area, <strong>R</strong>elative rest, and decreasing swelling through <strong>I</strong>ce, <strong>C</strong>ompression, and <strong>E</strong>levation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Inflammatory phase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest cold therapy during the inflammatory phase of sports injuries (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
