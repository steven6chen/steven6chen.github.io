It is through use of standardized nomenclature that physicians can more accurately codify the symptomatology, treatment, and outcome of patients with uterine anomalies. Unfortunately, there is no universally accepted and interpreted classification system for uterine anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the European Society for Gynaecological Endoscopy (ESGE) published a classification system in 2013 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95637%7EOBGYN%2F96927\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95637 graphicRef96927 \">figure 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American Fertility Society in 1988 produced a standard form for classification of m&uuml;llerian defects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76124\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76124 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81036\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81036 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Uterine anomalies occur in 2 to 4 percent of fertile women with normal reproductive outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/5-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-11</a>]. In one of the better designed studies, the uteri of 679 women with normal reproductive outcomes were evaluated with laparoscopy or laparotomy prior to tubal ligation, and then by follow-up hysterosalpingogram (HSG) five months after sterilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The type and frequency of abnormality were septate uteri (90 percent), bicornuate uterus (5 percent), and didelphic uterus (5 percent).</p><p>The prevalence is higher among women with adverse reproductive outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]. As an example, the incidence of mullerian anomalies among women with recurrent first trimester miscarriage or late first trimester-second trimester <span class=\"nowrap\">miscarriage/preterm</span> delivery was 5 to 10 percent and greater than 25 percent, respectively, in another study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Women with primary infertility have about the same prevalence of congenital uterine anomalies as fertile women with normal reproductive outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Frequency of specific anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A review including a combined population of infertile and fertile women, the frequency of anomalies by type was: septate (35 percent), bicornuate (26 percent), arcuate (18 percent), unicornuate (10 percent), didelphys (8 percent), and agenesis (3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Variable uterine development may result in lateral hemi-uteri or uterine horns, a midline uterus without a cervix, or no uterine structures at all. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of congenital anomalies of the vagina&quot;, section on 'Vaginal agenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Lateral fusion defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lateral fusion defects are the most common type of m&uuml;llerian defect. The resulting organs are either symmetric or asymmetric, and obstructed or nonobstructed. These fusion defects result from failure of formation of one m&uuml;llerian duct, migration of a duct, fusion of the m&uuml;llerian ducts, or absorption of the intervening septum. Defective resorption of the tissue between the fused m&uuml;llerian ducts results in a uterine septum, which may extend either partially down the uterus or the full length to the cervix. A septum is the most common type of uterine defect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Septate/arcuate uterus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A septate uterus has a normal external surface but two endometrial cavities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60684\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60684 \">figure 3</a>), in contrast to a bicornuate uterus (see below) which has an indented fundus and two endometrial cavities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53703\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53703 \">figure 4</a>). The septate uterus develops from a defect in canalization or resorption of the midline septum between the two m&uuml;llerian ducts. The degree of septation varies from a small midline septum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60684\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60684 \">figure 3</a>) to total failure in resorption resulting in a septate uterus with longitudinal vaginal septum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63396%7EOBGYN%2F75163\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63396 graphicRef75163 \">figure 5A-B</a>). Partial and complete uterine septa are defined by the proximity of the septum to the internal os; the presence or absence of a complete or partial vaginal septum is not relevant to the classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>An arcuate uterus has a slight midline septum with minimal, and often broad, fundal cavity indentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53338\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53338 \">figure 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79328\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79328 \">image 1</a>); it has been variously classified as a septate uterus, bicornuate uterus, or normal variant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>There appears to be a higher risk of recurrent miscarriage associated with longer septa, but this is controversial and many untreated women have good pregnancy outcomes. Pregnancy outcomes reported in such women revealed spontaneous abortion in 21-44 percent, preterm delivery in 12-33 percent, and live birth in 50-72 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Surgical repair with resection of the septum hysteroscopically, or hysteroscopic metroplasty, provides excellent posttreatment results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

One cavity is usually normal, with a fallopian tube and cervix, while the failed m&uuml;llerian duct has various configurations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78813%7EOBGYN%2F73807%7EOBGYN%2F61993%7EOBGYN%2F73768%7EOBGYN%2F50733\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78813 graphicRef73807 graphicRef61993 graphicRef73768 graphicRef50733 \">figure 8A-E</a>). The affected m&uuml;llerian duct may not develop at all, or it may develop only partially as either a rudimentary horn on the uterus or an anlage (a cluster of embryonic cells). This horn or anlage may or may not communicate with the uterus. Although most rudimentary horns are asymptomatic, others contain functional, but not necessarily normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], endometrium that is shed cyclically. If the rudimentary horn is obstructed (without communication to the other uterus or cervix), the women may develop cyclic or chronic abdominopelvic pain and may require surgical excision of the obstructed horn. In a literature review, the mean age of presentation was the mid 20s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>A review of pregnancy outcomes in unicornuate uteri reported that, although unicornuate uteri occurs in 1:4020 women in the general population, it is more common in infertile women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, women with unicornuate uteri had the following rates of obstetric complications: 2.7 percent ectopic pregnancy, 24.3 percent first trimester abortion, 9.7 percent second trimester abortion, 20.1 percent preterm delivery, 3.8 percent intrauterine fetal demise, and 51.5 percent live births.</p><p>Unicornuate uterus can be associated with an ectopic ovary, which is of clinical importance in women undergoing ovulation induction or who develop ovarian neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Ectopic ovaries have been identified using magnetic resonance imaging.</p><p>The kidneys should be evaluated sonographically if a unicornuate uterus is noted because of the high incidence (40 percent) of associated renal abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Women with a unicornuate uterus are at higher risk for infertility, endometriosis, premature labor, and breech presentations (see <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Obstetrical complications'</a> below)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Bicornuate uterus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A bicornuate uterus refers to a uterus in which the fundus is indented (arbitrarily defined as &ge;1 cm) and the vagina is generally normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This anomaly results from only partial fusion of the m&uuml;llerian ducts. This leads to a variable degree of separation of the uterine horns that can be complete (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53703\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53703 \">figure 4</a>), partial (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82622\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82622 \">figure 9</a>), or minimal (ie, the arcuate uterus merely has an indentation at the center of the fundus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Pregnancy outcomes have been reported to be close to those of the general population. However, some women do develop complications, such as pregnancy loss, preterm labor, or malpresentations (see <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Obstetrical complications'</a> below)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Surgical treatment requires uterine reunification through a laparotomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Uterine didelphys</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine didelphys, or double uterus, occurs when the two m&uuml;llerian ducts fail to fuse, thus producing duplication of the reproductive structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77029%7EOBGYN%2F55525\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77029 graphicRef55525 \">figure 10A-B</a>). Generally the duplication is limited to the uterus and cervix (uterine didelphys and bicollis [two cervices]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60361%7EOBGYN%2F76867%7EOBGYN%2F62754\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60361 graphicRef76867 graphicRef62754 \">picture 1A-C</a>), although duplication of the vulva, bladder, urethra, vagina, and anus may also occur. Fifteen to 20 percent of women with didelphic uterus also have unilateral anomalies, such as an obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal agenesis; the anomalies are on the right in 65 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Women with a didelphic uterus and bicollis often have good reproductive outcomes. A septated vagina occurs in 75 percent of cases and may cause difficulty with sexual intercourse or vaginal delivery. Affected women may opt for resection of the vaginal septum. Metroplasty should be considered for women with pelvic pain, recurrent miscarriages, or a history of preterm delivery.</p><p>Women with an obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal <span class=\"nowrap\">agenesis/anomaly</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76524\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76524 \">figure 11</a>) will have regular menses because menstrual blood from one uterus can egress through its nonobstructed cervix and hemivagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, such patients will most likely develop cyclic pain due to build up of blood in the obstructed hemivagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, there may be a microcommunication between the patent vagina and the obstructed vagina resulting in an infected obstructed hemivagina. Treatment involves resection of the wall of the obstructed vagina followed by creation of a single vaginal vault. Bilateral obstruction is also possible, and presents with primary amenorrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65261\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65261 \">figure 12</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Vertical fusion defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vertical fusion defects are due to either defective fusion of the caudal end of the m&uuml;llerian duct and urogenital sinus or problems with vaginal canalization. The resulting vaginal septum or cervical agenesis or dysgenesis may be obstructed or nonobstructed. The amount of obstruction will determine symptomatology, including obstetric outcomes.

Therefore, all women with m&uuml;llerian defects should undergo a radiologic renal investigation, such as an intravenous pyelogram or renal ultrasound.</p><p>Ipsilateral renal agenesis is invariably noted with obstructive m&uuml;llerian defects. Obstruction may occur in a unicornuate uterus with a functioning, noncommunicating horn; an obstructed cavity in one of the double uteri; or with a vaginal septum leading to obstruction.

The first film should be taken after injection of a small amount of dye (eg, 2 mL) to look for small filling defects, such as polyps and fibroids. In general, hysterosalpingograms are performed after menses in the follicular phase to minimize the possibility of an early pregnancy. The best images are obtained using fluoroscopy with image intensification, by positioning the uterus axially, by withdrawing the speculum so as not to obscure the cervix, and by not injecting too much or too little dye.</p><p>A nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> 600 to 800 mg) should be taken one hour prior to the procedure to diminish patient discomfort and prophylactic antibiotics are administered (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> 100 mg BID for three days starting the day prior to the procedure) to reduce the risk of infection.</p><p>Hysterosalpingography is an excellent method of evaluating the uterine cavity to assist in diagnosis of a uterine anomaly.
