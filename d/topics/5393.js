It is thought that the bone formation that is distinctive of DISH results from abnormal osteoblastic differentiation and activity at the enthesis.</p><p>Natural inhibitors of bone formation, such as matrix Gla protein and Dickkopf-1, may be deficient in DISH patients, contributing to hyperostosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. An appropriate genetic background, as yet unidentified, external factors, or local or systemic factors may stimulate the abnormal osteoblastic differentiation.</p><p>Potentially important factors include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mechanical factors</strong> &ndash; Bony bridging is usually more prominent on the right side of the thoracic spine in patients with DISH, but mechanical factors associated with the location of the aorta may affect the development of bony outgrowths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In comparison with the usual right-sided prominence, those with DISH and dextrocardia or situs inversus have more extensive bony bridging on the left side of the thoracic spine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) of the spine, a condition that can occur with DISH or as an independent entity, ligamentous stretching can increase prostaglandin I2 synthase, resulting in stimulation of osteogenic differentiation and suggesting a mechanism whereby mechanical forces may affect bone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Circulating levels of Dickkopf-1, an inhibitor of osteoblastogenesis, may be reduced in DISH patients, contributing to hyperostosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A case-control study that reported no significant difference in the amount of heavy work performed by persons with DISH than by control individuals fails to support the mechanical hypothesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, work as a measure of mechanical loading of bones and joints is notoriously difficult to accurately assess.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Environmental factors and diet</strong> &ndash; Several known environmental causes of hyperostosis have been investigated as possible contributors to the development of DISH, including exposure to fluoride and to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a>. In one study, fluoride levels in both the water and air were measured in towns inhabited by 11 patients with DISH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Based upon the levels of fluoride, chronic fluoride intoxication was unlikely to be causative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The relationship between prolonged exposure to an excess of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> and bone hyperostosis is established. However, while higher serum levels of retinol have been reported in DISH patients compared with normal controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], this has not been confirmed by all investigators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medications</strong> &ndash; Selected medications may also drive hyperostosis. Long-term therapy of acne and other skin conditions with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a>, a synthetic derivative of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a>, is associated with hyperostotic changes in the spine. Etretinate (no longer available for clinical use), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a>, and other synthetic retinoids are associated with hyperostosis, particularly at extraspinal sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. As noted in the previous section, however, increased exposure to vitamin A alone does not appear to be adequate to cause DISH.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Metabolic conditions</strong> &ndash; Several growth factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of DISH, including insulin, insulin-like growth factor, and growth hormone. Insulin-like growth factor 1 stimulates osteoblasts, and growth hormone can induce the local production of insulin-like growth factor 1 in osteoblasts. It is believed that these factors are involved in the pathogenesis of the increased osteoblastic activity in DISH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/3,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While individual studies evaluating levels of glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1, and growth hormone have produced conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], some confirmation of their importance comes from clinical studies. As an example, the Pima Native American people have a high frequency of DISH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. They also have a high prevalence of obesity, elevated blood pressure, adult-onset diabetes mellitus, and hyperinsulinemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additionally, in Caucasian populations, the prevalence of DISH is increased in obese persons and possibly in those with early obesity or diabetes mellitus, conditions in which increased levels of insulin are likely present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/16,17,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,19,20</a>]. Features of DISH are also found in up to 20 percent of those with acromegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Elevated levels of insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1, and growth hormone have been reported in some studies of DISH patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/15,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hypervascularity of ossified ligaments and involved vertebrae has been described. Whether this causes osteoblast proliferation or is a result of DISH is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other growth factors and regulatory molecules may also play a role in DISH. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB and transforming growth factor-1-beta in ligament cells may lead to increased levels of nuclear factor kappa B in DISH. Nuclear factor kappa B can cause undifferentiated mesenchymal cells to differentiate into osteoblasts, providing a plausible mechanism for bony proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Matrix Gla protein likely inhibits bone formation. The apparently paradoxical finding of higher levels of matrix Gla in persons with DISH compared with controls suggests a possible role for this protein in the disease process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is more common in men than women. The incidence varies by population and increases with age, rarely being diagnosed before the age of 40.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a population-based study of individuals over age 30 in Finland, the incidence was 0.7 and 0.4 per 100 person-years in men and women, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In another Finnish study, the prevalence in people over 40 years of age was 3.8 and 2.6 percent in men and women, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Among those over age 70, the prevalence was 10.1 and 6.8 percent. In a study in Hungary, the prevalence in those over 50 years was 4.9 percent in men and 1.4 percent in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Pima Native American people in Arizona of the United States have a particularly high prevalence of DISH, occurring in 25 and 4.7 percent of men and women aged 15 years and over, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]; this rises to 48 and 12 percent in those over the age of 55 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>American blacks may have a lower prevalence of DISH than whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospital-based studies may report a higher prevalence of disease than population-based studies, since DISH is more likely among those seeking or requiring hospital care. A hospital-based study of 1500 African blacks found a radiographic prevalence of approximately 4 percent in both males and females over age 40 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A similar study among a hospitalized Jewish population living in Jerusalem found a prevalence of 22.4 and 13.4 percent in males and females over age 40, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Japan, up to 4 percent of the general population have ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), predominantly at the cervical spine, a prevalence that is nearly 80-fold that seen in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) may experience musculoskeletal pain and stiffness in affected areas, including the neck, back, and sometimes the extremities; experience reduced spinal motion, especially in the thoracic spine, which is present in all patients in advanced cases; and demonstrate characteristic radiographic changes, including ossification of paravertebral ligaments and peripheral entheses. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Physical findings'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> below.)</p><p>Laboratory findings are typically unremarkable, and whether DISH is associated with other musculoskeletal or systemic disorders is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Associated conditions'</a> below.)</p><p>Because most reports of the clinical features of DISH are based upon clinic or hospital series, individuals evaluated in these studies are more likely to be symptomatic than those in population-based surveys.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with DISH may have neck, thoracic spine, low back, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extremity pain and experience restricted spinal mobility. Dysphagia, airway obstruction, and other symptoms related to spinal involvement are also reported, as are myelopathy-related symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Musculoskeletal symptoms</strong> &ndash; Spinal morning stiffness, a symptom usually associated with inflammatory disorders of the spine, is present in a large number of affected individuals (80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Pain may be reported in the neck, mid- and low back, and the extremities. In one study in which the symptoms were compared among patients with either DISH or lumbar spondylosis and healthy controls, substantially higher levels of pain over the neck, thoracic spine, low back, and extremities were reported in those with DISH than in healthy persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Disability as assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire was also greater in those with DISH than in healthy subjects. In one study of community dwellers in southern California, those with DISH had 1.7-fold greater odds of self-reported difficulty bending, had worse grip strength, and men were less likely to complete five chair stands without using their arms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Among those with DISH or symptomatic lumbar spondylosis, there were similar degrees of pain, disability, and diminution in global well-being. Radicular pain is not a feature of DISH itself, and its presence suggests the likelihood of an associated nerve impingement in the spine. Patients with DISH may also suffer from lumbar spinal stenosis unrelated to DISH.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The frequency of complaints among those with DISH varies by the site of discomfort. Pain in the thoracic spine, for example, has been reported to occur among 40 to 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/1,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16</a>]. By comparison, complaints of dysphagia and symptoms in the shoulder, elbow, and knee due to enthesopathy are less common, being reported in approximately 15 to 25 percent of patients. Stridor may rarely occur when large anterior osteophytes arise from C2 to C3; odynophagia and otalgia may result from pressure-induced hypopharyngeal ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some patients complain of symptoms for years prior to diagnosis; some, but not all, studies suggest a link between radiologic findings at a particular site and the presence of symptoms attributed to the abnormality (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> below). In one study of hospitalized patients, for example, a significant association was reported between shoulder hyperostosis and shoulder symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A near doubling of risk for elbow symptoms was also reported in those with elbow hyperostosis (but it did not reach statistical significance) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, unlike the studies cited earlier, no appreciable link was noted between axial hyperostosis and spinal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In another study, a comparison of 56 patients with DISH and 43 patients with a history of chronic low back pain and moderate to severe radiographic lumbar spondylosis reported at least a fourfold increase in the frequency of medial epicondylitis, knee enthesitis, plantar fasciitis, and dysphagia in those with DISH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, none of these increases was statistically significant, each affecting only five to seven patients compared with a single affected spondylosis patient with each.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dysphagia and other symptoms with cervical involvement</strong> &ndash; An increase in the frequency of dysphagia has been noted in all series. This sometimes results from compression of the esophagus by large anterior cervical osteophytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/1,2,16,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,16,31</a>]. Cervical involvement can also cause hoarseness, stridor, aspiration pneumonia, sleep apnea, atlantoaxial subluxation or pseudoarthrosis, and thoracic outlet syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic manifestations</strong> &ndash; Neurologic complaints or findings may occur due to ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), which can result in spinal cord compression and may lead to sensory or motor disturbances due to myelopathy. This condition is more prevalent among patients of Asian descent with DISH. OPLL can cause cervical myelopathy with potentially devastating neurologic complications, including quadriparesis and quadriplegia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Symptoms that should raise concerns for the development of cervical myelopathy include the development of sharp, shooting pain in the neck; the sudden loss of cervical spine motion; the presence of an unsteady gait and brisk reflexes; and the development of new sensory symptoms in the extremities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other complications that are rare include Horner's syndrome, recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, and vertebral artery insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decreased range of spinal motion, particularly thoracic movement, is the most common finding upon physical examination. Although all spinal motion is diminished in DISH, the loss of thoracic lateral flexion is particularly notable. Palpable nodules may also be found at the entheses, with the elbow, knee, and Achilles region being the most common sites.</p><p>An increased prevalence of Bouchard and Heberden nodes in those with DISH compared with age- and sex-matched controls without DISH was noted in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]; a similar finding relating to Heberden nodes was noted in a second report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmarks of DISH are radiographic abnormalities. DISH is characterized on imaging by the ossification of paravertebral ligaments and peripheral entheses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/1,2,8,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8,40-42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Spinal involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common and characteristic radiographic findings involve the thoracic spine, but abnormalities may also be present in the cervical and lumbosacral spine.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thoracic</strong> &ndash; In the thoracic spine, the distinctive finding is flowing linear calcification and ossification along the anterolateral aspects of the vertebral bodies, which continue across the disc space. When present, a lucent area is noted between the anterior longitudinal ligament and the mid-portion of the vertebral body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Thoracic involvement is usually more prominent on the right side of the spine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F68698\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68698 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/2,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,41</a>]. These findings may be more readily visualized on the lateral radiographic images.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cervical</strong> &ndash; In the cervical spine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F75500\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75500 \">image 2</a>), hyperostosis occurs initially on the anterior surface of the vertebral body, particularly the inferior lip of the vertebra so that a downward-pointing spur arises. Changes are most common in the lower cervical spine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The cervical spine hyperostosis is often symmetrically distributed anterior to the vertebral body, which may cause substantial displacement of the trachea and the esophagus. Unlike the thoracic spine, ossifications are nonflowing in the sagittal view [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lumbar</strong> &ndash; In the lumbar spine, the findings are similar to those of the cervical spine, except that there may be a tendency for the spurs to point upwards.

Both patterns were observed concomitantly in 15 patients. The authors noted that vertically oriented osteophytes were frequent and hypothesized that they may indicate an inflammatory pathogenesis, in contrast to horizontally oriented osteophytes that may be more characteristic of osteoarthritic change.

These findings typically include flowing linear calcification and ossification along the anterolateral aspects of the vertebral bodies, most often affecting the thoracic spine, which continue across the disc space (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Spinal involvement'</a> above). In most patients, at least two contiguous vertebrae are involved and the disc space height in affected areas is largely preserved.</p><p>Lateral radiographs of the thoracic spine should generally be obtained as the initial diagnostic test. In patients who have previous chest radiographs available for review, such studies may be sufficient to confirm the diagnosis. Additional radiographic studies may be necessary for those with clinical features suggesting cervical, lumbar, or extraspinal involvement. The incidental finding of spinal ligament calcification or ossification should alert the clinician to the possibility of a diagnosis of DISH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classification criteria for DISH have been proposed by Resnick and Niwayama, and Utsinger has recommended different criteria for epidemiologic purposes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F60298\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60298 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/1,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,40</a>]. Despite the common use of elements of classification criteria as aids in diagnosis, such criteria sets have limitations when employed for that purpose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. As examples, the Resnick criteria rely solely upon axial radiographic findings (involvement of at least four contiguous vertebral bodies) and do not include changes present in the peripheral skeleton; the criteria of Utsinger rely comparatively less on radiographic changes (involvement of at least two contiguous vertebral bodies supports &quot;probable DISH&quot;) and thus may be more suitable for identifying patients with earlier disease.</p><p>An important part of both sets of criteria is that the findings included have to be differentiated from those in other diseases. The absence of structural changes in the sacroiliac joints and of apophyseal joint bony ankyloses helps exclude typical ankylosing spondylitis, and the maintenance of intervertebral disc height helps to exclude typical of degenerative disc disease.</p><p>For screening or epidemiologic studies, a chest radiograph may be used, which will detect at least 75 percent of those with DISH as defined by Resnick's criteria. However, patients with less extensive radiographic disease but with skeletal changes consistent with DISH may remain undetected using these criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of conditions may produce spinal bony excrescences similar to those observed with diffuse idiopathic hyperostosis (DISH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F58056\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58056 \">table 3</a>).

In many patients, DISH remains an asymptomatic finding noted on radiographs. In a small percentage of patients, there may be complications including the development of spinal fractures through ankylosed bone that may constitute a neurosurgical emergency. Patients with DISH undergoing upper gastrointestinal or airway procedures may be at higher risk for the development of complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &quot;patient info&quot; and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basics topic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a noninflammatory disease, with the principal manifestation being calcification and ossification of spinal ligaments and of peripheral entheses. Radiographic changes characteristic of DISH may occur in the absence of any musculoskeletal symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiology and pathogenesis of DISH remain obscure. Possible roles for mechanical factors, dietary components, metabolic disorders, medications, and a genetic predisposition have been suggested. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of DISH varies with the population studied. It is particularly high among the Pima Native American people of the United States, is more common in men than women, and is less common in blacks than Caucasians. The prevalence increases with age. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the region of the thoracic spine is a common complaint, present in 40 to 80 percent of patients. Morning stiffness, often considered a symptom of inflammatory back pain, may also be present. Dysphagia sometimes results from impingement of cervical osteophytes upon the pharynx. Ossification of the posterior spinal ligament in the cervical spine may cause spinal cord compression, leading to cervical myelopathy. There are no diagnostic physical findings, but limited motion of the thoracic spine is the most commonly reported abnormality. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Physical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The distinctive radiographic finding is flowing linear calcification and ossification along the anterolateral aspects of the vertebral bodies, which continue across the disc space of the thoracic spine. Anatomically, these involve the paravertebral ligaments. Calcification or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) arises almost solely in the cervical spine and is better visualized with computed tomography (CT) scanning than with plain film radiographs. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar calcification and ossification may be seen at peripheral entheseal sites, including the shoulder, iliac crest, ischial tuberosity, trochanters of the hip (whiskering), tibial tuberosities, patellae, and bones of the hands <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> feet. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Extraspinal involvement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical diagnosis of DISH is made on the basis of compatible radiographic findings, which are most readily identified in the thoracic spine. The differential diagnosis includes spondylosis deformans (cervical or lumbar spondylosis) and ankylosing spondylitis, and these are distinguished by the absence of longitudinal spinal ligamentous calcification in the former and by the presence of slender, nearly vertical syndesmophytes in the latter. Unlike DISH, patients with degenerative disc disease can exhibit reduced intervertebral disc heights and those with ankylosing spondylitis can show structural changes in the sacroiliac joints and may have ankyloses of the apophyseal joints. (See <a href=\"#H385527522\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of DISH is symptomatic. In patients with symptomatic complaints, such as pain or stiffness, and those with restricted spinal motion, we suggest physical therapy evaluation and management, with the use of therapeutic modalities (eg, heat, ultrasound, exercises, and, if needed, modification of activities of daily living) and orthotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We encourage all patients to remain active. (See <a href=\"#H4159325693\" class=\"local\">'Treatment overview'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1011959295\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with pain and stiffness that do not respond adequately to physical measures, we suggest using the same approach to pharmacotherapy as in subacute and chronic low back pain (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Typically this may involve occasional use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> for mild pain and of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for moderate pain and for peripheral joint symptoms of pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stiffness. (See <a href=\"#H1011959295\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Painful enthesopathy that is not adequately controlled by oral agents may respond to local injections of glucocorticoids. Surgery is occasionally required for dysphagia due to cervical spurs, for cervical myelopathy due to ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and for other rare neurologic manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H1681625706\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgical consultation'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-idiopathic-skeletal-hyperostosis-dish/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Utsinger PD.
