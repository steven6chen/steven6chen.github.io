It is generally regarded as a form of spondyloarthritis (SpA).</p><p>The definition, clinical features, approach to diagnosis and differential diagnosis, and management of reactive arthritis will be reviewed here. Mechanisms that may play a role in reactive arthritis and in other spondyloarthritides are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of spondyloarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27140925\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &ldquo;reactive arthritis&rdquo; was introduced in 1969 as &ldquo;an arthritis which developed soon after or during an infection elsewhere in the body, but in which the microorganisms cannot be recovered from the joint&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The original definition did not specify the pathogens that were accepted as causes of reactive arthritis, and, in 1999, a panel of experts determined a specific list of gastrointestinal and urogenital pathogens that could be considered causative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These included <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>, <em>Yersinia</em>, <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Shigella</em>, and <em>Campylobacter</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Clostridium difficile</em>, and <em>Chlamydia pneumoniae</em> have since been added to the list [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>].</p><p>Additional causative pathogens, alternative terms, and diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for reactive arthritis have subsequently been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, none of the newer diagnostic or therapeutic approaches or alternate names has been adequately validated. Another problem is that many of the studies generating these approaches involved patients seen in rheumatology clinics or followed outbreaks of disease after exposure to a common pathogen; such patients are not likely to be representative of the affected patients in the general community. Thus, the definition of reactive arthritis is still evolving.</p><p>Two major clinical features that characterize reactive arthritis were identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An interval ranging from several days to weeks between the antecedent infection and arthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A typically mono- or oligoarticular pattern of the arthritis, often involving the lower extremities, and sometimes associated with dactylitis and enthesitis</p><p/><p>By convention, reactive arthritis of more than six months&rsquo; duration was regarded as being chronic instead of acute.</p><p>The term &ldquo;reactive arthritis&rdquo; has sometimes been used historically to refer to the clinical triad of postinfectious arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis, which was formerly called Reiter syndrome. However, these patients represent only a subset of patients with reactive arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>Patients suspected of having reactive arthritis whose features initially or subsequently satisfy the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria for axial or peripheral spondyloarthritis (SpA) are also considered as having a form of SpA. A preceding episode of genital or gastrointestinal infection is included among the ASAS criteria that may support a diagnosis of peripheral SpA and the inclusion of a patient with reactive arthritis in this group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reactive arthritis is a relatively rare disease that typically occurs in young adults, affecting both men and women. Studies of the prevalence and annual incidence of reactive arthritis are highly heterogeneous with respect to the size of the cohort, collection of data, the definition of reactive arthritis, and the identification of the inducing pathogens. In a US population-based study in Oregon and Minnesota, the incidence of reactive arthritis following documented enteric bacterial infections ranged from 0.6 to 3.1 cases per 100,000, depending upon the organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. An analysis of the data in a 2013 systematic review found that the incidence of reactive arthritis following infection with <em>Campylobacter</em>, <em>Salmonella</em>, and <em>Shigella</em>, was estimated as 9, 12, and 12 per 1,000 patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Similarly, the annual incidence of reactive arthritis among children in three pediatric health networks in the United States with <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection was estimated at 14 per 1000 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Globally, the annual incidence has been reported between 0.6 to 27 per 100,000, and the prevalence is estimated to be 30 to 40 per 100,000 adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/3,4,6,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,6,14</a>]. </p><p>Among patients with any of the spondyloarthritis (SpA) variants seen by rheumatologists, those with reactive arthritis are a small minority. This was illustrated by two registry-based studies from Spain in which 1.2 to 1.4 percent of all patients with SpA had been diagnosed with reactive arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Most cases of reactive arthritis appear sporadically, but outbreaks may follow single-source infections. In such outbreaks, the proportion of infected subjects who developed subsequent reactive arthritis has ranged from 0 to 21 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/6,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14</a>].</p><p>The causative pathogens, incidence, and prevalence of reactive arthritis depend upon the geographic region. In general, among the pathogens, <em>Chlamydia</em> is probably the most endemic. It has been estimated that 4 to 8 percent of patients with chlamydial infection develop arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Some of epidemiological studies include cases in which the preceding enterobacterial and Chlamydial infections are silent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with reactive arthritis typically present with an asymmetric oligoarthritis, usually one to four weeks following the inciting infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/2,6,8,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,8,19</a>].The extent of the interval between infection and the onset of arthritis considered consistent with a reactive arthritis by expert consensus is a minimum of several days and a maximum of several weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In at least half of patients, all symptoms resolve in less than six months; in most patients, symptoms resolve within one year. The several types of clinical manifestations of reactive arthritis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of preceding enteric or genitourinary infection (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Preceding infection'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Musculoskeletal signs and symptoms (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Musculoskeletal signs and symptoms'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extraarticular signs and symptoms (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Extraarticular signs and symptoms'</a> below)</p><p/><p>Other than those symptoms due to the infection that has triggered the arthritis, the articular and extraarticular manifestations are similar regardless of the particular enteric or genitourinary organism or species of organism causing the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Preceding infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The characteristic symptoms of the enteric or genitourinary infections that can cause reactive arthritis are diarrhea or urethritis. Patients with arthritis induced by enteric bacteria can also develop aseptic urethritis. Many patients have been described in whom the preceding infections are clinically silent and detectable only by laboratory testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. There are no data to indicate whether the disease course or prognosis of reactive arthritis differs between patients with or without an antecedent infection that is symptomatic.

An association between reactive arthritis and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 has been noted in Caucasian HIV-infected patients but not in patients from sub-Saharan Africa, where the prevalence of HLA-B27 is much lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>Although a large variety of pathogens have been described that may induce musculoskeletal symptoms, an arthritis is conventionally considered to be a reactive arthritis only if some of the typical musculoskeletal features occur (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Musculoskeletal signs and symptoms'</a> below).

However, about 50 percent of patients have arthritis in the upper extremities, and some have polyarthritis in the small joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Less often, axial arthritis may occur, with areas involved including the spine at any level and also the sacroiliac joints.

Swelling at the heels is among the most characteristic symptom of enthesitis. Common sites of heel involvement are at the insertions of the Achilles tendon and of the plantar fascia on the calcaneus. Pain, swelling, and local tenderness are suggestive clinical features. Estimates of the frequency of enthesitis in patients with reactive arthritis have ranged from 20 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/11,25,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,25,27-29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In one study in the US of patients with documented enteric infections and a symptom of reactive arthritis, enthesitis was more common than arthritis or inflammatory back pain, occurring in 89 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/11,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Enthesitis is discussed in more detail elsewhere.

Enteroviral infection-associated arthritis may represent a substantial number of cases of nonspecific, self-limited inflammatory joint disease; although arthritis is an uncommon manifestation of enterovirus infection, viral gastroenteritis is relatively common. Additional symptoms suggestive of a viral etiology include the presence of myalgias, an evanescent rash, and constitutional symptoms such as fever. Both large and small joints may be involved. Sore throat, pleuritic pain, and myocarditis are other features suggestive of enteroviral infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

The presence of a rash and tenosynovitis are suggestive. However, purulent arthritis due to gonococcal infection can occur in the absence of these findings. Culture of synovial fluid, the urethra, and other potentially infected mucosal sites is helpful in the diagnosis or exclusion of DGI or gonococcal arthritis. Nucleic acid amplification testing may be substituted for culture of genitourinary sites when it is available.

These patients typically lack features common to the spondyloarthritides (eg, enthesitis), and this condition is generally not considered to be a form of reactive arthritis. Other clinical and laboratory manifestations of rheumatic fever and evidence of recent streptococcal infection distinguish these patients from those with reactive arthritis.

However, there were limitations to the study: the numbers in each group were too small to compare the different antibiotic regimens, and the study was limited to patients with evidence of persistent chlamydial infection by a special PCR using peripheral blood or synovial samples instead of routine urine samples. Serologic tests did not correlate with these PCR results, and the PCR assays that were used in the study are not yet available for routine clinical use and are not of proven clinical utility.

There is no evidence that NSAIDs shorten or otherwise affect the course of the disease.</p><p>NSAIDs are used initially because treatment of the infection does not alleviate the signs or symptoms of arthritis, because the disease is most frequently self-limited, and because most patients will not require disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to control inflammation or to prevent erosive joint changes. The use of NSAIDs is based upon their ability to provide significant symptomatic relief in other forms of SpA and upon clinical experience with their use in reactive arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/6,19,55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,19,55-57</a>]; there have been few formal trials of NSAIDs in reactive arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].

Complete blood counts, renal function, and hepatic aminotransferases should be measured after two months on a given agent and then every three to six months thereafter in patients continuing to require antiinflammatory dosing regimens of NSAIDs, depending upon the comorbidities present.

Various other bacterial and viral infections have been suggested as triggers for postinfectious arthritis but they are by convention not considered as &ldquo;reactive arthritis.&rdquo; (See <a href=\"#H27140925\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Preceding infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Musculoskeletal features of reactive arthritis typically develop one to four weeks following an acute infection with one of the triggering organisms. At least one of the following is seen in all patients with this condition: asymmetric oligoarthritis (often affecting the lower extremities), enthesitis, dactylitis, and inflammatory back pain. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Musculoskeletal signs and symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extraarticular manifestations occur in some patients, but none are specific for reactive arthritis. These include eye involvement, most often with conjunctivitis, but infrequently with anterior uveitis; genitourinary tract symptoms; oral mucosal ulcers; and cutaneous manifestations such as keratoderma blennorrhagica, circinate balanitis, and psoriasis-like nail changes. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Extraarticular signs and symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory findings may include evidence of the antecedent infection, elevated acute phase reactants, and findings of inflammatory joint fluid in patients with arthritis. Plain radiographs are generally nondiagnostic. (See <a href=\"#H19942326\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H86466394\" class=\"local\">'Imaging abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is based upon the presence of characteristic musculoskeletal and other clinical features in a patient with a preceding or ongoing enteric or genitourinary infection, in whom other causes of arthritis have been excluded. There is no single definitive test for reactive arthritis. Laboratory testing to confirm infection if feasible may be helpful but is not required to make the diagnosis; such testing may include stool cultures in patients with ongoing gastrointestinal symptoms and testing for <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> with a vaginal swab or urine sample for nucleic acid amplification testing in patients with genitourinary symptoms and those without localizing symptoms of infection. Serological testing for preceding infections is used primarily in epidemiologic studies but is generally not useful in clinical care. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 testing may be useful in selected patients. (See <a href=\"#H19942416\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H86465809\" class=\"local\">'Antecedent or concomitant infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis encompasses disorders that can cause acute mono- or oligoarthritis, particularly those associated with bowel diseases or genitourinary symptoms (eg, enterovirus infection, inflammatory bowel disease, and disseminated gonococcal infection), acute septic or crystal arthritis, undifferentiated spondyloarthritis (SpA), and other postinfectious arthritic disorders. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic therapy should be used for treatment of active <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> infection, if present. In general, antibiotics are not indicated for uncomplicated enteric infections or for treatment of the arthritis itself. (See <a href=\"#H372392485\" class=\"local\">'Genitourinary tract infection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H372392478\" class=\"local\">'Enteric infection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H372392471\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of the infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest treatment of arthritis in most patients initially with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in antiinflammatory doses (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> 500 mg two to three times daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> 50 mg three times daily, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> 50 mg three times daily), rather than starting a disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) upon diagnosis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H205784\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who do not respond adequately to NSAIDs, we suggest intraarticular glucocorticoids, rather than initiating therapy with daily oral glucocorticoids or a DMARD. (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H205791\" class=\"local\">'Intraarticular glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who do not respond adequately to NSAIDs and intraarticular glucocorticoid injections, we suggest low to moderate doses of systemic glucocorticoids, rather than initiating treatment with a DMARD. (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). A typical dose would be <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, 20 mg daily, titrated to the lowest dose required to control symptoms (See <a href=\"#H27140953\" class=\"local\">'Systemic glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who have not responded adequately to NSAIDs over at least four weeks and who require ongoing therapy with more than 7.5 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or equivalent for more than three to six months we suggest a trial of a nonbiologic DMARD, rather than continuing moderate to high dose glucocorticoids without a DMARD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We usually prescribe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ, beginning with 500 mg daily and titrating the dose to a maximum of 3 g daily). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a> (MTX, up to 25 mg one day weekly) is an alternative to SSZ. Treatment with a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker may be used in the rare patients who are resistant to NSAIDs and nonbiologic DMARD therapy. (See <a href=\"#H206213\" class=\"local\">'Nonbiologic DMARD use'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20433847\" class=\"local\">'Sulfasalazine'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20433855\" class=\"local\">'Methotrexate'</a> above and <a href=\"#H206245\" class=\"local\">'Resistant to nonbiologic DMARDs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis is good in the majority of patients, with spontaneous remission within 6 to 12 months of onset of arthritis. However, some patients have persistent but mild musculoskeletal symptoms, and others develop radiologic evidence of joint injury and evolve to a more chronic form of SpA. (See <a href=\"#H30217817\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-arthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ahvonen P, Sievers K, Aho K.
