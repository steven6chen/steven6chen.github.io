Types of migrants include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Refugee &ndash; Someone who, &quot;owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable to or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthcare-for-adult-immigrants-and-refugees/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Refugees seek to establish their status as a refugee having fled their country of origin and while residing in a country of first asylum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asylum seeker &ndash; An individual who has submitted a claim to a government for refugee status and is waiting for the claim to be accepted or rejected. Asylum seekers seek to establish their refugee status after fleeing to a country where they hope to be granted asylum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asylee &ndash; An individual whose claim for refugee status has been granted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parolee &ndash; An individual allowed into a country for urgent humanitarian reasons. Parole confers temporary status only; parolees must depart when the conditions supporting their parole cease to exist.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4179564\"><span class=\"h1\">PRELIMINARY SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Refugees to the United States undergo screening before arrival via an organized system that includes the Department of State, the International Organization for Migration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), state health departments, and United States resettlement agencies. Often these individuals have health insurance or entitlement to healthcare on arrival for a designated period of time. Many clinical practices for other migrant groups are extrapolated from the best practices developed for refugee settlement.</p><p>Legal migrants to the United States must undergo screening before arrival for specific infectious diseases of public health significance (such as tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases), illicit drug use, and psychiatric issues that may pose a threat to themselves or others. Some groups are excluded from specific requirements (for example, refugees and international adoptees are exempt from vaccine requirements), and many undocumented migrants, visitors, and students arrive with no health or immunization records. Most migrants warrant additional screening tests (eg, hepatitis B serology, hemoglobin) and may need treatment for parasites or malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthcare-for-adult-immigrants-and-refugees/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It should not be assumed that a screening test has been done, a vaccine has been administered, or presumptive therapy has been administered in the absence of written documentation (including month and year of administration or antibody testing).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4179392\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPROACH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27778925\"><span class=\"h2\">Health assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published guidelines for medical examination of newly arrived refugees, as well as a <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/pdf/checklist-refugee-health.pdf&amp;token=29cADjsrtJSsU6rzQJJ8ug38aDE9Q0EUCW9MmmtkV6CWG0PlpGsjt1NTYO863qKZlCZtYvRw/1yo/+kJeG/sEfgrqmtqcmyuNga777S6BTA=&amp;TOPIC_ID=13959\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">checklist</a> that includes screening recommended for refugees arriving in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthcare-for-adult-immigrants-and-refugees/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, the Canadian Collaboration for Immigrant and Refugee Health has published guidelines for care of immigrants and refugee populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthcare-for-adult-immigrants-and-refugees/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Clinicians should tailor guidelines for screening, diagnostic evaluation, and management to individual circumstances, including exposure history, symptoms and signs, and risk factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27777173\"><span class=\"h3\">Establishing rapport</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Establishment of rapport is critical for productive clinical encounters with recent immigrants. Stressful factors for immigrant patients include lack of familiarity with the healthcare system, language and cultural barriers, and the possibility of prior emotional or physical trauma. In addition, limited health literacy is often a significant issue of which to be aware. Patients may be reluctant to discuss concerns due to fear that revealing health problems may affect their immigration status.</p><p>Stressful factors for healthcare providers include lack of familiarity with health assessment done abroad and recommendations for screening in the United States, unfamiliarity with illnesses seen more commonly in migrants, language and cultural barriers, and pressure to perform a significant workload of testing, immunization, and health maintenance activities in a limited amount of time, often through an interpreter.</p><p>All screening tests and immunizations need not be completed in the first visit; establishing a trusting relationship will facilitate completion of all the required elements over time. Explaining what to expect and inquiring about immediate medical or social concerns will help facilitate establishment of rapport. Addressing immediate concerns at the first visit and repeating inquiries about general and family well-being at each subsequent visit reinforces empathy and compassion and can build trust between the patient and provider. Effective listening may elicit additional concerns not revealed initially.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27777179\"><span class=\"h3\">Health history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The health history should include standard elements such as current and prior medical problems, surgeries, pregnancies and their outcomes, medications (including complementary and alternative), allergies, and immunizations. Family history should also be elicited.</p><p>Mental health issues deserve special attention as many migrants have lost not only their homeland but also family members to disease, war, or unwanted separation. Many have experienced rape or torture; this information may not be offered in early interviews. Mental health screening should occur in the first or second visit and include assessment for suicide risk and other issues. (See <a href=\"#H27777251\" class=\"local\">'Mental health screening'</a> below.)</p><p>Social history should include inquiry regarding current living conditions as well as migration history, including regions of residence and travel. Migrants may spend many years en route, which may include time in remote, rural settings, urban areas, or in refugee camps. Other important components of the social history include education, languages (preferred spoken and written language for interacting with the health system), occupational history, and current support system.</p><p>Early appointments should also be used to address issues such as explaining the local medical care delivery system, the concept of a primary care provider, access to after-hours care, and emergency services. Issues related to routine preventive care should also be addressed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-care-in-adults-recommendations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive care in adults: Recommendations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27777185\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vital signs and growth parameters (height, weight, and head circumference in young children) should be measured and compared with age- and gender-based norms. Migrants may be underweight or overweight; nutritional deficiencies are more prevalent; and chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes may have gone undiagnosed. Assessment of vision and hearing is important, as deficiencies can affect school performance, job placement, and general quality of life. Dental caries are a common medical problem among new immigrants; oral hygiene and dental care should be identified and addressed early.</p><p>A complete physical examination should be performed, although, if there are no acute issues, genital exams are best deferred to a follow-up appointment. Special attention should be paid to findings that may reflect previously undiagnosed medical conditions, traditional cultural practices, or prior torture. For example, skin lesions may reflect parasitic infection, traditional healing methods (scarification), or retained shrapnel related to trauma. Hepatosplenomegaly may be present in patients with hyperreactive malaria syndrome or schistosomiasis. Heart murmurs may be present in patients with conditions ranging from anemia to tetralogy of Fallot, and signs of heart failure may be appreciated in patients with rheumatic heart disease or Chagas disease. Genital examination may reveal findings more common in refugees, including female genital cutting or hydrocele from filariasis. (See <a href=\"#H4594830\" class=\"local\">'Additional pearls'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4176748\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunizations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment for completion of primary immunizations and immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases should be undertaken. Immunization records may be considered valid if they include the name of the vaccine and the month and year of administration and if the schedule reflects the recommended timing as outlined in the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsUgXejRPQelpwO+8EkAakdn0e2a80KVW6YQfTiWPnq1L&amp;TOPIC_ID=13959\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">schedules</a> published by the CDC. As an example, a measles-containing vaccine (eg, measles-mumps-rubella [MMR]) would not be considered valid if administered before one year of age.</p><p>The optimal approach to serologic testing for immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases is uncertain but varies with likelihood of previous vaccination or infection. For example, serologic testing is usually appropriate for varicella and hepatitis A because of high population prevalence. Testing for immunity to hepatitis B is done often in conjunction with testing for hepatitis B infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthcare-for-adult-immigrants-and-refugees/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Serologic testing for measles, mumps, and rubella may be done at the discretion of the provider; alternatively, MMR vaccine may be administered. Most favor administration of other routine vaccines without preliminary serologic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthcare-for-adult-immigrants-and-refugees/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Issues related to immunizations for adults are summarized in the Figures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82634\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82634 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62130\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62130 \">figure 2</a>) and discussed separately.

The CDC has published <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/guidelines/domestic/tuberculosis-guidelines.html&amp;token=L9CzlcQgYL+yOr3wCVuYjBidpuEIZBrDcnehyCFuqZ7zP+Bs0NzR+z0z6kNm8D58WvjhJBDL5tj1C93oFz1BXf17TQdxK4+Wkr8Z6W4sO/Q=&amp;TOPIC_ID=13959\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">guidelines</a> for tuberculosis screening in newly arrived refugees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthcare-for-adult-immigrants-and-refugees/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]; diagnosis of TB is also discussed further separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (tuberculosis screening) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Testing for LTBI should be performed regardless of time since immigration, since TB disease may present years after exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthcare-for-adult-immigrants-and-refugees/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In one study, 59 percent of foreign-born individuals diagnosed with active TB had resided in the United States for more than five years, 15 percent had been in the United States for less than one year, and 18 percent between one and four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthcare-for-adult-immigrants-and-refugees/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Testing for LTBI consists of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). TST or IGRA testing should be done at the time of live vaccine administration or deferred until four to six weeks later. For diagnosis of LTBI in patients with a history of Bacille Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) vaccination, IGRA is preferred over TST. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (tuberculosis screening) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Interpretation of the TST depends on the patient's risk factors for tuberculosis. A TST of &ge;5 mm is considered positive for individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, other immunocompromising conditions, history of exposure to TB disease, and those with signs of tuberculosis on chest radiograph; a TST of &ge;10 mm is considered positive in all other categories of migrants.</p><p>Patients with a positive TST or IGRA should undergo chest radiography and assessment for signs of active tuberculosis. In the absence of active disease, treatment for LTBI should be administered.

Horizontal transmission of hepatitis B has been documented in family units. Hepatitis B&ndash;infected individuals should be evaluated for treatment, given vaccination against hepatitis A if not already immune, and, if not eligible or have failed treatment, should have routine screening for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma; this is discussed further separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease#H61645279\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma and recommendations for surveillance in adults with chronic liver disease&quot;, section on 'Surveillance methods'</a>.)</p><p>Tests used for hepatitis B screening include hepatitis B surface antigen (HBSAg), surface antibody (HBSAb or anti-HBS), and core antibody (HBcAB or anti-HBc).

Younger migrants may not have had hepatitis A as children due to improvements in sanitation in many countries. Screening may be cost effective for certain groups, such as older children and adults, those who have a history of hepatitis, or those who are candidates for routine immunization or who would otherwise require immunization (such as in the setting of travel or infection due to hepatitis B or C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthcare-for-adult-immigrants-and-refugees/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].

Screening is most appropriate for groups with identified risk factors or those coming from areas of known increased prevalence for hepatitis C (such as Pakistan, Egypt, and the Republic of Georgia). Migrants should be asked about history of blood transfusions or needle-sharing practices such as tattooing or acupuncture. Suggested prevalence rates to justify screening range from 0.8 to 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthcare-for-adult-immigrants-and-refugees/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].
