The GSDs are generally categorized by number according to the chronology of recognition of the responsible enzyme defect. As such, myophosphorylase deficiency is designated GSD V (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54417\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54417 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>In myophosphorylase deficiency, glycogen is not properly broken down in muscle cells, interfering with their function. Patients typically present in adolescence or early adulthood with exercise intolerance, fatigue, myalgia, cramps, poor endurance, muscle swelling, and fixed weakness, but symptoms commonly are present in the first decade of life. Patients have resting elevations in creatine kinase (CK) and episodes of rhabdomyolysis. Genetic testing is the most reasonable and efficient method to confirm a diagnosis in patients with consistent clinical symptoms. A functional and minimally invasive option to the diagnosis of suspected myophosphorylase deficiency involves nonischemic forearm muscle exercise testing. Management includes avoidance of low-carbohydrate diets and low-to-moderate aerobic exercise.</p><p>Myophosphorylase deficiency is reviewed in detail here. Other GSDs and related disorders are reviewed separately.

The prevalence in the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas area was estimated to be 1:100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phosphorylase has an important role in glucose homeostasis and catalyzes the degradation of glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate by removal of alpha-1,4-glucoside residues from the outer branches of the glycogen molecule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The degradation of glycogen continues until the peripheral branches of glycogen have been shortened to approximately 4 glucosyl units.</p><p>Phosphorylase exists in three distinct isozymes (muscle, liver, and brain), but diseases are only described for muscle and liver (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-phosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-vi-hers-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver phosphorylase deficiency (glycogen storage disease VI, Hers disease)&quot;</a>). The muscle-specific symptoms of this disorder result from the inability to generate energy from muscle glycogen due to deficiency of the muscle isoform of phosphorylase. Cellular mechanical stress from increased muscle glycogen stores, downregulation of sodium-potassium pumps, and elevation of sarcoplasmic calcium leading to decreased cellular integrity can all result in rhabdomyolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Oxidative stress and purine nucleotide metabolism may also contribute to muscle damage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myophosphorylase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in the muscle isoform of phosphorylase (muscle glycogen phosphorylase, <em>PYGM</em>), located at 11q13. Affected individuals have inherited a mutation in each copy of <em>PYGM</em>. This means each of an individual's parents will be an obligate carrier of one normal allele and one pathogenic allele. Thus, with each pregnancy, there is a 25 percent chance of the baby inheriting two alleles containing a pathogenic mutation and developing myophosphorylase deficiency, a 50 percent chance of inheriting one normal allele and one pathogenic allele (ie, an unaffected carrier), and a 25 percent chance of inheriting two normal copies of the gene and being unaffected and not a carrier.</p><p>Carriers of myophosphorylase deficiency do not become symptomatic. In a study of oxidative capacity and lactate production during maximal cycle exercise in 8 patients with myophosphorylase deficiency, 7 heterozygous carriers, and 11 healthy subjects, heterozygotes had maximal oxidative capacity and peak lactate responses identical to healthy subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Previous reports of manifesting carriers of myophosphorylase deficiency have suggested pseudodominance, although this is likely attributable to the high carrier frequency of <em>PGYM</em> mutations and the lack of comprehensive DNA sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Numerous pathogenic mutations in <em>PGYM</em> have been described, although no genotype-phenotype correlations have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/4,5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,8</a>]. The most common mutation worldwide (in studied populations), but especially in affected Caucasian individuals in Europe and the United States, converts an arginine (R) residue to a stop codon (X) in exon 5 (p.R50X) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other common mutant alleles include p.G205S in these populations and the p.W798R mutation in the Spanish population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The p.F710del is the most common in the Japanese population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/4,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,10</a>].</p><p>Two patients with compound heterozygosity (one of the common mutations on one allele and novel splicing mutations in introns 3 and 5 on the other allele) were both reported to have a milder phenotype with unusually high exercise capacity, probably related to the ameliorating effect of minimal myophosphorylase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, genotype-phenotype correlation has otherwise not been possible in myophosphorylase deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Nevertheless, the identification of these mutations has facilitated carrier detection and has proven diagnostically valuable.</p><p>The phenotype can be modulated by polymorphic variants of other genes. As an example, disease severity correlated with the genotype at the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) locus. An <span class=\"nowrap\">insertion/deletion</span> variant (the D allele) associated with modestly increased ACE activity was found more commonly in Spanish and Italian patients with more severe symptoms and reduced exercise tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myophosphorylase deficiency usually presents in adolescence or early adulthood with exercise intolerance, fatigue, myalgia, cramps, poor endurance, muscle swelling, and fixed weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Typical laboratory findings include myoglobinuria and elevated creatine kinase (CK). The presentation is somewhat different in older adults and very young children. Older patients may present with progressive weakness without history of cramps or myoglobinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Myophosphorylase deficiency has also been reported in young children. Four children presented at or shortly after birth with respiratory insufficiency, generalized weakness, and hypotonia that lead to death in infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Another child (14 months old) presented with transient elevation of CK that was observed only during febrile episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H616550390\"><span class=\"h2\">Muscular involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with myophosphorylase deficiency develop muscle stiffness, pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> weakness that can be induced by either brief periods of intense isometric exercise (eg, weight lifting) or by less intense but sustained dynamic exercise (eg, jogging). The degree of muscular involvement is variable in affected patients, but exercise intolerance worsens over time in most patients with myophosphorylase deficiency.</p><p>A &quot;second wind&quot; phenomenon, an improvement in myalgias, muscle stiffness, initial fatigue, and tachycardia after approximately 10 minutes of exercise, is experienced by patients with myophosphorylase deficiency. This &quot;second wind&quot; can be explained by increased blood flow, enhanced delivery of free fatty acids with concurrent activation of fatty acid metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and also increased hepatic glucose utilization. A study of the Spanish myophosphorylase deficiency registry reported 86 percent repeatedly experienced this phenomenon during their life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In one study of 112 patients with myophosphorylase deficiency, fixed weakness affecting proximal more than distal muscles (which was more often noted in older patients) was noted in 28 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In another study of 80 patients with myophosphorylase deficiency, permanent weakness was noted in 11 percent of subjects after the age of 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In the Spanish national registry of 239 cases, 99.5 percent reported exercise intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A case-control study found that young adult patients with myophosphorylase deficiency have lower lean mass, bone mineral content, and bone density than controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, these differences largely disappeared when comparing physically active patients with controls, suggesting that regular physical activity can prevent these changes.</p><p>The characteristics of muscle pain were examined in 24 patients with McArdle disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Pain was intermittent and exercise induced in 15 of the 23 patients who reported pain. However, in eight patients, permanent pain was a major clinical symptom, albeit not related to age or disease duration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H616550457\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute kidney injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intense or prolonged exercise can lead to rhabdomyolysis. In more severe cases, this can lead to release of myoglobin from muscle tissues. Myoglobin is excreted in the urine and can cause renal damage. In the Spanish national registry, acute kidney injury was reported in 4 percent, and one case of chronic renal failure was reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a study in the United Kingdom, myoglobinuria was seen in 62 percent and acute kidney injury in 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Misdiagnosis is common, with patients often labelled as &quot;unfit,&quot; having &quot;growing pains,&quot; or having other psychological conditions, rheumatic disorders, or other neuromuscular disorders. This leads to inappropriate treatment recommendations and an average diagnostic delays of 29 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A variety of tests may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Sequencing of muscle glycogen phosphorylase (<em>PYGM</em>) is now readily available and is the most efficient and least invasive means of confirming the diagnosis following detection of clinical symptoms and abnormal laboratory findings. Consultation with a clinical geneticist or a clinical biochemical geneticist may be helpful.</p><p>A minimally invasive approach to the diagnosis of suspected myophosphorylase deficiency, if the clinical history is not clear, involves initial forearm muscle exercise testing. This is then followed by genetic testing if the results are suggestive of myophosphorylase deficiency. A more invasive approach is to proceed to muscle biopsy with biochemical or histochemical analysis that includes testing for myophosphorylase. In the case of an abnormal muscle biopsy result, genetic testing will confirm the result.

Next-generation sequencing panels often include myophosphorylase deficiency within larger myopathy panels. However, given the variable frequency of <em>PYGM</em> mutations in different populations, the ethnic background of the patient should be taken into consideration to appropriately target testing for common mutations.

This test typically consists of having the patient perform maximal effort, one-second handgrips every other second for one minute (approximately 30 contractions). Blood samples for lactate, ammonia, and CK are taken before starting the test and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 20, and 30 minutes after the end of the exercise. A flat venous lactate curve with normal increases in ammonia is consistent with the diagnosis of myophosphorylase deficiency. The test should be discontinued if the patient complains of muscle pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cramps during the exercise, although this is uncommon if the test is performed properly. The forearm ischemic test, which involves the inflation of a blood pressure cuff to cut off circulation, is no longer recommended, because it triggers muscle pain and cramps and may cause acute compartment syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histochemical staining for myophosphorylase in muscle frozen sections reveals no activity in muscle fibers in most cases. In some patients, however, there may be up to 10 percent of normal residual enzyme activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Myophosphorylase activity may also be detected on histochemical testing in muscle biopsies with a significant number of regenerating fibers because of the existence of a fetal isozyme immunologically different from mature muscle phosphorylase in these fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Regenerating fibers usually are numerous in muscle biopsy specimens after an episode of myoglobinuria. Thus, a muscle biopsy performed shortly after an episode of rhabdomyolysis may provide a false-positive histochemical reaction for myophosphorylase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Enzymatic testing of myophosphorylase activity and glycogen content is clinically available from fresh-frozen muscle biopsy samples. Myophosphorylase activity is normal in erythrocytes, platelets, and cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with McArdle disease, a finding probably related to the existence of nonmuscle isozymes.</p><p>The muscle biopsy in myophosphorylase deficiency may also reveal focal subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar accumulations (&quot;blebs&quot;) of normally structured glycogen.

Forearm exercise testing may help in differentiating myoadenylate deaminase deficiency from myophosphorylase deficiency through an insufficient rise in ammonia with normal elevations of lactate. Biochemical testing for these other myopathies minimally should include plasma ammonia, plasma acylcarnitines, plasma total and free carnitine levels, blood glucose, blood and urine beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate (ketone) levels, and urine organic acids during periods of clinical symptoms. Diagnostic sequencing of the myophosphorylase gene muscle glycogen phosphorylase (<em>PYGM</em>) or the genes of the other forms of myopathies is clinically available, often as larger next-generation DNA sequencing panels that include all of these genes, and is often necessary to distinguish these disorders.

The frequency of specific mutations varies depending upon the ethnic background of the patient. In myophosphorylase deficiency, glycogen is not properly broken down in muscle cells, interfering with their function. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myophosphorylase deficiency usually presents in adolescence or early adulthood with exercise intolerance, fatigue, myalgia, cramps, myoglobinuria, poor endurance, muscle swelling, and fixed weakness.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myophosphorylase deficiency is suspected on the basis of the history of exercise-induced symptoms. Genetic testing is the most efficient and least invasive means of confirming the diagnosis in patients with clinical findings consistent with the diagnosis. A minimally invasive approach to the diagnosis, with a nonischemic forearm exercise test, is usually taken in patients who do not have a clear clinical history. Muscle biopsy with histochemical and biochemical testing for myophosphorylase should only be performed when DNA sequencing is inconclusive.
