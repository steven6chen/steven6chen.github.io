Acute mountain sickness (AMS) and high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) represent a continuum of one form of such illness.</p><p>The pathophysiology, clinical presentation, treatment, and prevention of AMS and HACE are reviewed here. Other forms of high altitude illness are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-pulmonary-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude pulmonary edema&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude illness: Physiology, risk factors, and general prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute mountain sickness (AMS) and high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) are generally considered to represent two points along a single spectrum of disease, with the same underlying pathophysiology. Although several aspects of this pathophysiology remain unclear, the concept that <span class=\"nowrap\">AMS/HACE</span> represents a continuum, and that AMS can progress to fatal HACE, fits with clinical experience and is helpful for management. A full discussion of the pathophysiology of AMS and HACE is beyond the scope of this review, but may be found in the attached references [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Cerebral edema is consistently found in neuroimaging and at autopsy in patients with severe AMS or HACE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>]. MRI studies reveal reversible vasogenic brain edema, with characteristic T2 signal increase in the splenium of the corpus callosum and subcortical white matter. These findings indicate increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability.</p><p>Some hypotheses to explain this increased cerebral vascular permeability emphasize the role of increased intravascular pressure. Increased cerebral blood flow and the loss of autoregulation of intracranial pressure may contribute to such an increase. Chemical factors (eg, vascular endothelial growth factor, nitric oxide, cytokines) may also play a role by altering endothelial permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Survivors of HACE demonstrate microhemorrhages on MRI, evidenced by deposits of hemosiderin in the corpus callosum, which are not found in those with AMS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53871\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53871 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Brain herniation from severely increased ICP is the cause of death in HACE. Fatal cases demonstrate not only gross cerebral edema, but small petechial hemorrhages and sometimes venous sinus or other thromboses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p>The relationship between cerebral edema and mild to moderate AMS is less clear. There is evidence of mild extravascular water (vasogenic edema) and increased brain tissue volume from vasodilation in all persons exposed to hypoxic environments, irrespective of AMS. However, subjects with mild AMS may not demonstrate greater brain swelling on MRI than those without symptoms. Therefore, mild edema alone is unlikely to be responsible for the clinical manifestations of mild to moderate AMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The &quot;tight fit&quot; hypothesis suggests that it is not the amount of swelling that matters as much as the person's ability to tolerate such swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In other words, individuals with a greater brain to cranial vault ratio (ie, less room for the swollen brain) become more symptomatic than individuals with a smaller ratio (ie, more room) but with the same degree of cerebral edema.</p><p>Some believe that activation of the trigeminal vascular system, in a manner similar to migraine, may play a role in AMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">AMS epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is by far the most common high altitude illness (HAI). As with all HAI, the risk of AMS depends upon individual susceptibility, the elevation reached, and the rate of ascent. Thus, while AMS is uncommon below 2000 m (6500 ft), it is quite common (approximately 25 percent incidence) at sleeping elevations between 2000 and 3000 m, where the majority of ski resorts in the United States are located (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63999\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63999 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50199 \">table 2</a>). Recreational skiers traveling to such resorts generally complete their transition to high altitude quickly (within two days) further increasing their risk of AMS.</p><p>AMS is nearly universal (85 percent incidence) among those flying directly to Shyangboche, Nepal (elevation 3800 m) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It occurs in 67 percent of climbers taking one to two days to reach the summit of Mount Rainier (4392 m) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], but strikes only 30 percent of climbers taking approximately one week to reach the summit of Denali (6194 m) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Conversely, the incidence of AMS is negligible among individuals who remain at altitude only an hour or two after driving to Pikes Peak (elevation 4300 m) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>AMS occurs in both genders and at all ages, although the incidence is decreased among those 50 to 60 years or older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Women may be at slightly higher risk than men, but children and adults are both susceptible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/17,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20-22</a>]. HAI in children is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-disease-unique-pediatric-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude disease: Unique pediatric considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Neither youth nor physical fitness confers protection against AMS. Obesity, heavy exertion upon arrival at altitude, and residence at low altitude prior to ascent all appear to increase risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/5,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,23</a>]. However, smoking, oral contraceptives, and menstruation do not appear to increase risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A more detailed discussion of the risk factors for HAI generally is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude illness: Physiology, risk factors, and general prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">HACE epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of HACE is reported to be 0.1 to 2 percent at elevations in excess of 3000 to 4000 m (9800 to 13,000 ft), although HACE has been reported at altitudes as low as 2100 m [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. HACE is often complicated by concomitant HAPE. In fact, pure cerebral edema without pulmonary edema appears to be uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>HACE appears to occur in all ages and both genders in a fashion similar to AMS. Younger males may be at greater risk for behavioral reasons, such as continuing to climb in the presence of AMS symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>As with AMS, there are no physiologic, anatomic, or genetic characteristics that reliably predict susceptibility to HACE. Individuals with a history of AMS or HAPE are at greater risk of recurrence and of developing HACE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESENTATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">AMS diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is diagnosed clinically based upon the appearance of typical symptoms in a person who lives at low altitude, but has recently ascended to high altitude (generally over 2000 m).</p><p>Symptoms in adults resemble those of an alcohol hangover: primarily headache, which is often associated with fatigue, lightheadedness, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, disturbed sleep with frequent awakening, and mild shortness of breath with exertion. Symptoms may be mild or severely debilitating.</p><p>Symptoms of AMS in infants and young children are nonspecific and can include fussiness, crying, decreased playfulness, poor feeding, disrupted sleep, and possibly vomiting. AMS alone does not cause an elevation in body temperature and an appropriate evaluation for fever based upon age and immunization status is warranted in febrile children at altitude. AMS is often a diagnosis of exclusion in this group. The clinician should pay close attention to the child's signs and response to oxygen, and when in doubt should err on the side of a longer observation period before attributing symptoms to a benign cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-disease-unique-pediatric-considerations#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude disease: Unique pediatric considerations&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>The onset of AMS is usually delayed for 6 to 12 hours following arrival at high altitude, but can occur as rapidly as 1 to 2 hours or as late as 24 hours. Symptoms are often most severe after the first night, generally resolve in one day if there is no further ascent, and do not recur at the same altitude.</p><p>AMS may reappear upon ascent to higher altitudes. On occasion, symptoms of AMS may persist for weeks despite no further ascent. In such cases, descent is required if there is no improvement with standard treatment. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'AMS treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>There are no reliable objective measures for the diagnosis of AMS. Physical examination, laboratory values, vital signs, and pulse oximetry typically fall within the normal range for a given altitude. Clinical studies often employ a scoring system (eg, Lake Louise) for diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74655\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74655 \">table 3</a>) although this scale is not routinely used in clinical practice. Diagnosis may be straightforward in a young, otherwise healthy individual who has recently ascended to high altitude. However, the diagnosis may be difficult in the elderly, young children, and those with confounding illness. Other instruments to diagnose AMS have been reported (eg, Acute Mountain Sickness-Cerebral score, Visual Analog Scale for the Overall Feeling of Mountain Sickness, or the Clinical Functional Score [CFS]). Using the Lake Louise Questionnaire Score as the standard, they appear to have similar diagnostic accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, most experts do <strong>not</strong> routinely use them to diagnose acute mountain sickness. For high altitude clinics and research purposes, the CFS&nbsp;is easy to administer relative to the other scores and may be a reasonable screening tool to identify potential&nbsp;patients with AMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Although&nbsp;the specificity of the&nbsp;CFS is low at 67 percent, it does permit&nbsp;the capture of patients whose AMS&nbsp;syndrome is not primarily headache.</p><p>Supplemental oxygen may be used to support the clinical diagnosis. Providing 2 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> of oxygen by nasal cannula for 15 to 20 minutes prior to other interventions should markedly improve headache and other symptoms in cases of AMS.</p><p>The onset of symptoms more than two days after arrival at a given altitude, absence of headache, dyspnea at rest, and failure to improve rapidly with supplemental oxygen should prompt the clinician to search for an alternative diagnosis. No radiographic or laboratory testing is warranted, unless the diagnosis is unclear. Differential diagnoses to consider include carbon monoxide poisoning, migraine, dehydration, exhaustion, hyponatremia, viral syndrome, alcohol hangover, bacterial infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and intracranial mass.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">HACE diagnosis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High altitude cerebral edema (HACE) generally occurs in individuals with acute mountain sickness (AMS) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) at elevations over 3000 to 3500 m [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The hallmarks of HACE are encephalopathic symptoms and signs, including ataxic gait [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], severe lassitude, and progressive decline of mental function and consciousness (irritability, confusion, impaired mentation, drowsiness, stupor, and finally coma).</p><p>Signs of abnormal coordination, such as impaired performance of finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing, may be present. Focal neurologic findings, such as hemiparesis, slurred speech, or a discrete visual deficit, may rarely develop but are not typical and should raise concern for an alternative diagnosis, such as ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, or hypoglycemia.</p><p>The onset of general neurological signs (ie, encephalopathy and ataxia) signifies the transition from AMS to HACE. This transition can occur unpredictably and may require as long as three days or as little as 12 hours. HACE develops faster in patients with HAPE, most likely as a result of severe hypoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Patients with HAPE manifest pulmonary findings, such as crackles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-pulmonary-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude pulmonary edema&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Early symptoms of HACE may be missed or mistaken for exhaustion. Lethargy and irritability may manifest initially as diminished climbing performance, lack of participation in group activities, and the desire to be left alone. Even ataxia, the earliest physical sign of HACE, may be missed if the patient is lying in a tent, insisting that he is well and simply wants to be left alone.</p><p>A working diagnosis of HACE can be made presumptively and treatment started in any patient with a history of recent ascent (especially above 3500 m) and signs of encephalopathy. After descent, the clinician can reconsider the differential diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/5,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16</a>].

Lumbar puncture may reveal an increased opening pressure, but evaluation of the cerebral spinal fluid reveals normal findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Pulse oximetry shows hypoxemia, but according to several observational studies, it is not a reliable means for detecting AMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. Arterial blood gas often reveals exaggerated hypoxemia.</p><p>A chest radiograph may reveal pulmonary edema. Computerized tomography (CT) of the brain may show cerebral edema and attenuation of signal more in the white matter than gray matter.</p><p>MRI is more revealing, showing characteristic intense T2 signal in the white matter, especially the splenium of the corpus callosum, with no grey matter lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53871\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53871 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. There is no correlation between the severity of edema and subsequent clinical outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Since MRI may remain abnormal for days to weeks, it can be useful to establish the diagnosis of HACE even after recovery. Hemosiderin deposits may be present on MRI years after HACE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">AMS treatment</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of acute mountain sickness (AMS) is based upon symptom severity and, in mild cases, patient preference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Mild illness can be treated conservatively, while moderate to severe symptoms may require medication (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a>), supplemental oxygen, and occasionally descent. In the field, portable hyperbaric therapy may be available when supplemental oxygen is in short supply or unavailable. It is important that group members and the afflicted individual remain alert for any symptoms or signs of worsening disease, particularly at elevations where AMS may rapidly progress to high altitude cerebral edema (above 4000 m). The same general treatment approach is used for both children and adults.</p><p>Individuals with symptoms of AMS must be discouraged from ascending to higher elevations until symptoms have subsided. This may be difficult in the face of implicit or explicit pressures from members of the patient's climbing or hiking group, who do not wish to disrupt their schedule, or the patient's own desire to keep climbing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Conservative treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with AMS should avoid further ascent, limit physical activity, and seek further care if any symptoms worsen. They should avoid alcohol and other respiratory depressants because of the danger of exacerbating hypoxemia during sleep. Symptomatic treatment, such as basic analgesics for headache and antiemetics, is often helpful. With conservative treatment, most patients successfully acclimatize over 24 to 48 hours and symptoms resolve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptomatic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic therapy for headache may include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=promethazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Promethazine</a> and particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a> may be useful for nausea and vomiting.

Descent to an altitude lower than that where symptoms started effectively reverses AMS. Although the person should descend as far as necessary for improvement, descending 500 to 1000 m (1600 to 3300 ft) is usually sufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Individuals with AMS symptoms must NOT ascend to higher altitudes for sleeping. Doing so is a common reason for developing severe high altitude illness (HAI).</p><p>AMS patients must be carefully monitored for any sign that illness is progressing and should descend immediately if symptoms worsen despite rest or treatment. Absolute indications for immediate descent include neurologic findings (ataxia or change in consciousness) and signs of pulmonary edema. Subtle changes such as irritability, lethargy, diminished performance, and dyspnea at rest should also alert team members that the patient may be progressing toward HACE or high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Oxygen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supplemental oxygen effectively relieves the symptoms of AMS and can serve as an alternative to descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Low-flow oxygen (1 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min)</span> can be given by nasal cannula using a home oxygen concentrator, or stored oxygen if available. In the field, oxygen supplies are limited, and oxygen therapy provided at 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> may both relieve symptoms and help conserve supplies. Supplemental oxygen can also be used intermittently or as perceived necessary by the patient, based upon the severity of symptoms.</p><p>Oxygen therapy is generally prescribed for 12 to 48 hours or during sleep only, if symptoms are not severe. Some patients will respond to short-term treatment of an hour or so and remain improved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperbaric therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Portable, lightweight (less than 5 kg), manually inflated hyperbaric chambers are common in remote mountain clinics and on expeditions, where supplemental oxygen supplies are limited. By increasing barometric pressure, hyperbaric bags are capable of simulating a descent of 2500 m or more, depending upon the altitude where they are used. They are effective without supplemental oxygen, or may be used with an oxygen cylinder in the chamber to augment effectiveness.</p><p>One hour of treatment in a pressurized chamber relieves symptoms, although they return within 12 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Nevertheless, hyperbaric bags can be an effective temporizing measure while awaiting descent or the benefits of medical therapy. With more severe illness, long-term (12 hours or more) treatment may be necessary to resolve AMS completely.</p><p>Although effective, hyperbaric chambers are generally unnecessary for the treatment of AMS in the hospital setting and at lower elevations where supplemental oxygen alone is usually sufficient to alleviate symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6416840\"><span class=\"h3\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A summary of medications used to treat high altitude illness is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76719\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76719 \">table 4</a>).

If further ascent is planned, acetazolamide can be continued until maximum elevation is attained. Acetazolamide can also be taken episodically to speed acclimatization at any point while gaining altitude or to treat mild AMS. Symptoms do not recur when the drug is discontinued.

(See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'AMS treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early recognition and treatment of HACE are critical. Descent is the definitive treatment and should begin immediately at the first suspicion of HACE. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dexamethasone</a> and supplemental oxygen play important roles in facilitating descent or temporizing illness until evacuation can be performed. The most important action is to evacuate the patient to lower altitude before their condition renders them unable to assist with descent. If immediate descent is not possible, portable hyperbaric therapy and oxygen may be lifesaving. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'HACE treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> immediately upon the first suspicion of HACE. The initial dose is 8 to 10 mg given orally, intramuscularly (IM), or intravenously (IV), followed by 4 mg every six hours until complete descent is achieved. Dexamethasone is NOT a substitute for immediate descent. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'HACE treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Dexamethasone'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38\"><span class=\"h2\">Prophylaxis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians should reserve prophylactic medications for high-to-moderate risk situations, particularly individuals with a history of altitude intolerance. Even in individuals with a previous history of HAI, gradual ascent should be emphasized over pharmacologic prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a> should be given to individuals with a history of HAI who ascend to altitudes above 2500 m. It is also reasonable to give acetazolamide to individuals without such a history who travel directly from low altitude (near sea level) to altitudes above 2800 m. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Acetazolamide'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General nonpharmacologic measures to prevent HAI illness are discussed separately.
