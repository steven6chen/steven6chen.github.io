The ovaries are organs that are part of a woman's reproductive system. A woman's eggs are in the ovaries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Ovarian cancer occurs most often in women ages 50 to 65, and sometimes runs in families.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455403477\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of ovarian cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of ovarian cancer can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your stomach getting bigger</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling bloated or having stomach pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling full or having trouble eating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Needing to urinate often</p><p/><p>When ovarian cancer begins to grow, some women might not notice their symptoms much. But as the cancer grows, the symptoms become worse.</p><p>These symptoms can also be caused by conditions that are not ovarian cancer. But if you have these symptoms, you should let your doctor or nurse know.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455403484\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for ovarian cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor suspects you have ovarian cancer, he or she might order 1 or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultrasound or other imaging tests</strong> &ndash; These tests create images of the inside of the body and can show abnormal growths.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood tests</strong> &ndash; There are several blood tests that can help diagnose ovarian cancer. One is the &quot;CA 125&quot; blood test. CA 125 is a protein in the blood that goes up when a woman has ovarian cancer. The test can help find ovarian cancer, but it does not clearly show whether or not the woman has it. Blood tests can also help doctors decide whether they need to do surgery to diagnose ovarian cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgery</strong> &ndash; The only way to know for sure if a woman has ovarian cancer is for a doctor to do surgery and remove the ovary. While the surgery is going on, usually another doctor will look at cells from the ovary under a microscope to check for cancer. If cancer is present, the doctor will usually continue surgery and treat the cancer by removing as much of it as possible. Most of the time, this involves doing a surgery called &quot;total hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57901\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57901 \">figure 2</a>). For this surgery, the doctor removes the ovaries, the tubes that connect the ovaries to the uterus (called the fallopian tubes), and the uterus. If the cancer has spread to other nearby organs, the doctor might remove those, too.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455403491\"><span class=\"h1\">What is cancer staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer staging is a way in which doctors find out how far a cancer has spread.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455403498\"><span class=\"h1\">How is ovarian cancer treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most women, having surgery to remove the cancer is the first part of treatment. Further treatment will depend a lot on the stage of the cancer and her other medical problems. Some women might not need any further treatment after surgery. Other women might need further treatment that includes chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. Usually, these medicines go into a vein. But sometimes they can go through a small tube into the lower part of the stomach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455403505\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant one day?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to have a baby one day, tell your doctor before having treatment. Treatment for ovarian cancer usually leaves a woman unable to get pregnant. But for some women it might be possible to plan treatment so that pregnancy is still possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455403512\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, you will be checked every so often to see if the cancer comes back. Follow up tests usually include blood tests, exams, and imaging tests. You should also watch for the symptoms listed above, because having those symptoms could mean the cancer has come back. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have any symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455403519\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if the cancer comes back or spreads?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the cancer comes back or spreads, you might have more surgery or chemotherapy. You might also have a medicine called targeted therapy, which can help prevent cancer growth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455403526\"><span class=\"h1\">Can ovarian cancer be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If ovarian, breast, uterine, or colon cancer runs in your family, talk to your doctor. There might be things you can do to keep from getting cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455403533\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to follow all your doctors' instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for ovarian cancer involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have.</p><p>Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455403540\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ovarian cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysterectomy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hysterectomy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-are-clinical-trials-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What are clinical trials?
