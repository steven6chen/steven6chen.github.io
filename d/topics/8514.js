There are several important issues to be considered when hyperthyroidism occurs during pregnancy. These include understanding indications for treatment, therapeutic options for pregnant women, and goals of antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy.</p><p>The treatment of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy is presented here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and causes of hyperthyroidism and other aspects of thyroid disease during pregnancy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and causes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of thyroid disease in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Endocrine Society and the American Thyroid Association (ATA) have published clinical guidelines for the management of thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy that are similar to the approach outlined here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Treatment recommendations are predominantly based upon observational studies and clinical experience.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3139745931\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A good fetal and maternal outcome depends upon controlling the mother's hyperthyroidism. There are changes in thyroid physiology during normal pregnancy that are reflected in altered thyroid function tests. Thyroid function tests, therefore, should be interpreted with an understanding of trimester-specific reference ranges for the individual tests. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy#H1156384\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of thyroid disease in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Trimester-specific reference ranges'</a>.)</p><p>The goal of treatment is to maintain persistent but mild hyperthyroidism in the mother in an attempt to prevent fetal hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Overtreatment of maternal hyperthyroidism with thionamide antithyroid drugs (ATDs) can cause fetal goiter and primary hypothyroidism. On the other hand, transient central hypothyroidism may be seen in infants whose mothers had poorly controlled hyperthyroidism during pregnancy, presumably due to suppression of the fetal pituitary-thyroid axis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>To attain the goal of mild hyperthyroidism, the mother's serum <strong>free</strong> thyroxine (T4) concentration should be maintained at or just above the trimester-specific normal range for pregnancy or (especially if the trimester-specific reference range is not available) the <strong>total</strong> T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) should be maintained at 1.5 times above the nonpregnant reference range. The serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration should be below the reference range for pregnancy (eg, goal TSH approximately 0.1 to 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L),</span> using the lowest possible dose of medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Attaining these goals requires assessment of thyroid function frequently (ie, at four-week intervals) with appropriate adjustment of medication. (See <a href=\"#H3636355599\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring and dose adjustments'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21852089\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with symptomatic, moderate-to-severe, overt hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease, toxic adenoma, toxic multinodular goiter, or gestational trophoblastic disease require treatment of hyperthyroidism. Such patients will almost always have TSH values below 0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> and elevations in trimester-specific free T4 concentrations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> total T4 and T3 concentrations that exceed 1.5 times the upper limit of normal for nonpregnant patients.</p><p>Although hyperthyroidism due to gestational trophoblastic disease resolves with treatment of the underlying gestational trophoblastic disease and subsequent normalization of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels, symptomatic women require treatment prior to surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonthyroid-surgery-in-the-patient-with-thyroid-disease#H592559\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonthyroid surgery in the patient with thyroid disease&quot;, section on 'Preoperative preparation for urgent surgery'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydatidiform-mole-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydatidiform mole: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Not all patients with biochemical, overt hyperthyroidism require treatment if the hyperthyroidism is mild, since the goal of treatment is to maintain mild maternal hyperthyroidism.</p><p>Treatment of hyperthyroidism is <strong>not</strong> required in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient, subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal serum total or free T4 and T3 concentrations for pregnancy in the presence of a subnormal TSH) in the first trimester of pregnancy, because it is considered a normal physiologic finding and therefore does not require therapy.

Biochemical, overt hyperthyroidism (subnormal TSH and free T4 above the trimester-specific reference range or total T4 and T3 &gt;1.5 times above the upper limit of normal for nonpregnant patients) may not require treatment if mild and asymptomatic (or minimally symptomatic), since the goal of treatment is to maintain mild maternal hyperthyroidism. (See <a href=\"#H3139745931\" class=\"local\">'Goals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>In women who are being monitored without therapy, we measure TSH, free T4 (if there is a trimester-specific reference range), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> total T4 or total T3 every four to six weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21852102\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic options</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The therapeutic options for hyperthyroid pregnant women are limited because of the potential adverse fetal effects of the available treatments. Most women are treated with thionamides. Thyroidectomy in the second trimester is an option for women who are unable to take thionamides.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thionamides</strong> &ndash; Thionamides are the primary treatment of hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease, toxic adenoma, toxic multinodular goiter, or gestational trophoblastic disease during pregnancy. They are actively transported into the thyroid gland, where they inhibit both the organification of iodine to tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin and the coupling of iodotyrosines. (See <a href=\"#H2264875150\" class=\"local\">'Choice of thionamide'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Beta blockers </strong>&ndash; Beta blockers, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> (but not <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a>), can be used to treat tachycardia and tremor. However, long-term treatment with beta blockers (longer than two to six weeks) should be avoided because of concerns regarding fetal growth retardation and hypoglycemia, especially with atenolol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thyroidectomy</strong> &ndash; Thyroidectomy during pregnancy is rarely necessary but is an option for women who cannot tolerate thionamides because of allergy or agranulocytosis. (See <a href=\"#H703132157\" class=\"local\">'Thionamide intolerance'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Plasmapheresis has also been used to rapidly control hyperthyroidism in women with trophoblastic disease and severe hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1827088014\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach outlined here is similar to that of the Endocrine Society and the American Thyroid Association (ATA) clinical guidelines for the management of thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The majority of the discussion is focused on the treatment of Graves' disease during pregnancy as toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter are relatively less common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3145606178\"><span class=\"h2\">Control of symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In pregnant women with symptomatic, moderate-to-severe hyperthyroidism, beta blockers may be given to ameliorate symptoms. We typically start with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> 25 to 50 mg daily. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propranolol</a>, 20 mg every six to eight hours, is an alternative option. The dose can be increased as needed to control symptoms. However, if possible, beta blockers should be weaned as soon as the hyperthyroidism is controlled by thionamides because occasional cases of neonatal growth restriction, hypoglycemia, respiratory depression, and bradycardia have been reported after maternal administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/6,7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,11</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective analysis, women with chronic hypertension who used <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> in early (15 weeks gestation) compared with late (30 weeks gestation) pregnancy had significantly smaller babies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There has been one report suggesting a higher rate of spontaneous abortion for hyperthyroid women treated with both a thionamide and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> compared with a thionamide alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In most patients, beta blockers can and should be tapered and discontinued within two to six weeks.

In one report of 77 newborns of euthyroid mothers treated with PTU or methimazole, there were no significant differences in TSH concentrations measured in cord blood at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, compared with control neonates who were not exposed in utero to thionamides, mean cord TSH levels were higher in neonates exposed to PTU but not methimazole.</p><p>Low thyroid function at birth is found in approximately one-half of neonates whose mothers received PTU or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> during pregnancy and who had serum T4 concentrations within the normal (nonpregnant) range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In spite of these observations, two studies reported that the intelligence quotient (IQ) scores of children who were exposed to thionamides in utero (but were euthyroid at birth) were normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3050861060\"><span class=\"h3\">Pretreatment evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to initiating thionamides, we obtain baseline blood tests, including a complete blood count (white count with differential) and a liver profile (bilirubin and transaminases).

Carbimazole is available in some European and Asian countries. Carbimazole is completely metabolized to methimazole, although the carbimazole dose required to yield an equivalent dose of methimazole is approximately 40 percent higher. The choice of thionamide depends upon which trimester the drug is being initiated. Methimazole is preferred to PTU except during the first trimester of pregnancy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diagnosed prior to pregnancy</strong> &ndash; Women diagnosed with Graves' disease prior to pregnancy who are taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> could [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Elect to have definitive therapy with surgery or radioiodine prior to pregnancy.

We reserve this option for women who have already been treated with methimazole for 12 to 18 months, have a normal TSH level on low-dose therapy, and are thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) negative. If hyperthyroidism recurs after discontinuation, the patient should be treated with PTU (if relapse occurs in the first trimester) or methimazole (if relapse occurs after the first trimester).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients taking PTU in the first trimester may continue it for the remainder of pregnancy or switch back to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> at the start of the second trimester.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diagnosed during the first trimester</strong> &ndash; Women diagnosed with symptomatic, moderate-to-severe hyperthyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy should take PTU. Patients may continue PTU for the remainder of pregnancy or switch back to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> at 16 weeks. Clinical practice varies, and the decision should be made after discussing the options with patients and considering their values and preferences. Switching to methimazole reduces the exposure to PTU, which has more serious hepatotoxicity than methimazole; however, since methimazole is more potent than PTU, switching may increase the risk of maternal or fetal hypothyroidism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diagnosed after the first trimester</strong> &ndash; Women diagnosed with symptomatic, moderate-to-severe hyperthyroidism after the first trimester should take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a>.</p><p/><p>All three antithyroid drugs (ATDs) have been associated with possible teratogenic effects, but teratogenic effects are more severe with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> and carbimazole compared with PTU. There are numerous case series of aplasia cutis, a scalp defect, in newborns exposed to methimazole in utero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vesiculopustular-and-bullous-lesions-in-the-newborn-and-infant#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vesiculopustular and bullous lesions in the newborn and infant&quot;, section on 'Aplasia cutis congenita'</a>). More serious congenital malformations, such as tracheoesophageal fistulas, patent vitellointestinal duct, choanal atresia, omphalocele, and omphalomesenteric duct anomaly, have also been observed with maternal use of methimazole and carbimazole but not PTU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/20-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-30</a>]. However, mild birth defects, including preauricular sinuses and cysts and urinary tract abnormalities, have been observed after PTU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology and toxicity of thionamides&quot;, section on 'Potential teratogenicity'</a>.)</p><p>Gestational weeks 6 to 10 is the period of highest risk for birth defects from exposure to thionamides. Therefore, PTU is preferred during the first trimester. However, reports of severe PTU-related liver failure have raised concerns about the routine use of PTU, including the use of PTU in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methimazole</a> has also been associated with liver disease, but it is typically due to cholestatic dysfunction in the United States, and methimazole is less likely to cause liver failure than PTU. Certainly, a woman with even mild elevations in transaminases while taking PTU during the first trimester should be transitioned to methimazole during the second trimester, but because of the concern that methimazole (which is more potent than PTU) might result in transient maternal or fetal hypothyroidism, endocrinologists treating patients who are stable on PTU might prefer to continue PTU throughout pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Many experienced clinicians, however, have encountered one or two women inadvertently treated with radioiodine during early pregnancy; the anecdotal impression is that radioiodine given before approximately 8 to 10 weeks of pregnancy does not cause fetal hypothyroidism or birth defects. In one systematic review, the risks to the fetus were dependent upon the timing of exposure during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Spontaneous miscarriage was more likely when exposure (100 mGy) occurred during the first two weeks (prior to implantation). Exposure during organogenesis (from two weeks gestation) may result in birth defects.

In women who are being monitored without therapy, we measure TSH, free T4 (if there is a trimester-specific reference range), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> total T4 or total T3 every four to six weeks. (See <a href=\"#H21852089\" class=\"local\">'Indications for treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assuming there are no contraindications to its use, we suggest using a beta blocker for pregnant women with moderate-to-severe hyperthyroidism and hyperadrenergic symptoms (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, they should be given only to women who have many symptoms because occasional cases of fetal growth restriction, hypoglycemia, respiratory depression, and bradycardia have been reported after maternal administration. Beta blockers should be weaned as soon as the hyperthyroidism is controlled by thionamides. We typically start with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> 25 to 50 mg daily or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> 20 mg three to four times daily. (See <a href=\"#H3145606178\" class=\"local\">'Control of symptoms'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Beta blockers in the treatment of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with moderate-to-severe hyperthyroidism complicating pregnancy, we suggest a thionamide as our first choice of treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2822148909\" class=\"local\">'Decrease thyroid hormone synthesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We suggest using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propylthiouracil</a> (PTU) rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> in the first trimester and using methimazole for women who present in the second or third trimester (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients taking PTU during the first trimester can either switch to methimazole after 16 weeks or continue PTU throughout pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H2264875150\" class=\"local\">'Choice of thionamide'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid function tests (TSH and free T4 or total T4 if a trimester-specific reference range is not available for free T4) should be obtained every four weeks throughout pregnancy. If thionamides are discontinued in early pregnancy, thyroid tests should be checked weekly throughout the first trimester, then monthly. (See <a href=\"#H3636355599\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring and dose adjustments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The thionamide dose should be adjusted based on the results of the thyroid function tests to maintain serum free T4 concentrations at or just above the upper limit of normal, using a trimester-specific reference range, or total T4 and T3 (if trimester-specific normal ranges are not available) at approximately 1.5-fold above the upper limit of normal for nonpregnant patients. Serum TSH concentrations should be maintained below the reference range for pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H3636355599\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring and dose adjustments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with symptomatic, moderate-to-severe, overt hyperthyroidism who cannot tolerate thionamides because of allergy or agranulocytosis, thyroidectomy during pregnancy may be necessary (see <a href=\"#H703132157\" class=\"local\">'Thionamide intolerance'</a> above). Such women should be treated with a short course (7 to 10 days) of beta blockers and iodine in preparation for thyroidectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of hyperthyroidism&quot;, section on 'Preoperative preparation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radioiodine therapy for pregnant women with hyperthyroidism is absolutely contraindicated. (See <a href=\"#H36642764\" class=\"local\">'Therapies not recommended'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All fetuses of women with Graves' disease should be monitored for signs of fetal thyrotoxicosis by determination of fetal heart rate and assessment of fetal growth. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Fetal or neonatal hyperthyroidism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If fetal thyrotoxicosis is suspected, we suggest prenatal thyroid ultrasound to rule out fetal goiter. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Fetal monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the potential risk of fetal loss with fetal blood sampling, we suggest <strong>not</strong> performing this procedure routinely in pregnant women with Graves' disease. Specific indications for fetal blood sampling are outlined above. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Fetal monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the concerns about potential PTU-associated hepatotoxicity, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> rather than PTU for nursing mothers (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H948356206\" class=\"local\">'Breastfeeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with Graves' disease who have been treated before or during pregnancy need careful monitoring during the postpartum period as they may experience an exacerbation.
