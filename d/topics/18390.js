Augmentation of beneficial counter-regulatory systems such as natriuretic peptides is an additional strategy to treat HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-angiotensin-receptor-neprilysin-inhibitor-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Inhibition of neprilysin raises levels of several endogenous vasoactive peptides, including natriuretic peptides, bradykinin, and adrenomedullin. The combination of neprilysin inhibitor plus angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) therapy is used as an alternative to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (or single agent ARB) therapy.</p><p>This topic will discuss the clinical evidence on and use of the combination of ARB and neprilysin inhibitor (known as angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor or ARNI) therapy in HFrEF. The role of ACE inhibitors in HFrEF and an overview of pharmacologic treatment of HFrEF are discussed separately.

Augmentation of beneficial counter-regulatory systems such as natriuretic peptides is an additional strategy to treat HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-angiotensin-receptor-neprilysin-inhibitor-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Inhibition of neprilysin (a neutral endopeptidase) raises levels of several endogenous vasoactive peptides, including natriuretic peptides, bradykinin, and adrenomedullin and may thus have beneficial hemodynamic effects in patients with HF. This approach differs from the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nesiritide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nesiritide</a> (B-type natriuretic peptide) in the setting of acute HF, which did not improve clinical outcomes in the ASCEND-HF trial, as discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and receptor blockers in heart failure: Mechanisms of action&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nesiritide-in-the-treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nesiritide in the treatment of acute decompensated heart failure&quot;, section on 'Clinical trials'</a>.) </p><p>Importantly, neprilysin, in addition to degrading counter-regulatory vasoactive peptides thought to be favorable in the setting of heart failure (ie, natriuretic peptides), also degrades the deleterious neurohormone angiotensin II. Ecadotril, a pure neprilysin inhibitor, was found not to be beneficial in HF patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-angiotensin-receptor-neprilysin-inhibitor-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Strategies were then undertaken to inhibit both neprilysin and the RAAS system. Ompatrilat was a compound that inhibited neprilysin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), and aminopeptidase P. The commercial development of this compound was halted due to an unacceptably high rate of angioedema [], attributed to an increase in bradykinin levels, which occurred since neprilysin, ACE, and aminopeptidase P each degrade bradykinin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-angiotensin-receptor-neprilysin-inhibitor-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This is an important outcome to remember for it emphasizes the need to avoid concomitant neprilysin inhibition and ACE inhibition when treating patients with HF.</p><p>The strategy that ultimately proved successful in improving outcomes in HF was to combine a neprilysin inhibitor with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). It has been hypothesized that thus the elevated angiotensin II levels resulting from neprilysin inhibition are blocked by the ARB, preventing them from exerting detrimental effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F112675\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112675 \">figure 1</a>).

Some experts have suggested use of sacubitril-valsartan as a component of initial therapy for HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), but we feel that at this time there is insufficient clinical experience to recommend its use as initial therapy. Further, all subjects in PARADIGM treated with sacubitril-valsartan demonstrated they could tolerate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> 10 mg twice daily during a run-in phase of the trial before randomization. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For selected patients with stable mild to moderate HFrEF (LVEF &le;40 percent) with all of the following criteria, we suggest use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sacubitril-and-valsartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sacubitril-valsartan</a> in place of the ACE inhibitor (or single agent ARB) component of therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
