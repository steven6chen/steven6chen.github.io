In contrast to the term &quot;exercise,&quot; the term &quot;sedentary behavior&quot; is characterized as very low energy expenditure, while in a sitting, reclining, or lying position, over prolonged periods of time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3314360667\"><span class=\"h1\">GUIDANCE FOR CLINICIANS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians have an important role in promoting lifestyle changes, of which increased physical activity should be a major goal.</p><p>A brief, supportive message on the benefits of increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior, even without extensive counseling, should be beneficial. Many organizations emphasize a greatly enhanced role of clinicians to promote and monitor physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H817774987\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients who are capable of exercising, whether normotensive or hypertensive, should be advised to perform moderate-intensity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vigorous-intensity dynamic aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise lowers blood pressure in normotensive individuals, most of whom will develop hypertension over their lifetime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, there is inverse association of higher exercise dose with a lower incidence of hypertension incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and a lower rate of mortality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F82815\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82815 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The benefits and risks of exercise&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A medical evaluation is usually unnecessary prior to either prescribing exercise or reinforcing the patient's current level of physical activity (if adequate). However, some patients should undergo an evaluation (for example, with electrocardiogram [ECG] exercise testing) to determine if initiating an exercise program is safe. (See <a href=\"#H1256321079\" class=\"local\">'Deciding whether exercise testing is needed'</a> below.)</p><p>There is no one exercise prescription for all adults. In general, reasonable weekly goals for dynamic aerobic exercise are at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity (approximately 30 minutes per day, five or more days per week) or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity (approximately 30 minutes per day, three or more days per week).

However, recommendations are in flux.</p><p>In general, sedentary patients with known or, based upon signs and symptoms, suspected cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or kidney disease should undergo exercise testing before embarking on an exercise plan (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F116688\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116688 \">algorithm 1</a>). Among those already engaged in moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity, new signs or symptoms of cardiovascular disease should prompt a cessation of exercise until further testing can be done.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1200737999\"><span class=\"h2\">Type of exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous studies, including clinical trials, have examined the effects of exercise on blood pressure and other health outcomes. The available evidence supports dynamic aerobic exercise as a means to lower blood pressure and prevent and control hypertension. The evidence supporting resistance exercise is less compelling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H96302963\"><span class=\"h3\">Dynamic aerobic exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most extensively studied form of exercise is dynamic aerobic exercise, which is the regular and purposeful movement of large muscle groups in moderate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vigorous activity that places stress on the cardiovascular system. Examples include brisk walking, jogging, dancing, bicycling, swimming, and using certain exercise equipment, such as elliptical machines.</p><p>The amount of aerobic exercise performed is measured as the intensity compared with rest (expressed in metabolic equivalents [METs]), duration (minutes per session), and frequency (number of sessions per week).</p><p>More intense exercises require more METs; walking at 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">miles/hour</span> uses 3.5 METs, jogging at a 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">min/mile</span> pace uses 6 METs, and jogging at a 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">min/mile</span> pace uses 10 METs. The total amount of dynamic aerobic activity can then be expressed as &quot;exercise volume,&quot; which is the product of average METs multiplied by the total number of minutes per week, with the goal of reaching 500 to 1000 MET <span class=\"nowrap\">min/week</span>. As an example, walking 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">miles/hour</span> for 30 minutes, five times per week (ie, 150 minutes per week) requires 525 MET <span class=\"nowrap\">min/week</span>.</p><p>Several meta-analyses and systematic reviews of trials that examined the effects of aerobic exercise on blood pressure have been conducted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/1,3,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,10,11</a>]. In one meta-analysis that aggregated data across 72 trials in hypertensive adults, aerobic exercise significantly lowered resting clinic <span class=\"nowrap\">systolic/diastolic</span> blood pressure by 3.<span class=\"nowrap\">0/2</span>.4 mmHg and daytime ambulatory blood pressure to a similar extent (3.<span class=\"nowrap\">3/3</span>.5 mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The blood pressure reductions were greater in trials of hypertensive patients as compared with trials of nonhypertensive individuals (6.<span class=\"nowrap\">9/4</span>.9 compared with 1.<span class=\"nowrap\">9/1</span>.6 mmHg). Overall, there was no observed effect of exercise dose, training frequency, training intensity, training session time, or specific type of exercise on the magnitude of the blood pressure reduction. However, meta-analyses are poorly suited to address such questions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3074917065\"><span class=\"h3\">Dynamic resistance exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence on the effects of dynamic resistance exercise is limited and inconsistent, even though some meta-analyses have concluded that dynamic resistance exercise modestly lowers blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This type of exercise is characterized by effort that is performed against an opposing force accompanied by purposeful movement of joints and large muscle groups. Common types of dynamic resistance exercise include weight lifting and circuit training, often with the use of exercise equipment. These types of exercise are typically performed with a goal of progressively increasing muscle strength. An ancillary benefit might be blood pressure reduction.</p><p>One meta-analysis included 25 trials that examined the effect of resistance training on blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Mean reductions in <span class=\"nowrap\">systolic/diastolic</span> blood pressure were 2.<span class=\"nowrap\">7/2</span>.9 mmHg. However, many of the included studies had design limitations, and the quality of evidence was poor. Importantly, there was no evidence of harm from dynamic resistance exercise (such as an acute triggering of cardiovascular events during exercise or a chronic worsening of blood pressure). Hence, resistance training for most individuals with hypertension is not contraindicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4283891275\"><span class=\"h3\">Isometric resistance exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even less evidence is available to support the blood pressure effects of isometric resistance exercise. Isometric resistance is characterized by sustained contraction of muscles with no change in the length of the involved muscle groups and no change in joint angle. Isometric resistance exercise may involve equipment, such as handgrips; other forms do not use equipment and involve maintaining a constant position such as sitting against a wall without a chair or maintaining a push-up position.</p><p>Most trials of isometric resistance were short in duration and enrolled few participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although meta-analyses of these studies have been published, some concluding a beneficial effect on blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], the data are too limited to draw such conclusions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H366190130\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose of exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no one exercise prescription that is appropriate for all adults. The prescription should be individualized to the patient's capabilities and to prevent injuries and maximize incentives for maintaining a consistent regimen.</p><p>Changing patients' behavior is often challenging, and supplying information and general recommendations alone is often insufficient. Hence, clinicians should provide the exercise prescription coupled with practical solutions, such as exercising with family and friends, joining community groups, and tracking minutes or counts of physical activity.</p><p>Reasonable exercise prescriptions include, but are not limited to, the following (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise#H32\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The benefits and risks of exercise&quot;, section on 'Exercise prescription'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least 150 minutes of <strong>moderate-intensity</strong> physical activity per week; this corresponds to approximately 30 minutes per day, five or more days per week.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least 75 minutes of <strong>vigorous-intensity</strong> physical activity per week; this corresponds to approximately 30 minutes per day, three or more days per week.</p><p/><p>In some patients, it is also reasonable to advocate for a modest increase in physical activity even if the specific goals above are not met.</p><p>Moderate and vigorous activity are technically defined by percentile of peak VO<sub>2</sub> (ie, the peak rate of oxygen consumption) or by maximum heart rate. However, describing exercise to patients in these terms is not practical. Rather, clinicians should mention that, in general, individuals can talk during moderately intense activity. However, during vigorous-intensity activity, individuals can say no more than a few words without pausing for a breath.</p><p>Many patients and providers want to know how much exercise is necessary to achieve health benefits, as well as the corollary issue of whether vigorously intense exercise is more beneficial than moderately intense exercise. Unfortunately, data from trials on dose-response relationships are insufficient to answer these questions, at least for blood pressure. However, there are data from observational studies that suggest a progressive relationship of exercise dose with a lower hypertension incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and with mortality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F82815\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82815 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2373728713\"><span class=\"h2\">Major professional society recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The table provides an overview of exercise recommendation to prevent and control blood pressure by professional societies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F115400\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115400 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/1,3,14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,14-19</a>].

Findings from animal studies suggest aerobic exercise may prevent increases in blood pressure through beneficial changes in insulin sensitivity and autonomic nervous system function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] while resistance training may prevent increases in blood pressure through reduced vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Other potential mechanisms include reduced inflammation, oxidative damage, sodium sensitivity, and arterial stiffness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3249667088\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3974700303\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of antihypertensive medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ability to perform exercise may be adversely effected by antihypertensive medications. Beta blockers, particularly those that are nonselective, can significantly diminish exercise performance. There is, however, a training effect, and maintenance of performance levels has been observed in patients treated with beta blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

For weight loss, it is extremely difficult, although not impossible, to achieve a sufficiently large calorie deficit from increased exercise alone. In one trial, for example, individuals assigned to either 400 or 600 kcal of aerobic <span class=\"nowrap\">exercise/session,</span> five <span class=\"nowrap\">sessions/week</span> for 10 months, lost 3.9 and 5.2 kg, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In individuals who have lost weight, a high level of physical activity (eg, one <span class=\"nowrap\">hour/day</span> or more of moderate aerobic activity) is often needed to sustain the weight loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
