Pediatric clinicians should have some knowledge regarding CAM because they may be asked to advise patients regarding these therapies or provide referrals to CAM practitioners. Clinicians should ask about the CAM therapies their patients are using and know where to turn for additional information when questions arise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78642\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78642 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-medicine-in-pediatrics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the use of CAM therapies in pediatrics. The use of CAM therapies for specific disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, is discussed in the relevant treatment topics. As an example, see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-complementary-and-alternative-therapies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">Autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents: Complementary and alternative therapies</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Integrative medicine is relationship-based care that focuses on the whole person; is informed by evidence; and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, health care professionals, and disciplines to promote optimal health and healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-medicine-in-pediatrics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Complementary therapies are a subset of integrative medicine; they are used as adjuncts to conventional care. The list of practices that are considered to be complementary or alternative changes as practices and therapies become part of mainstream medicine over time and in different cultures. Integrative medicine encompasses some common basic values. These values reflect the importance of individual rights and the increasing education levels and access to information that characterize modern society:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recognition of the primary importance of treating the patient as an individual rather than a constellation of symptoms (patient-centered care)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recognition that the family has the primary role in providing care and that the role of the clinician is one of counselor, teacher, and advice giver rather than issuer of orders</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recognition that family-clinician relationships are partnerships as opposed to hierarchies</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recognition of the importance of a sustainable healing environment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recognition of the inherent healing ability of the individual</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recognition of the importance of prevention and health promotion</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternative</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alternative medicine refers to therapies that are used in place of conventional care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Complementary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complementary therapies are used in conjunction with mainstream medical therapies. These therapies do not replace medical regimens for serious medical problems but are offered to support the patient and family. Examples include massage, support groups, guided imagery, biofeedback, and hypnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-medicine-in-pediatrics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Folk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Folk medicine refers to therapies that are provided by family or group members as part of a family or cultural tradition. Examples include using &quot;cold&quot; foods for &quot;hot&quot; illnesses, religious or ritual healing practices (eg, coining or sand painting), and using chicken soup to treat upper respiratory infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-medicine-in-pediatrics/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Integrative</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Integrative medicine refers to the integration of CAM therapies into mainstream medical practice based upon evidence of safety and effectiveness within the context of relationship-based care promoting optimal health and well-being (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82394\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82394 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-medicine-in-pediatrics/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

In an increasing number of specialty settings (eg, neonatal intensive care units, gastroenterology clinics), conventional clinicians advise patients to use therapies formerly considered alternative, such as omega-3 fatty acid and probiotic supplements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-medicine-in-pediatrics/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Holistic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Holistic medicine refers to the care of the whole patient (eg, body, mind, emotions, spirit, and relationships) in the context of his or her values, beliefs, culture, and community. Holistic medicine is closely related to comprehensive care and contextual pediatrics. Examples of holistic medicine include promotion of literacy, screening for depression or alcohol use in family members, assessment of spirituality, and promotion of housecleaning to reduce allergic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-medicine-in-pediatrics/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The annual number of outpatient visits to CAM professionals is greater than the number of outpatient visits to mainstream clinicians in the United States.

It is important for the pediatric clinician to routinely obtain a complete history, including use of CAM therapies, products, and services (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57149\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57149 \">table 3</a>), because CAM and mainstream medical therapies may have adverse interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-medicine-in-pediatrics/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>Pediatric clinicians may be concerned that families who use CAM are unsatisfied with mainstream medical care and will abandon effective therapies for unproven alternatives, which has been associated with adverse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-medicine-in-pediatrics/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, families who use CAM therapies rarely abandon their mainstream pediatric clinicians, and adverse effects associated with CAM and <span class=\"nowrap\">CAM/conventional</span> interactions appear to be less frequent than known adverse effects from conventional therapies.

Initial visits typically last 45 minutes. Patients with acute conditions are scheduled for follow-up two to three times per week. Follow-up visits generally are 15 to 20 minutes long. Nearly one-half of chiropractor fees are covered by third-party payers, including Medicare and most major medical insurance carriers.</p><p>Children and adolescents account for 10 to 20 percent of chiropractor visits, and most chiropractic schools offer courses in pediatric care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-medicine-in-pediatrics/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. When treating children, chiropractors tend to take fewer radiographs, to use lighter force when making adjustments, and to use a device called an activator to make adjustments. They treat children in the parents' laps or use special pediatric tables.</p><p>Many chiropractors, particularly members of the International Chiropractic Association, promote regular chiropractic care for children as an essential part of pediatric health promotion.

No well-designed prospective double-blind randomized studies have shown that chiropractic care is as effective or more effective than mainstream care for these conditions, nor have studies demonstrated the effectiveness of chiropractic care in preventing mild or serious pediatric disorders. On the other hand, significant adverse effects from chiropractic adjustments are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-medicine-in-pediatrics/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], and the rate of malpractice claims against chiropractors is much lower than the rate of suits against medical doctors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-medicine-in-pediatrics/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Acupuncture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acupuncture, a component of traditional Chinese medicine, is based upon the theory of a vital energy or chi (qi) that circulates through the body in channels called meridians. Disease occurs when the flow of vital energy is disrupted or blocked. Health returns when the flow is restored, balanced, and harmonized. Acupuncture restores the flow of vital energy through stimulation of specific points along the energy meridians.</p><p>Most American acupuncturists are trained in America.

Approximately 80 percent of licensed acupuncturists also recommend dietary changes, herbs and other supplements, and changes in lifestyle, exercise, rest, and relationships to enhance health. Acupuncture visits increasingly are covered by insurance. The Affordable Care Act section 2706 mandates nondiscrimination in payment to licensed health care professionals. Thus, pediatricians are likely to see increased availability of affordable acupuncture services for their patients.</p><p>Approximately 18,000 practicing acupuncturists are licensed in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-medicine-in-pediatrics/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], including &gt;1300 physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-medicine-in-pediatrics/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Acupuncturists typically see 30 to 60 patients per week. Initial visit length is approximately 90 minutes, and follow-up visits last approximately one hour. Acute conditions typically are treated two to three times per week for two to three weeks, after which the visit frequency gradually is reduced until treatment is no longer needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-medicine-in-pediatrics/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Benefits of therapy, when they occur, usually are evident within the first five treatments.</p><p>Most acupuncturists rarely treat children; less than 10 percent of acupuncturists see three or more children per week. Most acupuncturists who treat children use special techniques, including nonneedle methods (eg, heat, magnets, lasers, and vigorous massage or tapping) to stimulate points along the energy meridians. In addition, they may use the Japanese style of acupuncture, which is gentler than the Chinese style.</p><p>Acupuncture commonly is recommended by clinicians; over one-third of North American pediatric pain treatment programs provide acupuncture services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-medicine-in-pediatrics/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Many of the major teaching hospitals with a pediatric pain service offer acupuncture to treat chronic pain in children.

It is based upon two principles:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The law of similars</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The law of dilutions</p><p/><p>According to the law of similars, a remedy that would cause a symptom in a healthy person is used to treat the same symptom in a sick person (&quot;like cures like&quot;). As an example, poison ivy might be used to treat a child suffering from eczema. Serious side effects from homeopathic treatments rarely occur. The safety of homeopathy is attributed to its second principle. According to the law of dilutions, the more the remedy is diluted, the more powerful it becomes. Homeopaths believe that dilute remedies contain energy or information that is used by the patient to heal his or her symptoms. In contrast, most mainstream clinicians believe that dilute homeopathic remedies contain no active molecules and that the remedies have a placebo effect that triggers the patient's psycho-neuro-immunologic healing systems.

Increasingly, special diets, such as the low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet and exclusive enteral nutrition are recommended by conventional gastroenterologists to treat IBS and inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-management-in-primary-care#H495530705\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Management in primary care&quot;, section on 'Dietary triggers'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents#H1252944020\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of Crohn disease in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Exclusive enteral nutrition'</a>.)</p><p>Parents may choose vegetarian, macrobiotic, or other special diets for religious, ethical, or health reasons. They may choose to purchase only organically grown meat and produce. They may wish to have their children avoid possible allergens (eg, wheat, dairy products, tree nuts, shellfish, corn, soy, and peanuts). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vegetarian-diets-for-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vegetarian diets for children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=organic-foods-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Organic foods and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Severely restrictive diets, particularly for infants, may result in failure to thrive, malnutrition, and, occasionally, death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-medicine-in-pediatrics/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Parents may not be aware of the potential nutritional deficiencies of restrictive diets for their children or of the means to address these deficiencies within their dietary framework. They should be referred to a qualified pediatric dietitian for specific advice before restricting gluten, dairy, or other commonly consumed foods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to making dietary recommendations, pediatric clinicians also encourage physical activity as part of routine health supervision. Pediatric clinicians should be aware that certain exercise therapies may be useful in the management of specific conditions. As an example, yoga may be particularly useful for children suffering from asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-medicine-in-pediatrics/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Environmental</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Environmental manipulation has long been used in the mainstream medical care of children. Examples include phototherapy for jaundice, vibration for colic, cold for pruritus, music for anxiety, and mattress and pillow covers for children with allergy to dust mites. Environmentally based complementary and alternative therapies include crystals, lights, sounds, magnets, ionizers, aromatherapy, and radionic devices. These therapies are marketed as being safe and effective for children. Although data to evaluate these claims are lacking, most of the therapies appear to be benign.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Integrative medicine is relationship-based care that focuses on the whole person; is informed by evidence; and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, health care professionals, and disciplines to promote optimal health and healing. Complementary therapies are a subset of integrative medicine. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) typically is used as an adjunct rather than an alternative to mainstream medical care. Families may turn to CAM therapists who offer them personal attention, hope, time, and therapies consistent with their values, world view, and culture. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Relationship between CAM and mainstream medicine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CAM therapies include acupuncture, massage and other types of bodywork, chiropractic, prayer, homeopathy, bioenergetic therapies (Therapeutic Touch, Healing Touch, Reiki), guided imagery and biofeedback, herbs and supplements, and lifestyle therapies (diet, exercise, and environmental manipulation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82394\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82394 \">table 2</a>).
