They are part of a network of vessels called the called the &quot;lymphatic system,&quot; which carries a clear fluid called &quot;lymph&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86801\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86801 \">figure 1</a>). When breast cancer cells spread, they usually travel first through the lymph to 1 or more lymph nodes in the armpits. These lymph nodes are called &quot;sentinel lymph nodes.&quot;</p><p>During a sentinel lymph node biopsy a surgeon finds, takes out, and checks the sentinel lymph node (or nodes) for cancer cells. Knowing whether cancer is in the sentinel lymph nodes helps your doctor choose the right treatment for your breast cancer.</p><p>A sentinel lymph node biopsy is also called an &quot;SLNB.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H702671591\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during an SLNB?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The operation is usually done under general anesthesia. This means you will get medicines through a small tube into a vein (called an &quot;IV&quot;) or gases that you breathe through a mask to make you unconscious.</p><p>Doctors use 2 different techniques to find the sentinel node (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86545\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86545 \">figure 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blue dye &ndash; For this technique, the doctor injects blue dye into your breast near the cancer after you are unconscious in the operating room. The dye travels through the lymph and turns the sentinel node blue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A radioactive substance &ndash; For this technique, the doctor injects a radioactive substance into your breast near the cancer and the colored area around your nipple, before you go to the operating room. Then, after you are unconscious, the doctor uses a special device that finds radioactive substances to locate the sentinel lymph node.</p><p/><p>Most surgeons use just 1 of these techniques, but some use both. After finding the sentinel node, the surgeon makes a small cut to take it out, then sends it to a lab. A different doctor then checks the node for cancer cells. Often, more than 1 sentinel node is found and taken out.</p><p>Most people do not have cancer in their sentinel lymph nodes. But if they do, the surgeon might take out other nearby nodes to check them as well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H702671608\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after an SLNB?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After an SLNB, you might have pain, bruising, bleeding, or get an infection. Your doctor will prescribe pain relievers or other medicines to treat any symptoms.</p><p>If your doctor used blue dye, part of your breast will be blue until all of the dye disappears from your body. Your urine will also turn green for 1 day.</p><p>In rare cases, people are allergic to the dye used for SLNB. Your doctor will tell you about this risk and answer any questions you have before the operation. The allergic reaction happens in the operating room and is treated right away with medicines given through an IV.</p><p>If your doctor used a radioactive substance, the amount of radioactivity is very low and not harmful. It leaves your body quickly through your urine. You are not &quot;radioactive&quot; or dangerous to other people near you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H702671625\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breast cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breast cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-breast-problems-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Common breast problems (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Breast cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-guide-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Breast cancer guide to diagnosis and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
