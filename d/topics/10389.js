This involves mobilization of the proper resources, both personnel and equipment, prior to initiation of the procedure. Although a lot has been written about techniques for managing difficult vaginal deliveries, there is a paucity of literature to assist obstetricians with a difficult cesarean delivery. The only available information is from case reports, small case series, and expert opinion.</p><p>This topic will focus upon methods for managing two difficult clinical scenarios when fetal extraction may be difficult at cesarean delivery: the deeply engaged fetal head and the floating fetal presenting part.

While there are limited data on what an adequate incision size at cesarean is, most experts suggest that this should be approximately 15 cm (the size of an Allis clamp) for the cesarean delivery of a term fetus (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Surgical technique&quot;</a>). A Pfannenstiel incision may be enlarged significantly by transverse incision of the rectus muscles (Maylard incision). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incisions-for-open-abdominal-surgery#H3294939\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incisions for open abdominal surgery&quot;, section on 'Incisions for pelvic operations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although simple lateral extension of a low transverse uterine incision may be adequate, a low vertical incision in the midline (T-shaped hysterotomy) or at the lateral aspect of the uterine incision (J-shaped hysterotomy) may be required to avoid injury to the uterine vasculature and possibly the urinary tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Upper uterine segment extensions may increase the risk of uterine rupture in a future pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitroglycerin</a> &ndash; Uterine relaxation can be achieved quickly with nitroglycerin. Onset of action is immediate, and relaxation lasts for three to five minutes. We suggest 50 micrograms nitroglycerin administered intravenously, followed by up to four additional doses of 50 micrograms every 60 seconds, as needed to achieve adequate uterine relaxation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Beginning with the minimal effective dose may decrease the risk of maternal hypotension, compared with an initial bolus of 100 to 200 micrograms, but the higher initial dose may be more appropriate when urgent fetal extraction is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Most patients achieve adequate uterine relaxation with a total dose of &le;250 micrograms. However, the only randomized trial comparing nitroglycerin versus placebo to facilitate fetal extraction during elective repeat cesarean delivery did not demonstrate any benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DEEPLY ENGAGED FETAL HEAD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The deeply engaged fetal head is impacted if it cannot be gently moved out of the pelvis during a vaginal examination between contractions or if there is insufficient space between the fetal head and symphysis pubis to permit delivery with standard cesarean maneuvers. Impaction is most likely to occur following a prolonged second stage of labor or after failed attempts at operative vaginal delivery. It is noted in approximately 1.5 percent of cesarean deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Use of standard delivery maneuvers in this setting may cause extensive trauma to the lower uterine segment, uterine vessels, cervix, vagina, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urinary tract and may injure the fetus (intracranial hemorrhage, skull fracture, neck fracture, asphyxia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Postpartum hemorrhage, broad ligament hematoma, injury to the ureters during repair, and postpartum infection are additional concerns. However, it can be difficult to distinguish the adverse effects attributable to disengagement maneuvers from the adverse effects of a prolonged second stage or a failed trial of instrument delivery.</p><p>The following procedures have been used for delivering the fetus with a deeply engaged fetal head. Clinicians should be mindful to two common pitfalls. The most common error made by inexperienced operators is to make the hysterotomy too low; sometimes the vagina is incised and may be quite challenging to repair. The second most common error is acting too hastily and forcefully. Even in the setting of acute fetal bradycardia, taking an extra few seconds to assess anatomy and initiate gentle maneuvers will likely not contribute to any additional fetal compromise. A well-placed incision and slow, careful, and deliberate placement of the operator's hand around the vertex will allow controlled extraction of the vertex and lower the likelihood of uterine extension. In particular, the operator should avoid flexing <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> wrist against the myometrium between the incision and cervix. Using this area as a fulcrum to dislodge the head can result in cervical lacerations. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110670646\"><span class=\"h2\">Reverse breech extraction (&quot;pull method&quot;)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reverse breech extraction was described by Fong and Arulkumaran in Singapore in 1997 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], but has received little attention in the United States. If a reverse breech extraction is planned, the obstetrician should consider a low vertical incision to avoid the need to perform a T-incision or J-incision of the uterus.</p><p>The operator's hand is inserted into the uterus towards the fundus to grasp the fetal feet, which are then pulled to perform a footling breech extraction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74863\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74863 \">figure 1</a>). When grasping and pulling the feet, care must be taken to only apply traction parallel to the axis of the legs to avoid fracturing the fetal tibia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibula. Once the feet are through the hysterotomy incision, the delivery is accomplished as a typical breech delivery, with care taken to avoid hyperextension of the fetal neck.</p><p>The reverse breech extraction technique appears to have a lower risk of lateral or downward uterine incision extension, less blood loss, and shorter operative time, compared with abdominopelvic delivery (&quot;push method&quot;) (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Abdominovaginal delivery (&quot;push method&quot;)'</a> below). In a 2014 meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials and retrospective cohort studies of reverse breech extraction (pull technique) versus abdominovaginal delivery (push technique) of the deeply impacted fetal head, abdominovaginal delivery was associated with an eightfold increase in the rate of uterine incision extension (odds ratio [OR] 7.8, 95% CI 5.0-12.2), as well as increased blood loss and need for blood transfusion (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.4-5.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Mean operative time was also longer. Data were insufficient to make clear conclusions about any difference between fetal extraction techniques in risk of birth trauma or wound infection. A 2016 Cochrane review of techniques for assisting difficult delivery at cesarean reached similar conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Another 2016 meta-analysis on this topic noted that abdominovaginal delivery was associated with a much higher rate of uterine extension than the shoulders first (Patwardhan) technique; no studies compared the reverse breech extraction and shoulders first techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Further study on the safety of these approaches is indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominovaginal delivery (&quot;push method&quot;)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominovaginal delivery refers to a procedure in which an assistant places <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> gloved, cupped hand into the vagina to gently disengage and push the impacted fetal head up into the uterus for cesarean delivery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F113849\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113849 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Three or four fingers are separated and spread over a large area of fetal skull to avoid exerting excessive focal pressure, which can be traumatic. The operating obstetrician also assists from above by providing steady upward traction on the fetal shoulders and by attempting to flex the fetal head or at least prevent further deflexion. To facilitate vaginal access, the mother's legs are abducted into the &quot;Whitmore&quot; or &quot;frog&quot; position on the operating room table.</p><p>Although the use of an assistant's hand transvaginally is the preferred method to accomplish this maneuver, the primary obstetrician can also perform this task, but should change gloves before resuming transabdominal procedures. In the absence of an assistant, the primary obstetrician uses <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> transabdominal hand to prevent further deflexion and places <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> other hand in the vagina to push up the head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>This technique is generally successful in dislodging the impacted fetal head and creating a space between the bony pelvis and fetal skull so abdominal delivery can be completed in the usual manner. However, it also increases the risk of uncontrolled extension of the uterine incision, potentially resulting in laceration of local anatomic structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/1,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15</a>]. Additionally, it has been associated with serious fetal morbidity, including neonatal skull fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], so care must be taken to avoid excessive pressure on the fetal skull when pushing up from below or when the operator places <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> fingers between the fetal skull and the maternal pelvic bones.</p><p>If abdominovaginal delivery is anticipated, both the abdomen and perineum should be prepped preoperatively. Despite thorough surgical preparation and antibiotic prophylaxis, the risk of postpartum endometritis appears to be increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], presumably because of contamination of the operative field by vaginal flora.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal head elevator, obstetrical spoon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal head elevators and obstetrical spoons function as fetal shoe horns. Because they take up less space than the obstetrician's hand, they are easier to get around a tightly impacted head. Minimal data have been published on the efficacy and risks associated with use of these instruments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3449574593\"><span class=\"h3\">Obstetrical spoons</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several variations of these instruments are available, including the Coyne spoon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63801\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63801 \">figure 3</a>), the Sellheim spoon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79379\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79379 \">figure 4</a>), and the Murless head extractor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54227\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54227 \">figure 5</a>). For each instrument, the smooth, rounded edge is carefully slipped into the uterus, between the fetal head and the anterior lower uterine segment, and gently positioned below the fetal head. Using the handle, the instrument and fetal head are then carefully elevated out of the pelvis, and the delivery is completed in the usual manner. With this technique, care must be taken to lift the handle vertically or cephalad (relative to the mother), rather than forcing it caudad (like a shoe horn), to avoid injury to the maternal bladder and to minimize extension of the incision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3358533222\"><span class=\"h3\">Fetal head elevators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The C-Snorkel is a disposable device consisting of a molded, polymer tube and a flat, curved polymer tip with multiple ventilation ports. The tip is inserted into the vagina so that it lies between the vaginal wall and the fetal head and releases the vacuum on the fetal head. Thus, it facilitates extraction of the impacted head and eliminates the need for an assistant to elevate the head from below the surgical drapes.

The literature regarding its use is limited, though one report of 23 patients demonstrated a reduction in hysterotomy extensions when the C-Snorkel was used as compared with historical control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The Fetal Disimpacting System (<a href=\"http://www.safeob.com/animation.html&amp;token=tBGDHAPpfc3BtumWjcLsYcIcLYcyQ4CmJqLhqaf2XL83fnCIw5Vmdu0jCKU5fGti&amp;TOPIC_ID=4450\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">fetal pillow</a>) is another variation on the fetal elevator. The device has a balloon that is inserted into the vagina just below the fetal scalp when the patient is being prepared for cesarean delivery. A short time before the hysterotomy incision is made, the balloon is inflated with 60 to 120 mL saline, which is supposed to gently lift the fetal head 2 to 3 cm from its original position. After the newborn is delivered, the device is deflated and removed. In a randomized trial of 240 women undergoing cesarean delivery at full dilatation, use of this device resulted in a significant reduction in hysterotomy extensions (32.5 percent without the device versus 5 percent with the device) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Having an assistant gently push the shoulder cephalad while the primary obstetrician tries to extract the fetal head in the standard manner may facilitate delivery.</p><p>If this is ineffective, the Patwardhan's shoulders first technique has been used successfully for difficult fetal extraction at cesarean in India [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The technique involves first delivering the anterior shoulder and arm and then rotating the fetus and delivering the posterior shoulder and arm. The fetal trunk, breech, and lower limbs are then successively delivered through the incision using a combination of gentle traction on the arms, fingers beneath the thorax, and fundal pressure. Once the body is delivered, the head is lifted out of the pelvis in the same manner as a reverse breech extraction. Compared with the traditional abdominopelvic delivery technique, Patwardhan's technique has been reported to reduce the risk of uterine <span class=\"nowrap\">lacerations/extension</span> of the incision, bladder injuries, and need for blood transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Vacuum extraction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some authors have described using the vacuum extractor to assist in delivering an impacted fetal head during cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. However, no one has described the technique clearly, specifically where the vacuum cup is applied. Furthermore, severe fetal injuries, such as intracranial hemorrhage, have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Given the difficulty of safely placing the vacuum cup on an impacted fetal head and the potential for both maternal and fetal trauma from this approach, we suggest not using this technique.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">UNENGAGED, FLOATING FETAL HEAD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with the impacted fetal head, management of the unengaged, floating fetal head (-3 station or above) is a difficult problem. In contrast to the deeply engaged, impacted fetal head, where maternal anatomy can impede access to the head, the floating head is easily accessed but difficult to control.</p><p>In an uncomplicated cesarean delivery, the head has typically advanced beyond the site of the hysterotomy and has to be gently elevated into the incision. When the head is flexed toward the incision, uterine forces naturally push it along the path of least resistance, which is through the hysterotomy. The obstetrician's hand also acts as a guide. By comparison, when the head is floating above the hysterotomy incision, the uterus has already accommodated to the position of the fetus; therefore, uterine forces do not push it through the incision.</p><p>The floating fetal head is difficult for the obstetrician to grasp or establish traction; it cannot readily be pulled and guided through the incision. Applying fundal pressure is often inadequate and has a tendency to push the head laterally rather than towards the hysterotomy.</p><p>There are two relatively safe and easy options to alleviate the problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2784528250\"><span class=\"h2\">Internal podalic version</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Internal podalic version and delivery of the fetus as a breech is another option. This procedure is similar to reverse breech extraction of the impacted head, except the fetal head is verted. The obstetrician reaches into the uterus with one hand, grasps one or both of the fetal feet, and pulls them through the hysterotomy while guiding the head to the fundus with <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> other external hand. This technique causes the fetus to rotate from a vertex presentation to a footling breech presentation. The operator should apply traction only parallel to the axis of the legs when grasping and pulling the feet, and should avoid hyperextension of the fetal neck. (See <a href=\"#H110670646\" class=\"local\">'Reverse breech extraction (&quot;pull method&quot;)'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Extraction with vacuum, obstetrical spoon, or forceps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extraction with a vacuum, Coyne spoon, or forceps is another option when operators are uncomfortable with the technique of internal podalic version. After entry into the uterus and rupture of the membranes, an obstetrical vacuum extractor is placed over the flexion point (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69870\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69870 \">figure 6</a>) to deliver the fetal head, as with any standard vaginal vacuum-assisted delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/26,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29</a>]. Unlike the impacted head, the flexion point of the floating head is accessible. Use of a soft, bell vacuum cup minimizes the risk of injury to the fetus. Not much traction is needed since there should be minimal anatomic resistance to extraction.</p><p>An equally simple method, sometimes used by the author, involves slipping a Coyne spoon into the uterus, beneath the infant&rsquo;s cheek, and using the leverage of the spoon to draw the infant&rsquo;s head into the hysterotomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67734\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef67734 \">movie 1</a>).</p><p>Forceps can also be used in this situation, depending on operator comfort and experience. One group described their use of Barton&rsquo;s forceps, which have a hinged anterior blade and sliding lock, for grasping a high vertex in transverse position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, Barton&rsquo;s forceps are rarely used in contemporary obstetric practice and should not be used to deliver a floating head by operators who are not experienced with their use.</p><p>No studies have compared internal podalic version versus use of vacuum, spoon, or forceps for delivery of the unengaged, floating fetal head. A small randomized trial of 44 patients with unengaged fetal heads at cesarean reported no differences in safety outcomes between using fundal pressure versus vacuum versus forceps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-deeply-engaged-and-floating-fetal-presentations-at-cesarean-delivery/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For delivery of the deeply engaged, impacted fetal head, we suggest reverse breech extraction (&quot;pull method&quot;), as this approach is best supported by available literature.
