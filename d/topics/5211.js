However, tissue invasion is uncommon and occurs most frequently in the setting of immunosuppression associated with receipt of therapy for hematologic malignancies or hematopoietic cell or solid organ transplantation.</p><p>The diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of invasive aspergillosis are discussed separately; the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in HIV-infected patients as well as the diagnosis of other syndromes caused by <em>Aspergillus</em> spp are also presented elsewhere.

However, biopsy is frequently not feasible due to the risks of complications (eg, bleeding risk in patients with thrombocytopenia). A rational first step to establishing the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis involves the use of noninvasive modalities, such as serum biomarkers (galactomannan and beta-D-glucan assays), and obtaining sputum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens for fungal staining and culture. When BAL is performed, a sample should be sent for galactomannan antigen testing.</p><p>A positive sputum fungal stain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> culture should prompt therapy of hosts who are at risk for invasive aspergillosis. The galactomannan assay is relatively specific for invasive aspergillosis, and, in the right clinical context, provides adequate evidence of invasive pulmonary disease. In contrast, a positive beta-D-glucan assay can occur in the setting of various invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis.</p><p>Patients with clinical and radiographic findings that are suggestive of an invasive fungal infection but in whom both the serum galactomannan assay and fungal stain and culture of the sputum are negative (or are not able to be obtained) should ideally undergo bronchoscopy with BAL. Lung biopsy should be performed if feasible. Studies have demonstrated that bronchoscopy is safe and frequently yields important diagnostic information, especially when performed early in the evaluation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment of patients with pulmonary infiltrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Options for biopsy include bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy, computed tomography-guided transthoracic needle biopsy, and video-assisted thorascopic surgery. The most appropriate technique depends upon the location of the lesion(s), the individual patient's risk of complications from each procedure, and the necessity to establish the diagnosis. The decision regarding the need for a histopathologic diagnosis must be made on a patient-by-patient basis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1064486416\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC MODALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Aspergillus</em> species are frequently inhaled into the airways but, because of effective conidial clearance in the majority of individuals, disease usually does not result. Because we inhale conidia constantly, culture isolation of <em>Aspergillus</em> species from the airway does not necessarily indicate disease. Thus, the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis is based upon both isolating the organism (or markers of the organism) and the probability that it is the cause of disease. The latter is a function of the host's risk factors for disease (eg, immune status) and the clinical presentation. Demonstration of hyphal elements invading tissues (from biopsy of any affected site, such as the lung or skin) represents a proven diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Given the above issues, the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis is often referred to within a scale of certainty: possible, probable, or proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. These definitions have been developed in order to maintain consistency in clinical and epidemiologic studies, not to drive therapeutic decision making.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58499699\"><span class=\"h2\">Direct examination of respiratory specimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory specimens are usually stained with calcofluor white with 10% potassium hydroxide to detect the presence of fungal elements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Gomori methenamine silver can be used to stain cytology preparations. Organisms can be observed as narrow (3 to 6 microns wide), septated hyaline hyphae with dichotomous acute angle (45&deg;) branching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, several filamentous fungi, including <em>Scedosporium</em> spp and <em>Fusarium</em> spp, have similar appearances to <em>Aspergillus</em> spp on direct microscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1064486423\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Culture of the organism, in combination with evidence of tissue invasion on histopathology or culture from a normally sterile site, provides the most certain evidence of invasive aspergillosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, both microscopic examination and culture are insensitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and therapy should not be withheld in the absence of such confirmation. Furthermore, performing a biopsy is not feasible in some patients due to bleeding risk or risk of other complications. In patients with risk factors and clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiographic features that are suggestive of invasive aspergillosis, culture of <em>Aspergillus</em> spp from respiratory secretions provides adequate evidence of invasive disease.</p><p><em>Aspergillus</em> is a rapidly growing fungus in the laboratory and is often visible in culture within one to three days of incubation. However, identification of the species requires sporulation in order to microscopically examine spore-bearing structures.</p><p>Occasionally, organisms can be difficult to identify due to slow sporulation. Slow sporulating organisms may have been disregarded as non-pathogens in the past. However, more recently, slow-sporulating species (eg, <em>Aspergillus lentulus</em>, <em>Neosartorya udagawae</em>) with variable susceptibility profiles have been identified and implicated in invasive infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These organisms should not be disregarded as contaminants based on the slow-sporulating phenotype. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-invasive-aspergillosis#H19379070\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of invasive aspergillosis&quot;, section on 'Antifungal resistance'</a>.)</p><p>Many patients with documented invasive aspergillosis have negative cultures. This has been observed in surveillance studies, and the prevalence of negative cultures varies depending upon the population being evaluated. As an example, in multicenter surveillance studies, only 25 to 50 percent of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients who met criteria for invasive aspergillosis based upon galactomannan antigen results had positive cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>The predictive value of positive sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures is dependent upon both the host and the clinical presentation. In a study that evaluated the predictive value of lower respiratory tract cultures in different patient populations with probable or proven invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, the positive predictive value was highest in HCT recipients, patients with hematological malignancies, and granulocytopenic patients (72 percent), compared with solid organ transplant recipients and patients receiving glucocorticoids (58 percent) and HIV-infected patients (14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The positive predictive value was highest in BAL cultures, in part because the prevalence of invasive aspergillosis is higher among patients who have radiographic abnormalities warranting bronchoscopy. Clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of invasive aspergillosis were present significantly more often among infected patients compared with uninfected patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14377219\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the setting of invasive disease, organisms can be observed in biopsy specimens as narrow (3 to 6 microns wide), septated hyaline hyphae with dichotomous acute angle (45&deg;) branching (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68747\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68747 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57220\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57220 \">picture 2</a>). The organism can be seen using Gomori methenamine silver or periodic acid-Schiff staining. However, several hyaline molds, including <em>Scedosporium</em> spp and <em>Fusarium</em> spp, have similar appearances to <em>Aspergillus</em> spp in histopathologic sections. Since the treatment of infections caused by these fungi may differ, it is important to confirm genus and species by culture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fusarium-infection#H773301077\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Fusarium infection&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-scedosporium-and-lomentospora-infections#H863185641\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Scedosporium and Lomentospora infections&quot;, section on 'Histopathology'</a>.)</p><p>Histopathologic examination can sometimes distinguish the above organisms from the Mucorales order (the agents of mucormycosis), which appear as broad, nonseptate hyphae that exhibit right-angle branching (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66476\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66476 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72487\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72487 \">picture 4</a>). Occasionally, this distinction can be difficult, especially when small hyphal fragments are present or when the organism folds back on itself to create &quot;pseudo-septations.&quot; Determining whether the fungus is one of the Mucorales or another fungus is important because the Mucorales are not susceptible to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>, which is the treatment of choice for invasive aspergillosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mucormycosis-zygomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mucormycosis (zygomycosis)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-invasive-aspergillosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of invasive aspergillosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1064486430\"><span class=\"h2\">Galactomannan antigen detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Galactomannan is a polysaccharide that is a major constituent of <em>Aspergillus</em> cell walls. A double sandwich enzyme immunoassay (EIA) that utilizes the monoclonal antibody EB-A2 forms the current commercial (Platelia) assay, which has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for testing serum and BAL fluid. This antibody detects multiple epitopes on galactofuranose side chains that are linked to the large polymer mannan backbone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Galactofuranose is the six-member ring form of galactose, which is made by non-mammalian eukaryotes and some prokaryotic pathogens, and is a common antigenic moiety of different glycoconjugates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Although once described as being <em>Aspergillus </em>specific, we now know that galactofuranose is present in other fungi and certain other substances. (See <a href=\"#H1064486444\" class=\"local\">'Caveats'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22230119\"><span class=\"h3\">Interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The galactomannan EIA is performed with an optical read-out that is interpreted as a ratio relative to the optical density (OD) of a threshold control provided by the manufacturer; this ratio is called the OD index. Initial use of the test, largely in Europe, utilized a relatively high OD index (1 to 1.5) as a cut-off for positivity in order to ensure few false-positive results. Subsequent studies demonstrated that lower thresholds (0.5 to 0.7) provide relatively better performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The assay cleared by the FDA has a suggested threshold OD index of 0.5; thus, an OD index &ge;0.5 is considered to be a positive result.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1064486437\"><span class=\"h3\">Serum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some patients, galactomannan antigen can be detected in the serum before the presence of clinical signs or symptoms of invasive aspergillosis. Several studies have assessed its test characteristics, and the performance of the test has been addressed in a review and meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Some inconsistency in the reported performance of the test has been introduced by studies that used different cut-offs for positivity as well as other variables, such as different populations evaluated and testing on patients receiving concurrent antifungal drugs. One review noted that the sensitivity of the test varied from 30 to 100 percent, whereas specificity remained relatively high and constant (&gt;75 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis that included 50 studies with a total of 5660 immunocompromised patients, including 586 with proven or probable invasive aspergillosis, reported that using an OD index cutoff of 0.5, sensitivity of the galactomannan EIA was 82 percent (95% CI 73-90 percent) and specificity was 81 percent (95% CI 72-90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In another meta-analysis, subgroup analyses suggested that the assay performs better in patients who have a hematologic malignancy or who have received HCT; in comparison, the test performance may be limited in solid organ transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Whether this is related to biologic differences in the type of invasive disease, such as degree of fungal burden, is unclear. Few cases were included in the studies that have been performed; more patients who have different underlying diseases will need to be studied to establish the usefulness of this assay in disparate populations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1064486444\"><span class=\"h4\">Caveats</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following caveats should be considered when using the galactomannan EIA:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sensitivity of detecting galactomannan in serum is decreased by concurrent administration of mold-active antifungal therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the past, false-positive serum results were demonstrated in patients who were receiving intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a> due to the presence of galactomannan (or a cross-reactive antigen) in the antibiotic formulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. False-positive results persisted for as long as five days after discontinuation of piperacillin-tazobactam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Results of more recent studies suggest that current preparations of piperacillin-tazobactam rarely react with the assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. False-positive galactomannan results have also been reported with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a>, a formulation that is not available in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many fungi demonstrate galactomannans (or polysaccharides containing galactofuranose residues) on their cell walls. False-positive results of the <em>Aspergillus</em> galactomannan EIA may be seen with infections caused by organisms that share cross-reacting antigens. These include filamentous Ascomycetes that cause similar disease presentations (eg, <em>Fusarium</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]) and others (<em>Penicillium </em>species<em> </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>False-positive results are more likely to occur during the first 100 days following HCT and in patients with gastrointestinal tract mucositis caused by chemotherapy or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The proposed mechanism is that galactomannan in foods or bacteria having cross-reactive epitopes may translocate across the intestinal mucosa during periods of impaired mucosal integrity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another possible cause of false-positive galactomannan EIA results is contamination of foods with <em>Aspergillus</em> or closely related fungi, such as <em>Penicillium</em> spp. One report noted false-positive results associated with ingestion of large numbers of frozen ice-pops in the setting of gastrointestinal GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

These values are largely a function of the low prevalence of disease, even when measured in high-risk populations (usually &lt;20 percent). One should thus consider the clinical context to determine the probability of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Screening as a means to guide preemptive therapy or to withhold empiric treatment of fever has yet to be validated in randomized trials. More prospective studies are necessary to address the issue of when an antifungal can be withheld in this setting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> when the antigen result alone should guide therapy.

In the setting of clinical disease suspicion, prevalence is higher, assuring better predictive performance. The assay may also be useful in other immunocompromised patients at risk for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, but caution is necessary in interpreting results as sensitivity is not as high in patients who have disease that may be limited to the airways (eg, lung transplant recipients). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fungal-infections-following-lung-transplantation#H1838389\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fungal infections following lung transplantation&quot;, section on 'Galactomannan, beta-D-glucan, and PCR'</a>.)</p><p>Some investigators have suggested a role for serial galactomannan testing in patients with documented invasive aspergillosis, both as a prognostic measure of effectiveness of antifungal therapy and to differentiate between worsening fungal infection and worsening radiographic findings developing as a result of the host immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-42</a>]. The prognostic value of the serum galactomannan EIA is discussed separately.

The galactomannan EIA performed on BAL fluid provides additional sensitivity compared with culture, estimated in most studies to exceed 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>].</p><p>The optimal threshold OD index for positivity continues to be debated; a higher threshold OD index results in lower sensitivity but higher specificity for invasive aspergillosis. A retrospective study was performed in which 251 patients who were at risk for invasive aspergillosis and who presented with unexplained nodular lesions or consolidation on lung imaging underwent galactomannan EIA testing of BAL fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The patients had a variety of underlying diseases, including solid organ transplantation in 29 percent, hematologic malignancy in 20 percent, and non-hematologic malignancy in 13 percent. Using a threshold OD index of &ge;0.8, the sensitivity of galactomannan antigen testing of BAL fluid for diagnosing proven or probable invasive aspergillosis was 86 percent and the specificity was 91 percent, whereas an OD index threshold &ge;0.5 resulted in a sensitivity of 93 percent and a specificity of 87 percent. As noted above, the FDA considers an OD index of &ge;0.5 to be positive for galactomannan EIA in both serum and BAL fluid.</p><p>In a prospective cohort study that included 530 patients with hematologic malignancy who had signs or symptoms of invasive fungal infection, 155 (29 percent) had a positive BAL galactomannan result using an OD index threshold &ge;0.5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. BAL galactomannan had a sensitivity of 50 percent and a specificity of 73 percent for detecting proven or probable invasive aspergillosis.</p><p>It is important to note that false-positive results occur, and these are especially common in the setting in which the detection of fungi in the airways represents colonization as occurs in lung transplant recipients or when the fluid that is used for BAL washes is contaminated with galactomannan. However, one study performed in lung transplant recipients suggested that specificity is high (95 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Many centers have begun to utilize this assay on BAL fluid as an adjunct to other diagnostic tests when invasive aspergillosis is suspected. Because performance may be dependent on technical variables, such as type and amount of BAL fluid, institutions should establish specific protocols for testing.</p><p>The use of the galactomannan assay on BAL fluid from lung transplant recipients is discussed in greater detail separately.

There are several different commercial assays available in different countries. The Fungitell assay has been cleared by the FDA as an aid to diagnose invasive fungal infections. These assays utilize the same principle as serum endotoxin assays, measuring activation of Factor G. Since the different marketed tests utilize different horseshoe crab substrates and different methods to measure output, performance may be variable. The output of the serum assay currently available in the United States is based on spectrophotometer readings, in which optical density is converted to beta-D-glucan concentrations; the results are interpreted as negative (range &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL),</span> indeterminate (60 to 79 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL),</span> or positive (&gt;80 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Importantly, these cut-offs were defined in the clinical context of identifying breakthrough invasive fungal infections (primarily, invasive candidiasis) in people who were undergoing treatment for hematologic malignancies. Precise cut-offs to optimize performance of the assay as an aid to diagnose invasive aspergillosis have not been defined and may be different. In a 2011 meta-analysis that included 16 studies evaluating beta-D-glucan assays for the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections, the pooled sensitivity was 77 percent (95% CI 67-84 percent) and the pooled specificity was 85 percent (95% CI 80-90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. A 2012 meta-analysis that included six cohort studies of patients with hematologic malignancies noted a lower sensitivity (50 percent, 95% CI 34-65 percent) and a higher specificity (99 percent, 95% CI 97-100 percent) than previously reported; however, there were few cases of invasive aspergillosis tested to provide definitive conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In individual studies, the sensitivity has ranged from 55 to 95 percent and the specificity has ranged from 77 to 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/49,52-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,52-56</a>]. As in studies evaluating other fungal diagnostics, likely reasons for the differences in sensitivity and specificity between studies are that different thresholds were considered positive, different assays were used, patient populations varied, and study design was not uniform. Despite the substantial heterogeneity among different studies, the beta-D-glucan assay has good accuracy for distinguishing patients with proven or probable invasive fungal infections from patients without invasive fungal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>One study compared performance of the galactomannan EIA with the beta-D-glucan assay in sera from 105 patients with invasive aspergillosis and 50 healthy blood donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Because we inhale conidia constantly, culture isolation of <em>Aspergillus</em> species from the airway does not necessarily indicate disease. Thus, the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis is based upon both isolating the organism (or markers of the organism) and the probability that it is the cause of disease. (See <a href=\"#H1064486416\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic modalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Culture in combination with evidence of tissue invasion on histopathology or culture from a normally sterile site provides the most certain evidence of invasive aspergillosis. However, both microscopic examination and culture are insensitive, and therapy should not be withheld in the absence of such confirmation. (See <a href=\"#H1064486423\" class=\"local\">'Culture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A rational first step to establishing the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis involves the use of noninvasive modalities, such as serum biomarkers (galactomannan and beta-D-glucan assays) and obtaining sputum for fungal staining and culture. If the diagnosis is not made by these methods, a more invasive approach is indicated when feasible. Options include bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), transbronchial biopsy, computed tomography&ndash;guided transthoracic needle biopsy, and video-assisted thorascopic surgery. When BAL is performed, a sample should be sent for galactomannan antigen testing.

However, several hyaline molds including <em>Scedosporium</em> spp and <em>Fusarium </em>spp have similar appearances to <em>Aspergillus </em>spp in histopathologic sections. The treatment of infections caused by these fungi may differ, so it is important to confirm genus and species by culture.
