Defibrillation and cardioversion may be accomplished using a manual defibrillator, which requires users to recognize the dysrhythmia and preselect the energy to be delivered. Alternatively, automated external defibrillators (AEDs) may be used. AEDs are computerized machines that automatically diagnose ventricular fibrillation (VF) and use voice prompts to instruct rescuers to defibrillate, if appropriate. In addition, based on preset values for heart rate and R-wave morphology, AEDs may advise defibrillation for ventricular tachycardia (VT).</p><p>This topic will review the technique of electrical countershock, including AED use, in children. The basic principles that underlie countershock treatment; the clinical indications for these procedures and the side effects that may be seen; and the development, use, allocation, and efficacy of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are discussed separately.

Most, but not all, of these children will have suffered a respiratory arrest leading to asystole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/defibrillation-and-cardioversion-in-children-including-automated-external-defibrillation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], which is not amenable to treatment with electrical current [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/defibrillation-and-cardioversion-in-children-including-automated-external-defibrillation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As an example, in an observational study of 272 children experiencing out-of-hospital, non-traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest, 18 percent had ventricular fibrillation (VF) as the presenting rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/defibrillation-and-cardioversion-in-children-including-automated-external-defibrillation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The incidence of VF in children ages eight years and older was 27 percent; about four times greater than for younger children. In separate studies, VF was the initial rhythm in 9 percent and 19 percent of children experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/defibrillation-and-cardioversion-in-children-including-automated-external-defibrillation/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>].

Unstable supraventricular tachycardia constitutes the most common pediatric arrhythmia requiring cardioversion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of supraventricular tachycardia in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Located in the upper pole of the right atrium, the sinoatrial (SA) node serves as the site of initial electrical impulse (depolarization) during normal cardiac contraction. This wave of depolarization spreads through the atria, resulting in atrial contraction. It is then conducted in succession through the atrioventricular (AV) node, bundle of His, bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers to produce a timed and coordinated ventricular contraction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61989\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61989 \">figure 1</a>). Deflections on the electrocardiogram reflect the measurable portions of this wave of depolarization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59933\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59933 \">figure 2</a>) and correlate with cardiac activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69079\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69079 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>In patients with tachyarrhythmias or fibrillation, this normal conduction is disrupted. Electrical countershock attempts to reinstate normal cardiac depolarization and contraction. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of action'</a> below.)</p><p>Anatomically, pads or electrodes are placed on the chest so that an adequate portion of the delivered shock passes through the myocardium. The <span class=\"nowrap\">anterior/apex</span> position requires less patient movement and is typically preferred (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59094\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59094 \">figure 4</a>). However, <span class=\"nowrap\">anterior/posterior</span> pad or paddle placement is also acceptable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53963\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53963 \">figure 5</a>).

By depolarizing all excitable tissue of the circuit and making the tissue refractory, the circuit is no longer able to propagate or sustain reentry. As a result, cardioversion terminates those arrhythmias resulting from a single reentrant circuit, such as supraventricular tachycardia, atrial flutter, or monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles and technique of electrical cardioversion and defibrillation&quot;, section on 'Electrophysiology of defibrillation and cardioversion'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reentry and the development of cardiac arrhythmias&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cardioversion dosing in children is provided in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67438\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef67438 \">algorithm 1</a>) and discussed separately.

Fibrillation involves the entire atrial or ventricular myocardium and is considered to be a very recalcitrant unstable rhythm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-electrocardiogram-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The electrocardiogram in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;, section on 'Mechanism of VF'</a>.)</p><p>Dosing for ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia in children is provided in the <a href=\"https://eccguidelines.heart.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PALS-Cardiac-Arrest-Algorithm.png&amp;token=piYIABGVAf9PLq9lwQ7iekpn+CgpjoUCjUamXk/D7vMFgAEITOoqAhSlAxnx1kxx3nlTpUaXUwwGWtqdqCpPYmvUyt29VZg1Gsj9Fy/L3pJ4wzYDR5B07w+kq1tr8epP&amp;TOPIC_ID=6311\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">2015 Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Algorithm</a> and discussed separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/defibrillation-and-cardioversion-in-children-including-automated-external-defibrillation/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8573381\" class=\"local\">'Defibrillation dose'</a> below.)</p><p>Evidence suggests that a certain amount of myocardium must be available to sustain atrial or ventricular fibrillation and the entire myocardium must be uniformly depolarized in order to terminate the arrhythmia (critical mass hypothesis). However, the shock strength must also be greater than the largest shock that reinitiates fibrillation in vulnerable regions of the myocardium (the upper limit of vulnerability). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles and technique of electrical cardioversion and defibrillation&quot;, section on 'Electrophysiology of defibrillation and cardioversion'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Shock delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First-generation defibrillators were monophasic, delivering waveforms with one direction of current. Biphasic defibrillators invert the current direction in the last phase of the shock (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72878\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef72878 \">waveform 1</a>). Compared with monophasic devices, biphasic units have a greater first shock efficacy and expose the heart to less peak current. Decreasing the energy level necessary for successful defibrillation decreases the risk of burns or myocardial damage. Most manufacturers have stopped making monophasic devices although there may be some still in use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles and technique of electrical cardioversion and defibrillation&quot;, section on 'Monophasic versus biphasic waveforms'</a>.)</p><p>Regarding the frequency of electrical shocks, three stacked shocks in rapid succession are no longer recommended. Older monophasic defibrillators had a low first-shock efficacy. Three stacked shocks were recommended to decrease impedance in an attempt to increase efficacy. Newer generation biphasic defibrillators have a first-shock efficacy approaching 90 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles and technique of electrical cardioversion and defibrillation&quot;, section on 'Monophasic versus biphasic waveforms'</a>.)</p><p>Failure of defibrillation after a first shock suggests that subsequent shocks in rapid succession are also likely to fail. In this setting, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is likely to be more beneficial so a single shock should be immediately followed by resumption of CPR, not a second shock. This approach will minimize interruptions of CPR associated with pulse checks and shock delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Coordination of shock delivery and chest compressions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, patients who experience unwitnessed arrest should undergo 2 minutes of CPR prior to attempted defibrillation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric basic life support for health care providers&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since 2010, there has been a greater emphasis placed on the importance of adequate chest compressions while performing CPR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric basic life support for health care providers&quot;, section on 'Chest compressions'</a>.)</p><p>Chest compressions should be interrupted only to deliver ventilation (assuming no advanced airway), to perform rhythm checks, or to deliver shocks. During two-person CPR, 15 chest compressions should be performed followed by a brief pause to deliver 2 breaths. Further, compressions should continue while a defibrillator is charging.</p><p>There are insufficient data to know whether or not CPR prior to defibrillation improves survival for in-hospital cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/defibrillation-and-cardioversion-in-children-including-automated-external-defibrillation/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>].

The logistics involved with mobilizing a defibrillator are such that typically CPR does precede defibrillation; however, a shock should be delivered as soon as possible after an in-hospital cardiac arrest and CPR should be resumed immediately after attempted defibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/defibrillation-and-cardioversion-in-children-including-automated-external-defibrillation/abstract/8,9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,12</a>].</p><p>The AHA guidelines for pediatric basic and advanced life support also emphasize that chest compressions should be hard (eg, at least one-third of the anterior-posterior diameter of the chest) and fast (eg, 100 per minute). The rescuer should allow for complete chest recoil after a compression and minimize interruptions between compressions.

Prior to electrical discharge, all bystanders and the rescuer should ensure that they are not in contact with the patient or the stretcher. In prehospital settings, the patient should be moved from wet, soaked ground or standing water before receiving electric countershock. Of note, reports of inadvertent shocks to bystanders have demonstrated only minor adverse outcomes, such as tingling in the involved extremity, transient lethargy, or minor burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/defibrillation-and-cardioversion-in-children-including-automated-external-defibrillation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

This hazard can be reduced by using electrode pads instead of hand-held paddles for shock delivery and by ensuring that oxygen delivery devices are at least 1 m away from the patient during electric countershock.

If paddles are used, they must be applied with considerable, firm and steady pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59094\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59094 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>Alternatively, an <span class=\"nowrap\">anterior/posterior</span> pad or paddle placement may be used with the anterior pad or paddle applied with the center of the paddle slightly to the left of the sternum and the posterior pad or paddle applied to the middle of the upper back (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53963\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53963 \">figure 5</a>). This position may be preferred if adult electrodes must be used to deliver a countershock to an infant &lt;10 kg because infant paddles are unavailable. In this situation, the <span class=\"nowrap\">anterior/posterior</span> placement avoids the possibility of the large paddles contacting each other during shock delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrode-chest interface</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A flow of electrical current is needed for successful defibrillation. A high, transthoracic impedance will decrease the likelihood of success. When using paddles, concurrent use of conductive materials, such as electrode cream or paste will decrease transthoracic impedance.</p><p>Paddles and electrode pads must not contact each other and care must be taken to avoid interface materials on one side of the chest contacting the material placed on the opposite side. Either of these conditions can result in arcing of the electrical current across the chest wall rather than conduction toward the heart.</p><p>Interface materials to be avoided include saline, isopropyl alcohol, and ultrasound gel as well as the use of bare paddles. In addition to lower efficacy, isopropyl alcohol poses a risk of fire.

The currently recommended doses are based on a small study of just 27 children that was performed decades ago [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/defibrillation-and-cardioversion-in-children-including-automated-external-defibrillation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

As an example, an observational study of 266 children with 285 in-hospital events warranting defibrillation found that an initial shock dose of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/kg</span> resulted in termination of <span class=\"nowrap\">VF/pVT</span> in only 55 percent of children and that increasing the initial dose was <strong>not</strong> associated with a greater likelihood of termination of <span class=\"nowrap\">VF/pVT</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/defibrillation-and-cardioversion-in-children-including-automated-external-defibrillation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Furthermore, the 52 patients who received initial shock doses of 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/kg</span> were less likely to have termination of <span class=\"nowrap\">VF/pVT</span> or to survive the event when compared to the 186 children who received 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/kg</span> (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.42 [95% CI 0.18-0.98] for termination of <span class=\"nowrap\">VF/pVT</span> and adjusted OR 0.41 [95% CI 0.21-0.81] for event survival).

The most recent AHA and international guidelines state that AEDs may be used for shock delivery in infants and children for treatment of out-of-hospital VF or pulseless VT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/defibrillation-and-cardioversion-in-children-including-automated-external-defibrillation/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The order of preference for device is as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/defibrillation-and-cardioversion-in-children-including-automated-external-defibrillation/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(1) Manual defibrillator</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(2) AED with a dose attenuator device for children under eight years of age</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(3) AED without a dose attenuator</p><p/><p>Several recent advances in AED technology have allowed for their pediatric use. Studies show that AEDs are highly accurate in detecting abnormal rhythms in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/defibrillation-and-cardioversion-in-children-including-automated-external-defibrillation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

A second advance is the development of attenuation devices, such as pads and cables which decrease the energy delivered to children.</p><p>For in-hospital defibrillation, there are no data comparing manual defibrillators with AEDs in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/defibrillation-and-cardioversion-in-children-including-automated-external-defibrillation/abstract/7,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10,11</a>], nor are there clear guidelines specifying the use of one over the other. The AHA does state that &quot;AEDs may be considered for the hospital setting as a way to facilitate early defibrillation (a goal of &le;3 minutes from collapse), especially in areas where staff have no rhythm recognition skills or defibrillators are used infrequently&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/defibrillation-and-cardioversion-in-children-including-automated-external-defibrillation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Thus, for defibrillation of infants and children, institution-specific practices will prevail and a clinician may use either a manual defibrillator or an AED with a pediatric dose attenuation device.</p><p>A large cohort study that evaluated the use of AEDs for hospitalized adults who suffered a sudden cardiac arrest found no survival benefit in adults with shockable rhythms and worse outcomes for adults without a shockable rhythm who were treated with an AED. Use of the automated external defibrillators (AED) in adults is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=automated-external-defibrillators#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Automated external defibrillators&quot;, section on 'In-hospital AED allocation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Automated external defibrillator operation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A principle reason for the growing prevalence of AEDs in society is their ease of use. The typical AED provides voice prompts for each step in its use after the machine is turned on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply adhesive electrode pads supplied with the machine. The electrode size and placement are the same as with manual defibrillators. As noted earlier, pediatric attenuated electrodes should be used in patients under eight years of age.

A standard AED without a dose attenuator is recommended for children older than eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/defibrillation-and-cardioversion-in-children-including-automated-external-defibrillation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. For those under eight years of age, an initial pediatric attenuated dose should be given. These attenuation devices will decrease the delivered dose to 35 to 50 J depending on the specific AED; some will allow higher doses for subsequent shocks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/defibrillation-and-cardioversion-in-children-including-automated-external-defibrillation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Note that dosing is not weight-based.

The energy dose needed to produce histologic damage to myocardium is many times greater than that needed to defibrillate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/defibrillation-and-cardioversion-in-children-including-automated-external-defibrillation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Thus, a standard AED without a dose attenuator is acceptable for infants and younger children, if it is the only device available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/defibrillation-and-cardioversion-in-children-including-automated-external-defibrillation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inappropriate defibrillation of a patient with a perfusing, organized rhythm may cause ventricular fibrillation.</p><p>Oxygen use represents an important fire hazard when electrical current is being delivered. A not infrequent scenario is for a patient in arrest to receive 100 percent oxygen via bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation. At the moment of shock delivery, the BVM apparatus may be placed such that oxygen is blowing across the patient's chest. This represents a significant fire hazard if a spark from a poorly placed paddle contacts the oxygen. All oxygen sources must be removed at least 1 m from the patient before defibrillation.</p><p>Although uncommon, other potential dose-related complications include arrhythmias, myocardial injury, or skin burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/defibrillation-and-cardioversion-in-children-including-automated-external-defibrillation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].
