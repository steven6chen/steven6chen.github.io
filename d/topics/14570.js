In most children, psoriasis can be adequately treated with topical medications. However, children with moderate to severe psoriasis often require phototherapy or systemic therapy.</p><p>Although many of the therapies commonly administered for psoriasis in children and adults are similar, high-quality efficacy and safety trials to guide the best approach to psoriasis in children are more limited. As a result, the development of guidelines for the treatment of pediatric psoriasis is challenging. In clinical practice, consideration of patient-specific factors, such as patient age, severity of disease, comorbidities, and tolerance of the risks and side effects of specific medications, guides the approach to treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115504\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115504 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>The management of chronic plaque psoriasis, the most common clinical variant of psoriasis in children, will be reviewed here. The diagnosis of psoriasis in children and the approach to treatment of other clinical variants of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are reviewed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriasis-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psoriasis in children: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guttate-psoriasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guttate psoriasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pustular-psoriasis-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pustular psoriasis: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nail-psoriasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nail psoriasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psoriatic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psoriatic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H858167214\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The severity of psoriasis influences the approach to treatment. Most children have mild to moderate psoriasis, which often can be adequately treated with topical medications such as corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and vitamin D analogs. Approximately 10 to 20 percent of children have moderate to severe psoriasis, defined as psoriasis that involves more than 10 percent of the body surface area or psoriasis that cannot be adequately improved with topical therapy. Moderate to severe psoriasis often requires phototherapy or systemic therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115504\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115504 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>Other patient-specific factors can influence treatment selection. The concomitant presence of psoriatic arthritis can justify use of systemic antipsoriatic therapy in children with mild skin involvement, and modifications to the therapeutic approach are indicated when treating very young children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psoriatic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Management and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H2976775464\" class=\"local\">'Very young children'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2162888598\"><span class=\"h1\">MILD TO MODERATE PLAQUE PSORIASIS IN CHILDREN AT LEAST FOUR YEARS OF AGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild to moderate plaque psoriasis is generally defined as psoriasis involving less than 10 percent of the total body surface area. Given the limited amount of skin involvement, topical therapy is usually manageable for patients and their caregivers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115504\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115504 \">algorithm 1</a>). Modifications for treating psoriasis in special sites, including the face, intertriginous skin, and scalp, are reviewed below. (See <a href=\"#H105398802\" class=\"local\">'Face and intertriginous skin'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3870085971\" class=\"local\">'Scalp'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H771277443\"><span class=\"h2\">First-line therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay for pediatric psoriasis based upon the extensive clinical experience that supports efficacy for this indication and wide availability and affordability of some of these agents. However, long-term corticosteroid therapy is associated with increased risk for side effects such as skin atrophy. Thus, nonsteroidal topical agents (eg, topical calcineurin inhibitors, topical vitamin D analogs) are often added to (or substituted for) topical corticosteroid therapy to reduce corticosteroid exposure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3592184620\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plaque psoriasis usually responds to topical corticosteroid therapy provided the agent selected has adequate potency.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Administration</strong> &ndash; Psoriasis plaques on the trunk and extremities in children can be treated with high-potency to medium-potency (group 2 to 4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>)) topical corticosteroids applied twice daily. Signs of improvement (reduced erythema and plaque thickness) are sometimes evident within the first one to two weeks, with additional improvement occurring with continued use. We continue daily treatment for up to four weeks. Once sufficient improvement occurs, the topical corticosteroid can be discontinued or tapered to intermittent use (two consecutive days per week [eg, weekends]) to maintain the response, if needed. Daily application for up to four weeks is resumed for subsequent flares.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If psoriasis plaques on the trunk or extremities do not respond sufficiently within four weeks of daily treatment with a group 2 to 4 topical corticosteroid, a short course (&le;2 weeks) of a super-high potency (group 1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>)) topical corticosteroid may lead to improvement. After two weeks of use, application should be tapered to intermittent use (eg, two consecutive days per week). Alternatively, the patient can be transitioned to a lower potency corticosteroid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We often incorporate a vitamin D analog in the treatment regimen when feasible. Patients or caregivers can apply the vitamin D analog simultaneously with the topical corticosteroid during treatment of acute flares. Once the frequency of topical corticosteroid application is reduced to two days per week, application of the topical vitamin D analog may continue on the remaining five days. (See <a href=\"#H2794233824\" class=\"local\">'Topical vitamin D analogs'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Topical corticosteroids are available in a wide variety of vehicles (eg, ointment, cream, lotion, gel, solution, spray, foam). In general, ointments are preferred over other vehicles to enhance penetration of psoriatic scale. However, patient preferences and certain sites (eg, hair-bearing scalp) warrant consideration of other vehicles to maximize the likelihood of adherence to therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3870085971\" class=\"local\">'Scalp'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Inadequate penetration of topical corticosteroids can lead to poor responses in children with markedly hyperkeratotic plaques. Compounding topical corticosteroids with keratolytics, like 6% salicylic acid, with or without topical tar can facilitate treatment of these plaques. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Topical corticosteroids should be used with caution on facial and intertriginous skin due to increased risk for cutaneous side effects. Use of medium to high-potency topical corticosteroids should be avoided in these areas. (See <a href=\"#H105398802\" class=\"local\">'Face and intertriginous skin'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Use of topical corticosteroids for pediatric psoriasis is primarily based upon extensive clinical experience that supports efficacy of these agents and data from randomized trials in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-management-of-chronic-plaque-psoriasis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. There is a paucity of randomized trial data in children. In a phase 3 randomized trial that compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clobetasol</a> emulsion formulation foam with vehicle and clobetasol ointment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in individuals 12 years and older, among participants ages 12 to 17 years, two of eight children in the clobetasol foam group compared with zero of one children in the vehicle group achieved clearance or near clearance after two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-management-of-chronic-plaque-psoriasis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adverse effects and precautions</strong> &ndash; Cutaneous atrophy and striae are potential side effects of topical corticosteroid therapy. Risk for these side effects can be reduced by limiting the duration of application, avoiding excessive application (thin layer is sufficient), and avoiding use of potent corticosteroids on the face and intertriginous areas. (See <a href=\"#H105398802\" class=\"local\">'Face and intertriginous skin'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids may also lead to hypothalamic pituitary axis suppression, particularly in children. To minimize risk of this side effect, avoidance of long-term daily use of topical corticosteroids on large skin areas is prudent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of dermatologic therapy and topical corticosteroid use&quot;, section on 'Systemic'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3600352513\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical calcineurin inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical calcineurin inhibitors are an additional first-line treatment option for psoriasis in children. These agents are primarily used as an alternative to topical corticosteroid therapy for psoriasis in sites with the greatest risk for corticosteroid-induced skin atrophy, including the face and intertriginous areas. (See <a href=\"#H105398802\" class=\"local\">'Face and intertriginous skin'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2794233824\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical vitamin D analogs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical vitamin D analogs utilized for psoriasis include calcipotriene, calcitriol, and tacalcitol. Tacalcitol is not available in the United States. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Administration</strong> &ndash; The onset of action of topical vitamin D analogs is relatively slow (six to eight weeks). Thus, these agents are generally used in conjunction with or after faster-acting topical corticosteroid therapy. Common regimens include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>As adjunctive treatment: Simultaneous, twice daily application with a potent corticosteroid. Patients may mix the two agents in their hands prior to application or use a commercially available combination medication (eg, calcipotriene 0.005% and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">betamethasone</a> dipropionate 0.064%).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>As a corticosteroid-sparing agent: Twice daily application of the topical vitamin D analog five days per week (eg, Monday to Friday) and application of a topical corticosteroid two days per week (eg, weekends).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy</strong> &ndash; Topical vitamin D analogs have demonstrated efficacy and safety in randomized trials in adults with psoriasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Topical vitamin D analogs'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Randomized trial data in children are limited. In an eight-week randomized trial in which 77 children with psoriasis (&lt;30 percent body surface area involvement, ages 2 to 14 years) were randomly assigned to apply either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcipotriol-calcipotriene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcipotriol</a> ointment or vehicle twice daily, greater reductions in redness and scaliness occurred in the calcipotriol group than in the placebo group, but significant differences in plaque thickness and the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score were not observed between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-management-of-chronic-plaque-psoriasis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Uncontrolled studies also suggest benefit in children with plaque psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-management-of-chronic-plaque-psoriasis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adverse effects and precautions</strong> &ndash; Topical vitamin D analogs are generally well tolerated. Skin irritation is a potential side effect that can limit use in some children. Reversible hypercalcemia is an additional potential side effect when topical vitamin D analogs are used on large areas of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1238211407\"><span class=\"h3\">Emollients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The application of emollients is an important adjunctive measure for psoriasis. Moisturizing the skin can make scale less prominent and reduce pruritus and fissuring. Emollients may also help to minimize the Koebner phenomenon (occurrence of new psoriasis plaques in sites of skin trauma) through reducing the likelihood of skin irritation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2345504424\"><span class=\"h2\">Other therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other topical agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tazarotene-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tazarotene</a>, tar, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anthralin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anthralin</a>, are less frequently used for pediatric psoriasis because of side effects. Skin irritation often limits the use of tazarotene and anthralin in children. Tar is malodorous and can stain skin and clothing. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tazarotene-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Tazarotene</a> &ndash; Although randomized trial data support the efficacy of once daily application of tazarotene for plaque psoriasis in adults, such data are lacking in children. A case report describes successful treatment of nail psoriasis in a child with tazarotene 0.05% [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-management-of-chronic-plaque-psoriasis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Tazarotene'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tar</strong> &ndash; Tar has anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects that can lead to improvement in psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-management-of-chronic-plaque-psoriasis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Tar is commercially available in a variety of products, including coal tar-containing solutions (liquid carbonis detergens [LCD]), crude <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coal-tar-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">coal tar</a>, coal tar extract, coal tar distillate, and tar blends [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-management-of-chronic-plaque-psoriasis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, tar may be compounded with topical corticosteroids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> salicylic acid. Its objectionable smell, tendency to stain skin and clothing, and associated risk for folliculitis make tar a less appealing treatment option for psoriasis on the face, trunk, or extremities. However, coal tar is commonly used in shampoo formulations for scalp psoriasis. (See <a href=\"#H3870085971\" class=\"local\">'Scalp'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Tar'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anthralin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Anthralin</a><strong> </strong>&ndash; Similar to tar, anthralin, or dithranol, has antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory effects and can improve psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-management-of-chronic-plaque-psoriasis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Anthralin is applied for increasing lengths of time, as tolerated, until effectiveness is achieved. Anthralin can cause skin irritation and may stain skin and clothing, making it a less desirable treatment. Use of anthralin is uncommon in the United States; the drug is more frequently used in Europe. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults#H2134335\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Anthralin'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2665648844\"><span class=\"h2\">Special sites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Facial, intertriginous, and scalp involvement are common in children with psoriasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113323%7EDERM%2F113138\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113323 graphicRef113138 \">picture 1C-D</a>). Modifying the approach to treatment for these areas is helpful for maximizing results and minimizing side effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105398802\"><span class=\"h3\">Face and intertriginous skin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors are effective for facial and intertriginous psoriasis and are commonly used for these indications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113323\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113323 \">picture 1C</a>). Topical calcineurin inhibitors are favored for long-term treatment of these sites given the elevated risk for corticosteroid-induced skin atrophy in these areas. However, topical calcineurin inhibitors are typically more expensive than topical corticosteroids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of dermatologic therapy and topical corticosteroid use&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Administration</strong> &ndash; When treating facial or intertriginous psoriasis in children, we generally initiate treatment with a topical calcineurin inhibitor (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tacrolimus</a> 0.1% ointment or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimecrolimus-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">pimecrolimus</a> 1% cream). Tacrolimus is also available as a 0.03% ointment; we typically reserve use of the 0.03% ointment for children who cannot tolerate the 0.1% formulation due to skin irritation. The topical calcineurin inhibitor is applied twice daily until satisfactory improvement. Improvement is expected within the first month of treatment. Once resolution has occurred, treatment can be stopped. Application is resumed upon recurrence of disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alternatively, topical corticosteroids can be used for psoriasis on the face or intertriginous skin. The agent selected should have a low potency (group 6 or 7). The corticosteroid is applied twice daily for up to two weeks. If sufficient improvement is obtained, treatment can be stopped with the plan to resume treatment during subsequent flares. If the response is insufficient or disease recurs rapidly (eg, within a few weeks), we favor transitioning the patient to topical calcineurin inhibitor therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Although randomized trials support the efficacy of topical calcineurin inhibitors for facial and intertriginous psoriasis in adults, there are no randomized trials evaluating these agents for psoriasis in children. A six-month uncontrolled study that evaluated the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tacrolimus</a> 0.1% ointment for facial or inverse psoriasis in 11 children (ages 6 to 15 years) supports benefit in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-management-of-chronic-plaque-psoriasis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Among the eight patients who completed the study, all improved, with the most improvement occurring within the first 30 days. By day 30, one patient achieved complete clearance, and the remainder had excellent improvement. Successful treatment of facial or genital psoriasis in children with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimecrolimus-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">pimecrolimus</a> cream is documented in case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-management-of-chronic-plaque-psoriasis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Calcineurin inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adverse effects and precautions</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Topical calcineurin inhibitor therapy is generally well tolerated. Transient burning sensations, erythema, and pruritus are the most common side effects. Concerns have been raised regarding the long-term safety of calcineurin inhibitors, particularly in regard to cancer risk. However, a causative relationship between these agents and malignancy has not been established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema)&quot;, section on 'Long-term safety concerns'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3870085971\"><span class=\"h3\">Scalp</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although scalp psoriasis will typically respond to the same topical medications as plaque psoriasis on the trunk or extremities, the presence of abundant terminal hair demands consideration of the best way to deliver therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113138\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113138 \">picture 1D</a>). Topical corticosteroids, topical vitamin D analogs, tar, and keratolytics are commonly used for therapy.</p><p>Often, patients find medications in shampoos, foams, solutions, gels, sprays, or oils preferable for application to the scalp.

The topical agents used for milder disease are often used in conjunction with phototherapy and systemic therapy to maximize the response to therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2162888598\" class=\"local\">'Mild to moderate plaque psoriasis in children at least four years of age'</a> above.) </p><p>Oral corticosteroid therapy should be avoided due to the potential for precipitating severe psoriasis flares upon withdrawal. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1104304340\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidelines on the therapeutic approach to moderate to severe psoriasis in children are lacking. Selection among the available treatments is dependent upon consideration of patient-specific factors such as severity of disease, comorbidities, tolerance of risks and side effects, and prior treatment history (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115504\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115504 \">algorithm 1</a>). Our general approach to psoriasis in children over the age of four years is outlined here. Other approaches may be reasonable. Special considerations for younger children are reviewed below. (See <a href=\"#H2976775464\" class=\"local\">'Very young children'</a> below.)</p><p>Although topical therapy is frequently inadequate for children with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, we typically attempt topical therapy (eg, trial of combination therapy with a potent topical corticosteroid and topical vitamin D analog for two to three months) prior to initiating other interventions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115504\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115504 \">algorithm 1</a>). This allows us to identify those children for whom topical therapy is inadequate. (See <a href=\"#H771277443\" class=\"local\">'First-line therapies'</a> above.)</p><p>Our most frequent initial therapies for pediatric plaque psoriasis that cannot be managed with topical therapy are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methotrexate</a>, narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">etanercept</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">adalimumab</a>. Globally, methotrexate is the most common systemic medication used for psoriasis in children. Advantages of methotrexate include a long history of use for pediatric psoriasis, availability of an oral formulation, and low cost compared with other psoriasis therapies. Disadvantages of methotrexate include a relatively slow onset of action, the need for laboratory monitoring during treatment, and the potentially serious side effect of hepatotoxicity. In addition, methotrexate may be less effective than some biologic agents. A randomized trial found methotrexate inferior to adalimumab for severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-management-of-chronic-plaque-psoriasis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Of note, the average methotrexate dose given in the trial was relatively low. (See <a href=\"#H2548936404\" class=\"local\">'Biologic agents'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Systemic therapies'</a>.)</p><p>Ideal candidates for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methotrexate</a> therapy are children with relatively stable psoriasis who can tolerate a delayed onset of action, can tolerate laboratory monitoring, and lack risk factors for methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity. Methotrexate should be used with caution in female adolescents due to risk for teratogenicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults#H32\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Hepatotoxicity and liver biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>Our favored use of phototherapy for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is based upon the absence of risk for the serious systemic side effects that may occur with systemic therapies. However, phototherapy requires frequent office visits (unless home phototherapy is implemented), which is difficult for some families, and phototherapy is not recommended for very young children. In addition, there is some uncertainty regarding long-term risk for skin cancer in children treated with narrowband UVB phototherapy. Ideal candidates for narrowband UVB phototherapy are children who can come for frequent visits and who are old enough to follow instructions and safely remain in a light booth alone. We typically consider phototherapy in children over the age of six years (most commonly, preadolescents and adolescents), although even young children can be treated when a parent accompanies the child in the booth and can provide entertainment. Phototherapy is also a useful option for children and families who desire to avoid systemic therapy. </p><p>Emerging data suggest that biologic agents are safer and more effective than nonspecific immunosuppressants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclosporine</a>) for pediatric psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-management-of-chronic-plaque-psoriasis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. We often use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">etanercept</a> as our first-line biologic agent given that it is the biologic agent with the longest history of use in children with psoriasis.

However, the drug has the potential for serious adverse effects and is generally reserved for children with acute, severe flares of disease that require immediate relief and severe psoriasis types such as acute generalized pustular psoriasis and erythrodermic psoriasis. The side effects of cyclosporine limit the recommended duration of therapy to less than one year. The low cost of cyclosporine compared with biologic therapy is an advantage of this therapy.</p><p>Oral retinoids can be effective for psoriasis but are less favored for chronic plaque psoriasis based upon lower efficacy as monotherapy compared with other agents. Advantages of oral retinoids include oral administration and lack of immunosuppression. Teratogenicity of oral retinoids is a concern for female adolescent patients, particularly for treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a>.

Phototherapy options include narrowband UVB and targeted phototherapy with the excimer laser. Of these, narrowband UVB is more commonly used for the treatment of children. The excimer laser provides the advantage of minimizing exposure of unaffected skin to UVB, but data on the efficacy and safety of the excimer laser in children are limited. Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) phototherapy is rarely used in children due to concern for greater risk for side effects compared with narrowband UVB.

For children with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis (psoriasis involving less than 10 percent of the body surface area), we recommend topical agents as initial therapy rather than systemic therapy or phototherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment. Topical calcineurin inhibitors and topical vitamin D analogs are additional common treatments. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tazarotene-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Tazarotene</a>, tar, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anthralin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anthralin</a> are less frequently used topical treatments.

Topical calcineurin inhibitors are commonly used as first-line agents for the treatment of facial and intertriginous psoriasis because of increased risk for topical corticosteroid-induced skin atrophy in these areas. For scalp psoriasis, it is important to select drug vehicles that the child <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> caregivers find acceptable for use in the hair.
