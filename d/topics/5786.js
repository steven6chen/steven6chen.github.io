Low voltage of <strong>all</strong> leads is diagnosed when the average voltage in the limb leads is &lt;5 mm and the average voltage in the chest leads is &lt;10 mm. This may be due to underlying myocardial disease (particularly amyloidosis), pericardial effusion, lung disease, severe hypothyroidism, obesity, or anasarca, in which the low voltage correlates with weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ecg-tutorial-miscellaneous-diagnoses/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY REPOLARIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term early repolarization (ER), also known as &quot;J-waves&quot; or &quot;J-point elevation,&quot; has long been used to characterize a QRS-T variant on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Most literature defines ER as being present on the ECG when there is J-point elevation of &ge;0.1 mV in two adjacent leads with either a slurred or notched morphology. Historically, ER has been considered a marker of good health because it is more prevalent in athletes, younger persons, and at slower heart rates. However, newer reports have suggested a small association between ER and an increased risk for arrhythmic death and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. Early repolarization is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-repolarization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early repolarization&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTRICAL ALTERNANS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrical alternans is recognized by alternating amplitude of the QRS complexes in any or all leads (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51502\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef51502 \">waveform 2</a>). Every other QRS complex has reduced amplitude alternating with increased amplitude. Most often it is observed in the precordial leads where the QRS amplitude is greater.</p><p>The most frequent cause of electrical alternans is a pericardial effusion; it is thought that the alternating amplitude is the result of a pendulum motion of the heart as it &quot;swings&quot; from beat to beat within the fluid contained in the pericardial sac; there is a change in electrical axis as the heart swings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion#H4463173\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pericardial effusion&quot;, section on 'ECG findings'</a>.) Frequently, there is also sinus tachycardia when there is electrical alternans from pericardial effusion. Electrical alternans may also be seen when there is severe cardiomegaly and left ventricular dysfunction or with aortic regurgitation.</p><p>Another setting associated with electrical alternans is supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), especially when the rate is rapid. Although it has been suggested that electrical alternans during SVT is indicative of atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia, this finding can be seen in any rapid SVT.</p><p>There may also be macrovolt alternans of the T waves, although this is less common. It is most often seen with long QT syndrome and is a warning sign of impending polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital long QT syndrome: Epidemiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a>.) </p><p>U wave alternans is very uncommon and is associated with electrolyte disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY OR LATE TRANSITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual transition zone, where the R and S wave are equal in amplitude in the precordial leads, usually occurs between V3 and V4. Early or late transition may occur due to a variety of circumstances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Early transition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The so-called &ldquo;counterclockwise rotation&rdquo; pattern is present when there is early transition of the R wave amplitude across the precordium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79702\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef79702 \">waveform 3</a>). It may be a normal variant or be due to lead placement, Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern, muscular dystrophies, right ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular conduction delays, or a true posterior wall myocardial infarction (MI). The finding of Q waves and ST segment changes in leads V7 to V9 is helpful in diagnosing a posterior wall MI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Myocardial ischemia and infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrocardiogram in the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia and infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An understanding of the electrocardiographic manifestations of a counterclockwise rotation involves imagining the heart as viewed from below the diaphragm. The right ventricle is anterior, and the left ventricle is leftward and slightly posterior. If the electrical axis of the heart is rotated in a counterclockwise direction around a central axis, the left ventricle is shifted more anteriorly. Thus, tall R waves are seen earlier than normal across the precordium, in lead V2 or even V1.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SLOW (&quot;POOR&quot;) R WAVE PROGRESSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The R wave height normally becomes progressively taller from leads V1 through V6. In V1 to V3, there is an R wave of low amplitude and an S wave that is larger <span class=\"nowrap\">(R/S</span> &lt;1); between leads V3 to V4, there is a transition to an R wave that has a greater amplitude than the S wave <span class=\"nowrap\">(R/S</span> &gt;1). When the R wave height does not become progressively taller from leads V1 to V3 or V4, or even remains at low amplitude across the entire precordium, slow or poor R wave progression (PRWP) is present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58053\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef58053 \">waveform 4</a>). Several sets of criteria have been proposed to define PRWP more precisely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ecg-tutorial-miscellaneous-diagnoses/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>There are many etiologies for PRWP:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lead placement </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anteroseptal or anterior wall myocardial infarction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left ventricular hypertrophy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left anterior fascicular block</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left bundle branch block</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infiltrative or dilated cardiomyopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wolff-Parkinson-White patterns due to right-sided or antero-septal bypass tracts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic lung disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physiologic late transition or clockwise rotation of the heart</p><p/><p>Poor R wave progression may be more frequently seen in females.

The J point is occasionally depressed, but more commonly seen is depression or sagging of the ST segment, which is concave in an upward direction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56737\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef56737 \">waveform 5</a>). These changes are more apparent in the lateral precordial leads, although they may also be seen in the limb leads.</p><p>Other changes associated with digitalis include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The T waves are often flattened and the QT interval (ST segment) shortened</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Usually, the PR interval is slightly prolonged as a result of an enhanced vagal effect upon the atrioventricular node.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some cases, there are abnormalities of the U wave (prominent or inverted), which may be due to digitalis itself, or can be secondary to hypokalemia.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIGITALIS TOXICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Digitalis toxicity may have various electrocardiographic manifestations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-arrhythmias-due-to-digoxin-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac arrhythmias due to digoxin toxicity&quot;</a>.) Toxicity leads to an increase in central sympathetic neural activity, thereby causing an increase in myocardial automaticity and excitability and an increase in peripheral vagal tone; the latter effect causes suppression of the normal pacemaker tissue in the sinus and atrioventricular node. Thus, there may be arrhythmic disturbances, conduction block, or a combination of both.</p><p>Abnormal rhythms due to digitalis toxicity include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular premature beats</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial tachycardia (automatic, accelerated, or non-paroxysmal)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accelerated junctional rhythm or tachycardia (automatic or non-paroxysmal)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accelerated idioventricular rhythm (automatic or non-paroxysmal)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular tachycardia, including bidirectional ventricular tachycardia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular fibrillation</p><p/><p>Abnormal conduction due to digitalis toxicity includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinus bradycardia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinus pauses or arrest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinoatrial exit block</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First degree atrioventricular block</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second degree atrioventricular block (especially, Mobitz I) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Third degree atrioventricular block</p><p/><p>Combined arrhythmia and conduction abnormalities due to digitalis toxicity include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial tachycardia with atrioventricular block (paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with block) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68731\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef68731 \">waveform 6</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinus bradycardia associated with junctional tachycardia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accelerated junctional rhythm associated with underlying atrial fibrillation (regularized atrial fibrillation).</p><p/><p>Thus, almost any arrhythmia or conduction abnormality may be seen with digitalis toxicity.

A variety of conduction disturbances, including right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, bifascicular block, and advanced atrioventricular (AV) block, may be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ecg-tutorial-miscellaneous-diagnoses/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The P wave may flatten or disappear as a result of atrial standstill or arrest; however, sinus node activity can persist without resulting in atrial activation.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brugada-syndrome-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brugada syndrome: Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultimately the QRS widens further due to a severe conduction delay and may become &quot;sine wave,&quot; resulting in ventricular standstill and a flat line on the ECG with complete absence of electrical activity.</p><p/><p>The progression and severity of ECG changes do <strong>not</strong> correlate well with the serum potassium concentration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypokalemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to hyperkalemia, hypokalemia produces changes on the ECG that are not necessarily related to the serum potassium level. There is depression of the ST segment, decrease in the amplitude of the T wave, and an increase in the amplitude of the U wave, best seen in leads V4 to V6 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73888\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef73888 \">waveform 8</a>). U waves are often seen in the lateral precordial leads V4 to V6.</p><p>Other findings associated with hypokalemia include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The U wave and T wave merge in some cases to form a T-U wave, which may be misdiagnosed as a prolonged QT interval.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The P wave can become larger and wider and the PR interval may prolong slightly</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The QRS duration may increase when the hypokalemia is more severe; in addition, the ST segment becomes markedly depressed, and T waves are inverted.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypocalcemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypocalcemia causes prolongation of the QT interval (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59063\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef59063 \">waveform 9</a>). This is due to prolongation of phase 2 of the ventricular action potential and lengthening of the ST segment, while the T wave (which correlates with the time for repolarization) remains unaltered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypercalcemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypercalcemia causes shortening of the QT interval, primarily due to a decrease in phase 2 of the ventricular action potential and resultant decrease in the ST segment duration. There is also a decrease in duration of the proximal portion of the T wave, or upstroke, measured from the beginning of the T wave to its apex; thus, the initial portion of the T wave has an abrupt upslope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82086\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef82086 \">waveform 10</a>). Other findings in some patients include PR prolongation, a diffuse increase in the amplitude of the QRS complex, ST elevation in V1 to V2, and flattened, inverted, or biphasic T waves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">DEXTROCARDIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dextrocardia is a condition in which the heart is located on the right side of the chest. Thus, the left ventricular apex is at the right midclavicular line. The resultant changes on the electrocardiogram often include a negative P wave and QRS complex in lead 1, since atrial and ventricular depolarization begin on the left and spread to the right. There is also reverse R wave progression across the precordium; the R wave is tallest in V1 and progressively decreases in amplitude in leads V2 to V6 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F60496\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef60496 \">waveform 11</a>). The diagnosis may be confirmed by obtaining right-sided chest leads that demonstrate the normal progression of R wave amplitude.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPOTHERMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypothermia, defined as a temperature of less than 93 degrees (F) or 34 degrees (C), slows impulse conduction through all cardiac tissue, resulting in prolongation of all the electrocardiogram intervals, including the RR, PR, QRS, and QT. There is also elevation of the J point (only if the ST segment is unaltered), producing a characteristic J or Osborne wave, which represents distortion of the earliest phase of membrane repolarization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80836\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef80836 \">waveform 12</a>). The height of the Osborne wave is roughly proportional to the degree of hypothermia. These findings are most prominent in the precordial leads V2 to V5.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">ARTIFACT DUE TO TREMOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tremors can cause a rhythmic irregularity of the electrocardiogram (ECG) baseline and occasionally the QRS complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62575\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef62575 \">waveform 13</a>). They may mimic atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, or ventricular tachycardia. This abnormality is commonly seen in Parkinson disease or hypothermia. Counting the peaks of the artifact helps determine the periodicity of the muscle tremor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">LEAD SWITCH OR MISPLACEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Placement of the electrocardiographic leads on the wrong limbs or incorrect positioning of the precordial leads may cause an abnormal P wave and QRS axis in the frontal plane or unusual R wave progression. This may be confused with dextrocardia, a pathologic left or rightward axis, or myocardial infarction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">FUSION COMPLEXES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fusion complexes are combination beats that result when two impulses simultaneously activate the same territory of the atrial or ventricular myocardium and &quot;fuse&quot; with each other (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72600\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef72600 \">waveform 14</a>). The resultant complex is a hybrid, or intermediate in shape, with features of the patterns produced by each of the complexes. Ventricular fusion is seen when a ventricular complex is generated and begins to activate the ventricular myocardium shortly after a supraventricular impulse has been conducted through the atrioventricular node and has also begun to spread through the ventricular myocardium. In order for a sinus impulse to fuse with a ventricular premature beat, the premature beat must occur late enough to follow the P wave of the sinus beat.</p><p>Fusion beats are often seen during sustained ventricular tachycardia; occasionally, the fusion will result in complete, but episodic and transient normalization of the QRS complex, which has a morphology that resembles the complex seen in sinus rhythm. This is known as a capture or Dressler beat. Often, an episode of ventricular tachycardia or an accelerated idioventricular rhythm will begin or end with a fusion beat.</p><p>Fusion beats are also frequently seen when there is a permanent pacemaker. Fusion complexes in the ventricle occur as a result of simultaneous activation from the native conduction system and from the pacemaker. This shows a pacemaker spike at the beginning of or just after the start of the QRS.</p><p>The typical QRS complex seen in the Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome represents a fused beat with early activation occurring via the bundle of Kent and activation of the ventricle via the normal His-Purkinje conduction system. The end result is a short PR interval and fused QRS complex with a sloped delta wave.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">RECIPROCAL (ECHO) COMPLEXES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reciprocal or echo beats occur when a premature ventricular complex is conducted retrogradely to the atrium (ventriculoatrial conduction). Retrograde atrial activation occurs via the atrioventricular (AV) node when dual pathways are present or as a result of an accessory bypass tract such as in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The resulting atrial impulse is then conducted antegradely back to the ventricle via the normal conduction pathway (the AV node and His Purkinje system). Generally, a premature ventricular complex is followed by a retrograde P wave (which may be inverted), which is then conducted antegradely through the AV node and results in a normal QRS complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62909\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef62909 \">waveform 15</a>). The PR interval is usually increased.</p><p>Echo beats may be seen when there is a pacemaker and intact ventriculoatrial conduction. If there is a persistent pattern, a bigeminal rhythm is seen in which every paced beat is followed by a normal QRS complex.</p><p>If echo beats are able to continue conduction up or down two pathways, a re-entrant rhythm and supraventricular tachycardia occurs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-narrow-qrs-complex-tachycardias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of narrow QRS complex tachycardias&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">ATRIOVENTRICULAR DISSOCIATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrioventricular (AV) dissociation is present when there is independent activation of the atrium and ventricle as a result of absent conduction through the AV node (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52123\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef52123 \">waveform 16</a>). There is no fixed relationship between the P waves and the QRS complexes, and the PR intervals are variable in a random fashion. There are several causes of AV dissociation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slowing of the sinus node rate with the development of an escape junctional or ventricular rhythm, which does not result in retrograde conduction through the AV node or atrial activation, may result in AV dissociation. The sinus node is not depressed or overdriven. Usually, the junctional or ventricular rate is faster than the sinus rate; thus, the interval between the QRS complexes is shorter than the PP interval. There may be isorhythmic dissociation if the sinus rate and rate of the junctional or ventricular rhythm are similar; in these cases, there is a slightly variable and usually very short PR interval, and occasionally the P wave merges with and is buried within the QRS complex and therefore not seen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Block of sinus impulses within the atrium or in the AV node (third degree heart block) may cause AV dissociation. There is an escape junctional or ventricular rhythm at a rate that is slower than the sinus node. Thus, the PP interval is shorter than the RR interval.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acceleration or enhanced automaticity of lower or subsidiary pacemakers, such as occurs with an accelerated junctional or ventricular rhythm or with a ventricular tachycardia, and rarely with a junctional tachycardia, may cause AV dissociation. There is a retrograde block of impulse conduction through the AV node (no ventriculoatrial conduction); thus, there is no atrial activation and the sinus node is not suppressed. The RR interval is shorter than the PP interval.</p><p/><p>Fusion beats or capture beats may be seen when the AV dissociation results from the acceleration of a lower subsidiary focus or pacemaker, which usurps the pacemaker function from the sinus node. These complexes represent intermittent AV conduction and activation of the ventricle by a sinus beat conducted antegradely through the AV node. Fusion beats are absent when there is structural block of the AV node and no AV conduction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">RETROGRADE ATRIAL ACTIVATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retrograde atrial activation occurs when there is ventriculoatrial conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node. The dominant rhythm originates in the AV junction (junctional tachycardia) or in the ventricles (ventricular tachycardia). There is a negative P wave following the QRS complex as a result of atrial activation in an inferior to superior direction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51600\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef51600 \">waveform 17</a>). The RP interval between the QRS and the P wave is determined by the retrograde ventriculoatrial conduction time and is most commonly short. This interval is usually constant; however, there may be retrograde Wenckebach or Mobitz I retrograde block that manifests as a progressive lengthening of the RP interval with subsequent block of impulse conduction to the atrium, or Mobitz type 2 block (eg, 2:1 block), where the RP interval is fixed before dropping.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16447884\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p>Early repolarization is present when there is J-point elevation of &ge;0.1 mV in two adjacent leads with either a slurred or notched morphology.
