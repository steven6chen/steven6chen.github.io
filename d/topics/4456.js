In Latin, the word &quot;tortus&quot; means &quot;twisted,&quot; and &quot;collum&quot; means &quot;neck.&quot; Torticollis, also called wryneck, is a common complaint in children and may be congenital or acquired.</p><p>The management and prognosis of congenital muscular torticollis will be reviewed here. The clinical features and diagnosis of congenital muscular torticollis, acquired torticollis in children, and neck stiffness in children are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H22047630\" class=\"local\">'Response to therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Parents should be educated about the expected course of congenital muscular torticollis. Given that they are responsible for performing the home exercise program, it is crucial that they understand factors that contribute to asymmetry (eg, lack of prone positioning, excessive time in car seats or infant carriers, not alternating sides when feeding the infant or placing the infant to sleep) and know how to safely and effectively provide the interventions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22046141\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR REFERRAL</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27120054\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decisions regarding referral to a physical therapist and the timing of referral are individualized according to the age of onset and severity of congenital muscular torticollis, the ability of the caregivers to perform passive stretching correctly, and the availability of a physical therapist who is experienced in treating congenital muscular torticollis. The physical therapist can instruct the caregivers to perform the stretching exercises safely and effectively <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> provide ongoing physical therapy and assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-muscular-torticollis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>We refer infants to outpatient physical therapy if the home regimen is not successful after four to six weeks.

In a randomized pilot study in 20 infants with congenital muscular torticollis, symmetric head posture was achieved earlier when stretching exercises were performed by an experienced physical therapist than by parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-muscular-torticollis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

These interventions make up the home exercise program, which can be implemented and monitored by the primary care provider or the physical therapist.</p><p>The first-line interventions are supported by observational studies and consensus guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-muscular-torticollis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1,2,4,5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4,5,10</a>]. In a case series of 1086 infants who initiated treatment before 12 months of age, &gt;90 percent of infants who were treated with these interventions at home or received manual stretching performed by a trained physical therapist had progressive improvement in head tilt and range of motion and did not require surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-muscular-torticollis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22046716\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning and handling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants with congenital muscular torticollis can be positioned and held to facilitate passive range of motion of the neck and strengthening of the neck muscles. Positioning and handling interventions may be used to prevent or treat congenital muscular torticollis and deformational plagiocephaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-muscular-torticollis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Caregivers should be instructed to hold the infant so that he or she rotates the chin toward the shoulder of the affected side during feeding. For example, for the child with <span class=\"nowrap\">head/ear</span> tilted to the right and chin rotated to the left (ie, torticollis involving the right sternocleidomastoid [SCM]), cradle the child in the left arm so the head is tilted to the left and the chin is rotated to the right while drinking a bottle.</p><p>Caregivers should also be instructed about the importance of prone positioning (&quot;tummy time&quot;) when the infant is awake and being watched by an adult. Prone positioning with the head up stretches the SCM and strengthens the neck muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-muscular-torticollis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>]. In an observational study in infants with congenital muscular torticollis, prone positioning at least three times per day was associated with higher scores on the Alberta Infant Motor Scale at two and six months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-muscular-torticollis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In observational studies and a small randomized trial, positioning interventions were associated with improved development of active and passive neck motion, symmetric head shape, achievement of motor milestones, and tolerance of prone positioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-muscular-torticollis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/3,13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13-17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22046884\"><span class=\"h2\">Environmental adaptations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The home environment can be adapted to encourage the infant to turn the head in the direction that stretches the SCM. Environmental adaptations are part of the home exercise program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-muscular-torticollis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Placing the infant in the crib or on the changing table so that he or she must rotate the chin toward the shoulder of the affected side to view the room. For example, for the infant with torticollis with <span class=\"nowrap\">head/ear</span> tilt to the left and chin rotation to the right, place the infant in the crib supine with his or her right side closest to the wall. The infant must then rotate the chin to the left to view the room.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, place toys or a mobile on the right side of a supine infant with torticollis with <span class=\"nowrap\">head/ear</span> tilt to the right and chin rotated to the left. To view the objects in the right upper visual field, the infant must tilt his head toward the unaffected side (thus improving the head tilt component) and rotate the chin to the affected side (improving the chin rotation component).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22046904\"><span class=\"h2\">Passive stretching</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Passive stretching is performed to elongate the shortened SCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-muscular-torticollis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/5,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,18,19</a>]. However, there is no consensus regarding the technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-muscular-torticollis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The intensity of stretching exercises (ie, number of repetitions, duration of stretches, frequency of sessions) varies from study to study, and the optimal intensity has not been determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-muscular-torticollis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, observational studies suggest that greater intensity regimens are associated with more rapid resolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-muscular-torticollis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. Greater intensity regimens generally are suggested for children with more severe forms of congenital muscular torticollis, later initiation of therapy (eg, after 3 months of age), and those with associated asymmetries (eg, deformational plagiocephaly, facial asymmetry).</p><p>Passive stretching exercises are easier to perform in infants younger than two months &ndash; before the neck muscles are strengthened; infants younger than two months can also be distracted more easily than older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-muscular-torticollis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/5,7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,13</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Contraindications</strong> &ndash; Cervical spine abnormalities are the primary contraindication to stretching exercises. Anterior-posterior and lateral radiographs of the cervical spine may be warranted before the exercises are recommended.

Parents may be encouraged to identify a regular time to perform the exercises, such as every time they change a diaper.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To address the rotational component of the torticollis &ndash; With the infant in the supine or sitting position, the caregiver should place one hand on the shoulder of the unaffected side (ie, the side toward which the chin is rotated). The other hand should gently rotate the infant's chin so that the chin touches the tip of the shoulder of the affected side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82643\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82643 \">figure 2</a>). For example, for the child with torticollis with the <span class=\"nowrap\">head/ear</span> tilted to the right and chin rotated to the left, stabilize the left shoulder and rotate the chin toward the right.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To address the head tilt component of the torticollis &ndash; With the infant in the supine or sitting position, the caregiver should place one hand on the shoulder of the affected side (ie, the side to which the head is tilted). The other hand should tilt the head away from the side of the shortened muscle until the child's ear touches the shoulder of the unaffected side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51879\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51879 \">figure 3</a>). For example, for the child with torticollis with <span class=\"nowrap\">head/ear</span> tilted to the right, stabilize the right shoulder and tilt the head and ear to the left shoulder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">For the exercises to be effective, the infant must be relaxed and providing no resistance; the exercise should be stopped if the infant resists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-muscular-torticollis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/15,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Infants who are initially referred to a physical therapist for instruction and ongoing care should follow the stretching regimen provided by the physical therapist.

Snapping (partial or complete rupture) of the SCM may occur. In a prospective study of 455 infants with congenital muscular torticollis who were treated with a manual stretching program, snapping occurred in 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-muscular-torticollis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The group with snapping had a more severe SCM tumor, higher incidence of hip dysplasia, earlier clinical presentation, and shorter duration of treatment than the group without snapping.

(See <a href=\"#H100947544\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of treatment include achievement of midline head position, symmetric posture and gross motor skills, <span class=\"nowrap\">prevention/improvement</span> of craniofacial asymmetry, and resolution of restricted cervical range of motion. Earlier initiation of treatment is associated with increased effectiveness and shorter duration of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H22045995\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decisions regarding referral to a physical therapist and the timing of referral are individualized according to the age of onset and severity of congenital muscular torticollis, the ability of the caregivers to perform passive stretching correctly, and the availability of a physical therapist who is experienced in treating congenital muscular torticollis. (See <a href=\"#H27120054\" class=\"local\">'Physical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for referral to other specialists include deformational plagiocephaly <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> craniofacial asymmetry, developmental dysplasia of the hip, cervical spine abnormalities, abnormalities on eye examination (eg, limited extraocular movements nystagmus), and abnormalities on neurologic examination. (See <a href=\"#H27120061\" class=\"local\">'Other specialists'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first-line interventions for congenital muscular torticollis include a combination of positioning and handling changes, environmental adaptations, and physical therapy interventions to facilitate passive range of motion of the neck, active range of motion of the neck and trunk, and development of symmetric posture, function, and movement.
