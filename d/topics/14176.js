The amount of dialysis that a patient receives and the amount of uremic toxin removal can impact morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Uremic toxins include small, water-soluble compounds such as urea, protein-bound solutes such as indoles and phenols, or larger middle molecules such as beta2-microglobulin. Assessment of solute removal during dialysis has always been based on urea removal. However, evidence from experimental and clinical studies points to an adverse effect of middle molecules and protein-bound solutes on patient survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Two central issues in the management of patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis include determining the optimal amount of dialysis that should be prescribed and quantifying the amount of dialysis that is actually delivered to individual patients.</p><p>Improvement in patients' symptoms and the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration are not accurate measures of dialysis adequacy for two reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dialysis dose that reduces uremic symptoms is lower than the dose shown to increase survival. This is especially true when erythropoietin is started concurrently with dialysis for anemia since many symptoms attributed to uremia are actually related to anemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-anemia-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of anemia in nondialysis chronic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyporesponse-to-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyporesponse to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The BUN depends on factors that are independent of the dialysis dose, such as protein intake, protein catabolic rate, and residual renal function. A low BUN may reflect inadequate nutrition rather than sufficient dialytic urea removal.</p><p/><p>All methods used to measure dialysis dose are based upon urea clearance. Although the best method is not known, the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> is used by most nephrologists. This topic reviews the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> and other methods that are used to measure the amount of dialysis delivered to individual patients. We also discuss dialysis dose recommendations for hemodialysis patients. Assessing the adequacy of peritoneal dialysis is discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-solute-clearance-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis-kt-v-and-creatinine-clearance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of solute clearance in continuous peritoneal dialysis: Kt/V and creatinine clearance&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inadequate-solute-clearance-in-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inadequate solute clearance in peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>). Patient outcomes related to dialysis are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival and maintenance dialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis modality and patient outcome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">Kt/V</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11150541\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition and calculation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> is the preferred method for measuring the dialysis dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> is defined as the dialyzer clearance of urea (<strong>K</strong>) multiplied by the duration of the dialysis treatment (<strong>t</strong>, in minutes) divided by the volume of distribution of urea in the body (<strong>V</strong>, in mL), which is approximately equal to the total body water, corrected for volume lost during ultrafiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The correction of total urea removal (Kt) for volume of distribution is important since the rate of urea removal depends on the total body burden of urea; in a large patient, a given degree of urea loss represents a lower rate of removal of the total body burden of urea (and presumably of other small uremic toxins).</p><p>Equation 1 shows the calculation for <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span>. This formula and the accompanying nomogram have little systematic error for <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> values between 0.7 and 2.0, a range that covers the currently recommended <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> goals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F64426\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64426 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]:</p><p>(Eq. 1) &#160; <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> &#160; = &#160; -ln (R &#160;- &#160;0.03) &#160;+ &#160;[(4 &#160;- &#160;3.5R) &#160;x &#160;(UF &#160;&divide; &#160;W)] [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]</p><p>where UF is the ultrafiltration volume in liters, W is the postdialysis weight in kg, and R is the ratio of the postdialysis to predialysis blood urea nitrogen (BUN). A calculator capable of performing natural logarithms is generally used to determine the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span>.</p><p>The timing and method of obtaining the postdialysis BUN affect the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span>. This is because the concentration of urea in blood samples drawn from the arterial access (ie, where blood leaves the patient and enters the dialyzer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59794\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59794 \">figure 2</a>)) increases for approximately 30 minutes after dialysis ends. The increase in BUN is caused by the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissipation of hemodialysis access recirculation and cardiopulmonary recirculation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Equilibration of urea from the extravascular compartment to the vascular compartment</p><p/><p>Hemodialysis access recirculation occurs when dialyzed blood returning through the venous needle re-enters the extracorporeal circuit through the arterial needle, rather than returning to the systemic circulation. Significant hemodialysis access recirculation is abnormal and is usually due to venous stenosis, which obstructs venous outflow, resulting in increased pressure and backflow into the arterial needle (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arteriovenous-fistula-recirculation-in-hemodialysis#H237248303\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arteriovenous fistula recirculation in hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Definition and mechanism'</a>). Cardiopulmonary recirculation is a result of dialyzed blood being sent directly to the heart and lungs from the dialyzer and returning to the arterial needle after bypassing the systemic circulation. The degree to which cardiopulmonary bypass occurs depends on the rate of blood flow in the dialyzer and the cardiac output. Cardiopulmonary bypass is most severe among patients with low cardiac output who are undergoing high-efficiency dialysis. The result of both hemodialysis access recirculation and cardiopulmonary recirculation is that the BUN sampled from arterial blood flowing into the dialyzer tends to be lower than from venous blood. Both hemodialysis access recirculation and cardiopulmonary recirculation dissipate within minutes after stopping dialysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F57290\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57290 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The equilibration of urea from the extravascular compartment into the vascular space can take up to 30 minutes after dialysis ends.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">To achieve the most accurate measure of the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> (referred to as the equilibrated or double-pool <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V),</span> it is necessary to use an equilibrated BUN measured from a sample obtained 30 minutes after dialysis has ended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. However, the 30-minute equilibrated BUN is difficult to perform in the outpatient clinical setting since most patients do not wish to add additional waiting time to the overall dialysis time.</p><p/><p>To circumvent this inconvenience for patients, we and most other clinicians use a nonequilibrated BUN. We slow the blood pump to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> for 15 seconds and then stop the pump before the blood sample for BUN is obtained. Slowing blood flow to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> reduces the entry of cleared (ie, dialyzed) blood into the access and stops cardiopulmonary and hemodialysis access recirculation. This procedure is consistent with the 2006 National Kidney Foundation Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) and the European and Canadian hemodialysis guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/5,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13,14</a>]. The <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> calculated from this sample is called the nonequilibrated or single-pool <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span>.</p><p>The equilibrated, double-pool <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> is lower than the nonequilibrated, single-pool <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> since the urea concentration measured with the equilibrated sample is higher than that observed in the nonequilibrated sample. This difference is approximately 0.21 for the usual range of delivered doses of hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and decreases with longer hemodialysis treatment times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/10,11,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,15,16</a>].</p><p>However, between individual patients, there may be variability in the required time for complete equilibration. As an example, some patients have diminished blood flow to specific tissue beds (ie, in the setting of low cardiac function or peripheral vascular disease, for example), which causes delayed equilibration. This variability is difficult to predict [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Incorrect sampling of postdialysis BUN is common and may cause erroneous conclusions concerning the correlation between patient outcomes and the presumed delivery of a specific amount of dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>At the very least, it is important that, within facilities, the same procedure is consistently followed in order to ensure, as much as possible, reliable estimates of the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span>.</p><p>Unless otherwise stated, the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> referred to in this topic review is the nonequilibrated, single-pool value.</p><p>The formula for the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> in the following calculator also takes the length of the dialysis session into consideration (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-kt-v-dialysis-dose-daugirdas-formula\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176663897\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> helped to improve dialysis efficiency and to standardize the dialysis procedure.

Limitations to the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> was developed in an era when dialysis utilized small-pore cellulosic dialyzers. Dialysis is now more commonly performed with large-pore high-flux dialysis membranes, which remove molecules with proven biological impact and may result in better outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of the toxicity of urea is limited, and its impact on patients' outcomes has not been documented. Moreover, urea clearance determined by any method may not represent the kinetic behavior of other potentially toxic molecules (other small solutes, middle molecules, protein-bound solutes, phosphate, etc). As an example, the volume of distribution of urea is much smaller than similarly small-molecular-weight solutes such as the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guanidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">guanidine</a> compounds, which have a well-documented toxic effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> measures urea clearance in a single session, with the implicit assumption that the session is representative of all other sessions. Thus, the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> does not account for missed treatments or shortened dialysis that may occur during other sessions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As noted above, errors in timing of postdialysis BUN determination may affect <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> determination because of variability in equilibration of urea in individual patients.

High-flux membranes provide higher clearance of larger solutes, removal of which might improve cardiovascular outcomes. Indeed, a meta-analysis of the above three trials showed that the use of high-flux dialyzers was associated with a decrease in cardiovascular mortality compared with low-flux membranes (hazard ratio [HR] 0.82, 95% CI 0.70-0.96) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

As an example, given that larger-sized patients have a lower mortality, the relatively increased number of smaller-size patients increased the power of the HEMO study. In addition, the finding of a high degree of correlation between mortality and dialysis dose in the as-treated analysis is unlikely to represent an effect of dose on mortality but rather a bias underlying the effect of mortality on the achieved <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>A potential explanation for the lack of impact of increasing <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> on patients' outcomes was provided by a post-hoc analysis of the data and samples of the HEMO study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

Increasing <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> by approximately 30 percent reduced predialysis serum concentrations of these solutes by &lt;10 percent and even smaller for other small solutes, indicating that <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> is not a good metric for the effects of changes in dialysis prescriptions on serum concentrations of individual solutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H171808900\"><span class=\"h2\">Minimum dialysis frequency and time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At our institution, we routinely prescribe dialysis treatment times of at least four hours per session for a minimum of three sessions per week for our patients, irrespective of their <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span>.

As an example, in the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS), compared with shorter sessions, session length greater than four hours was associated with a lower risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, as well as lower risk of sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Patients dialyzed for more than four hours per session also had lower pre- and postdialysis systolic blood pressure, greater intradialytic weight loss, higher hemoglobin and serum albumin, and lower serum phosphorus and white blood cell counts, all of which may have contributed to better survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>One study examined the effects of longer hemodialysis treatment time on clinical outcomes, independent of any increase in dialysis frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The study compared all-cause mortality of 1206 patients who received nocturnal, in-center, extended-hours hemodialysis for at least 60 days with 111,707 patients who received conventional hemodialysis. The average treatment times in the extended-hours hemodialysis sessions were 6.7 hours compared with 3.5 hours for conventional hemodialysis sessions, both administered thrice weekly. Patients were followed up for up to five years. In the primary analysis, patients treated with extended-hours hemodialysis had a 33 percent lower adjusted risk of death compared with those who were treated with conventional hemodialysis (95% CI 7-51 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Longer dialysis time is resisted by many patients. However, longer sessions are generally better tolerated as shorter sessions more commonly precipitate muscle cramps, fatigue, and intradialytic hypotension as more fluid is removed in a shorter period of time. The 2015 National Kidney Foundation&rsquo;s KDOQI clinical practice guideline recommends that patients with little or no residual kidney function (ie, &lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> who are undergoing three-times-weekly dialysis undergo a minimum dialysis time of three hours per session [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>The impacts of dialysis time and frequency of dialysis sessions were examined in two trials by the Frequent Hemodialysis Network (FHN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. The first trial compared conventional hemodialysis performed thrice weekly at home with frequent home nocturnal hemodialysis performed six times weekly for at least six hours per session [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

Surprisingly, long-term follow-up of patients enrolled in the FHN nocturnal trial found an increased risk for death in the nocturnal hemodialysis group that could be related to the unexpectedly low mortality rate observed in the conventional dialysis group, the loss of residual kidney function, and the high rates of dialysis modality switches in this study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>The second trial by the FHN compared the effects on patients' outcomes of hemodialysis six times per week with conventional (three times per week) in-center hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. The trial showed that frequent hemodialysis resulted in better control of hypertension and serum phosphate. Moreover, frequent hemodialysis was associated with favorable changes in the co-primary composite outcomes of death or change (from baseline to 12 months) in left ventricular mass, as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and death or change in the physical health composite score of the RAND 36-item health survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Some patients have large interdialytic fluid gain in between dialysis sessions, resulting in a large ultrafiltration requirement per session. Large interdialytic fluid gain may result in failure to achieve the optimal dry weight since it is difficult to remove sufficient fluid in four hours due to hemodynamic instability or the development of muscle cramping. As an example, a retrospective analysis of 15,536 patients from seven countries participating in DOPPS showed that an ultrafiltration rate &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour/kg</span> was associated with significantly increased risk of intradialytic hypotension and all-cause mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In another prospective study, each 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour/kg</span> increase in the ultrafiltration rate was associated with a 22 percent increase in mortality risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. A more recent, large, observational study including 118,394 hemodialysis patients dialyzing in a large dialysis organization from 2008 to 2012 demonstrated an incrementally greater harm and mortality associated with greater ultrafiltration rates &#160;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. This study suggests that ultrafiltration-related harm may be observed at ultrafiltration rates lower than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour/kg,</span> which is substantially lower than the proposed quality measure threshold of 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour/kg</span>. Moreover, regardless of the threshold implemented, higher ultrafiltration rate was associated with greater mortality across key subgroups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with large interdialytic weight gain, the dialysis time per session should be increased or more frequent dialysis should be considered to allow a lower ultrafiltration rate.

The individual dialysis prescription may be revised depending upon this assessment. Persistent hyponatremia suggests volume overload, which may be addressed by adjusting the ultrafiltration as described above. Persistent hyperkalemia usually reflects dietary noncompliance but may occasionally require adding an additional dialysis session per week. However, persistent hyperkalemia may also reflect inadequate dialysis due to access recirculation, which will be reflected in the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span>.

In such patients, the urea clearance of the blood delivered to the dialyzer is already at near maximal levels. As a result, increasing dialyzer size, blood flow, or dialysate flow will produce only a marginal improvement. The only way to compensate for the reduced efficiency of urea removal is to increase the time on dialysis.

Two central issues in the management of patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis include determining the optimal amount of dialysis that should be prescribed and assessing the amount of delivered dialysis for individual patients. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preferred method of measuring delivered dialysis is the equilibrated or single-pool <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V,</span> which is defined as the dialyzer clearance of urea (<strong>K</strong>, obtained from the manufacturer in <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> and periodically measured and verified by the dialysis team), multiplied by the duration of the dialysis treatment (<strong>t</strong>, in minutes), divided by the volume of distribution of urea in the body (<strong>V</strong>, in mL), which is approximately equal to the total body water. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Kt/V'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> has many limitations. In addition to technical difficulties related to timing of measurement of urea, limitations include an overestimate of delivered dialysis among patients who are small sized or malnourished; the assumption that urea clearance reflects other small solutes' clearances, which may not be correct; and the assumption that the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> measured in a single session reflects delivered dialysis in all other sessions for individual patients. In addition, the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> does not account for a possible independent effect of dialysis-session length or total body water on patient outcomes, nor does it factor in other patient-related variables such as volume control, hemodynamic instability, clinical symptoms, and changes in biochemical parameters, which have been associated with patient outcome. (See <a href=\"#H176663897\" class=\"local\">'Limitations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no universally accepted target value for the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span>. We use <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> as a marker of minimal dialysis adequacy. We suggest a minimum <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> &ge;1.2, rather than lower values (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Some studies suggest that <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> &ge;1.2 is associated with decreased mortality (see <a href=\"#H794160589\" class=\"local\">'The optimal amount of dialysis'</a> above). In order to achieve the suggested minimum <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V,</span> we target a single-pool <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of 1.4, which is consistent with the 2006 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines. (See <a href=\"#H794161203\" class=\"local\">'Target Kt/V'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Even if the minimum <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> is achieved with shorter times, we suggest a minimum dialysis session time of at least four hours, rather than a shorter time (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Dialysis session times less than four hours have been associated with increased mortality and morbidity. (See <a href=\"#H171808900\" class=\"local\">'Minimum dialysis frequency and time'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dialysis prescription may be modified for individual patients in order to provide optimal fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance; to maintain hemodynamic stability during dialysis; and to address disorders of mineral metabolism. Clinical outcomes should be monitored, including rehabilitation and quality of life. Trends of morbidity and mortality rates in individual dialysis facilities should be followed over time. (See <a href=\"#H171808789\" class=\"local\">'Patient-specific parameters'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An assessment of the dialysis dose in stable hemodialysis patients is performed once per month by most clinicians. Patients who have a <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> that is below target should be carefully assessed for fistula integrity and adequate treatment duration as prescribed. (See <a href=\"#H794160595\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14175159\" class=\"local\">'Causes of inadequate dialysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176664125\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The authors and UpToDate would like to acknowledge Dr. Robert E Cronin, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lowrie EG, Laird NM, Parker TF, Sargent JA.
