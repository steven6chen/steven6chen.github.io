It can also make you feel full too soon after you start eating. It happens because the stomach takes too long to empty and does not move food along through your body fast enough (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66110 \">figure 1</a>). Gastroparesis is also called &quot;delayed gastric emptying.&quot; (&quot;Gastric&quot; means &quot;having to do with the stomach.&quot;)</p><p>Gastroparesis is a common problem among people with diabetes. It also can happen to people who have had food poisoning (gastroenteritis). But it can sometimes happen to people who have not been sick and who do not have diabetes.</p><p>When gastroparesis starts after someone has had food poisoning, it often gets better in a few days to weeks. Sometimes it lasts longer or never goes away. In people with diabetes, it usually does not go away, but there are things that can make it better.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2420082\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of gastroparesis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea with or without vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling full too soon after you start eating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloating (feeling as though your stomach is full of air)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2420089\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for gastroparesis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse suspects you have gastroparesis, he or she might do 1 or more of these tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endoscopy</strong> &ndash; A doctor or nurse puts a thin tube down your throat and into your stomach. The tube (called an endoscope) has a light and a tiny camera on the end, so it allows the doctor or nurse to see inside your stomach. If he or she still finds food in your stomach even though it has been more than 8 hours since you ate, that is a sign that you might have gastroparesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Barium</a><strong> follow through, CT scan, or MRI</strong> &ndash; For these tests you eat a special substance that shows up on imaging. This can show if there is something blocking the flow of food, keeping it from leaving your stomach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastric emptying scintigraphy</strong> &ndash; For this test you eat food that has a small amount of a radioactive material in it. Then you have images taken of the inside of your body for up to 4 hours. That way, doctors can follow where the food goes and how fast it gets there. If you still have a fair amount of food in your stomach after 4 hours, that means you have gastroparesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Breath test</strong> &ndash; This is a newer test that measures substances in your breath after you have eaten a special meal. The measurements can sometimes show if you have gastroparesis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2420096\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I change my diet to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Some people feel better if they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat 4 to 5 small meals during the day instead of 2 or 3 big ones.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put food through the blender before eating it.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cut down on foods that have a lot of fat, such as cheese and fried foods.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cut down on foods that have a lot of &quot;insoluble&quot; fiber, such as some fruits, vegetables, and beans.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid fizzy drinks, like soda, as they can cause more bloating and gas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid alcohol and smoking</p><p/><p>If you have diabetes, it's also very important to keep your blood sugar as close to normal as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2420103\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if you have ongoing nausea or vomiting, belly pain, trouble eating, or weight loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2420110\"><span class=\"h1\">How is gastroparesis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatments to help you get the food and fluids you need &ndash; This might include taking liquid food supplements or &ndash; in rare cases &ndash; being fed through a tube.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that make the stomach empty faster</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that help prevent nausea</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emptying the stomach with a tube &ndash; To do this, doctors can put a tube down your throat or directly into your stomach through your skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrical stimulation of the stomach &ndash; In very rare cases, doctors use electrical stimulation to make the stomach empty.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2420207\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Upper endoscopy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Upper endoscopy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
