ALS is also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous New York Yankee baseball player who was affected with the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>ALS has an annual incidence of one to three cases per 100,000 people that is believed to be the same worldwide. There appears to be no ethnic or racial predisposition to ALS. Prior to the age of 65 or 70, the incidence of ALS is higher in men than in women, but thereafter the gender incidence is equal. ALS has an age distribution that peaks in the seventh to eighth decades. However, ALS can occur in people in their twenties. ALS is most commonly sporadic. Genetic or familial ALS represents only 10 percent of all ALS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the clinical features of ALS. The epidemiology, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of ALS are discussed separately.

Such inclusions also occur in nonmotor frontal and temporal cortical neurons and in more widespread areas of the brain not typically associated with classic ALS. Inclusions stain positively for ubiquitin; a large subset also stain positively for TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) and smaller subsets stain for fused in sarcoma (FUS) protein and optineurin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&quot;, section on 'Intracellular inclusions'</a>.)</p><p>The term &quot;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&quot; is derived from the combination of the clinical examination finding of amyotrophy with the pathological finding of lateral sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. While it was once presumed to be a pure motor disorder, it has become increasingly apparent that degeneration of other brain regions such as frontal and temporal cortical neurons may also occur as part of the clinicopathologic spectrum of ALS. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'ALS-plus syndrome'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive symptoms'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Autonomic symptoms'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Parkinsonism and supranuclear gaze palsy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Sensory symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECTRUM OF MOTOR NEURON DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of multiple degenerative motor neuron diseases that are clinically defined, based on the involvement of upper <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lower motor neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/1,2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8</a>]. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the most common form of motor neuron disease and includes upper and lower motor neuron pathology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Progressive muscular atrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progressive muscular atrophy is a progressive lower motor neuron disorder. Some experts believe it represents a form of ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>When the disease remains confined to the lower motor neuron, survival may be prolonged compared with classic ALS. In the largest study, 91 patients initially diagnosed with progressive muscular atrophy had a longer median survival than 871 patients with ALS (48 versus 36 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, on Kaplan-Meier estimates, the survival curves of progressive muscular atrophy and ALS crossed at approximately 80 months. Thereafter, the estimated survival in progressive muscular atrophy was about the same as that of ALS. In an earlier series, 37 patients with progressive muscular atrophy had a median survival of 56 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Some individuals with progressive muscular atrophy never develop clinical upper motor neuron signs. Many, however, develop upper motor neuron signs later in their clinical course, at which point the disease is called lower motor neuron-onset ALS. In the series cited above, upper motor neuron signs developed in 20 of 91 patients (22 percent) initially diagnosed with progressive muscular atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Typically, upper motor neuron involvement occurred within two years of symptom onset.</p><p>At autopsy, patients with progressive muscular atrophy who never developed clinically apparent upper motor neuron signs frequently have upper motor neuron pathology, including corticospinal tract abnormalities and TDP-43 positive inclusions in motor cortex, in a pattern identical to that of ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary lateral sclerosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary lateral sclerosis is a progressive isolated upper motor neuron disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Compared with ALS, it is characterized by slower progression, lack of weight loss, and absence of lower motor neuron findings on examination or electromyography in the first four years after symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In large series and population-based studies of patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">ALS/motor</span> neuron disease, only a small percentage has pure upper motor neuron disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Some individuals with primary lateral sclerosis never develop clinical lower motor neuron signs. Most, however, do develop lower motor neuron signs later in their clinical course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This is referred to as upper motor neuron-onset ALS. Reports of pathology in clinically defined primary lateral sclerosis are limited, but disease pathologically isolated to the upper motor neuron has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective study of 39 patients who were initially diagnosed with primary lateral sclerosis, pure upper motor neuron signs were present on initial evaluation in 29 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Over a mean 8.7 years of follow-up, pure upper motor neuron signs were retained in 16 patients who were classified as clinically pure primary lateral sclerosis, while electromyographic or clinical evidence of denervation and lower motor neuron disease developed in 13 patients who were classified as upper motor neuron-dominant ALS. The lower motor neuron findings developed by four years in 10 (77 percent) of the 13 patients with upper motor neuron-dominant ALS.</p><p>In another retrospective series involving 661 patients with ALS and 43 with primary lateral sclerosis, spasticity at clinical presentation and absence of limb muscle wasting for at least three years were significantly more common in patients with primary lateral sclerosis than those with ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Pure primary lateral sclerosis and upper motor neuron-dominant ALS appear to have a more benign prognosis than typical ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/13,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,22</a>]. Survival was longer and disease progression slower in patients classified as primary lateral sclerosis compared with ALS controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Survival for patients with upper motor neuron-dominant ALS was intermediate between that of primary lateral sclerosis and classic ALS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Progressive bulbar palsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progressive bulbar palsy is a progressive upper and lower motor neuron disorder of cranial muscles. This condition may occasionally stay isolated to the bulbar segment, but more commonly, upper and lower motor neuron signs and symptoms spread to involve other segments. This is then referred to as bulbar-onset ALS. There have been no reports of specific pathology in progressive bulbar palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/1-3,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Flail arm syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The flail arm syndrome (also called brachial amyotrophic diplegia) is characterized by progressive lower motor neuron weakness and wasting that predominantly affects the proximal arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. It usually begins proximally and spreads distally to the point where arm and hand function is severely impaired. It is often asymmetric. Patients presenting with the flail arm variant of ALS have a slower rate of progression both to the spread of signs and symptoms in other body segments and to development of respiratory muscle weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28382562\"><span class=\"h2\">Flail leg syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The flail leg syndrome (also called the pseudopolyneuritic variant of <span class=\"nowrap\">ALS/motor</span> neuron disease) is characterized by progressive lower motor neuron weakness and wasting with onset in the distal leg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].

However, some patients have all of the clinical features of ALS along with features of other disorders such as frontotemporal dementia, autonomic insufficiency, parkinsonism, supranuclear gaze paresis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sensory loss. Such patients are considered to have ALS-plus syndrome. In a case report, a patient with clinically definite ALS accompanied by a supranuclear gaze disorder and an extrapyramidal syndrome reminiscent of progressive supranuclear palsy demonstrated diffuse TDP-43 pathology at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The loss of motor neurons results in the primary clinical symptoms and signs of ALS. These may produce impairment affecting limb (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F72454\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72454 \">table 1</a>), bulbar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75146\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75146 \">table 2</a>), axial (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F67913\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67913 \">table 3</a>) and respiratory (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F58537\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58537 \">table 4</a>) function.</p><p>Differences in site and segment (cranial, cervical, thoracic, or lumbosacral) of onset, pattern and speed of spread, and the degree of upper <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lower motor neuron dysfunction produce a disorder that is remarkably variable between individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial clinical manifestation of ALS may occur in any body segment (bulbar, cervical, thoracic or lumbosacral) and may manifest as upper motor neuron (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Upper motor neuron symptoms'</a> below) or lower motor neuron (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Lower motor neuron symptoms'</a> below) symptoms or signs. Asymmetric limb weakness is the most common presentation of ALS (80 percent). Upper extremity onset is most often heralded by hand weakness but may begin in the shoulder girdle muscles. The &ldquo;split-hand syndrome&rdquo; describes a frequent pattern of weakness and atrophy in ALS that predominantly involves the median- and ulnar-innervated lateral (thenar) hand intrinsic muscles with relative sparing of the medial (hypothenar) muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Lower extremity onset of ALS most often begins with weakness of foot dorsiflexion (foot drop), while proximal pelvic girdle onset is less common. </p><p>Twenty percent of patients will have onset in the bulbar segment, which most often presents with either dysarthria or dysphagia.</p><p>Less common patterns of ALS onset include respiratory muscle weakness (1 to 3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], generalized weakness in the limbs and bulbar muscles (1 to 9 percent), axial onset with head drop or truncal extension weakness, and weight loss with muscle atrophy, fasciculations, and cramps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Upper motor neuron symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loss of upper motor neurons (UMNs) results in slowness of movement, incoordination and stiffness with relatively little overt weakness. Arm or hand UMN symptoms include poor dexterity with resulting difficulty performing activities of daily living. Leg UMN symptoms manifest as a spastic gait with poor balance and may include spontaneous leg flexor spasms and ankle clonus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F72454\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72454 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Dysarthria and dysphagia are the most common bulbar UMN symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75146\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75146 \">table 2</a>). UMN or spastic dysarthria produces a characteristically strained vocal quality with slow speech. UMN dysphagia results from slow and discoordinated contraction of the swallowing muscles, which may lead to coughing and choking.</p><p>Another frequent bulbar UMN symptom is the syndrome of the pseudobulbar affect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. This is manifested as inappropriate laughing, crying, or yawning. This may occur as an early manifestation of ALS or may develop during the disease course. The observed affect is often mood incongruent or may be triggered by stimuli that would not have elicited such a response prior to the development of pseudobulbar affect. Patients also report difficulty with cessation of the laughing or crying once it has begun. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Symptom-based management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&quot;, section on 'Pseudobulbar affect'</a>.)</p><p>UMN bulbar dysfunction may also result in laryngospasm. This is a short-lived (usually &lt;30 seconds) reflex closure of the larynx that most often occurs in response to aspiration of food particles or liquids, including saliva. The patient typically describes a squeezing feeling in the throat accompanied by impaired inspiration and difficulty speaking; there may be audible stridor.</p><p>Additional manifestations of UMN bulbar dysfunction may include increased masseter tone and difficulty opening the mouth. When severe, this is referred to as trismus. At times there may be involuntary jaw clenching with biting of the sides of the tongue and cheeks.</p><p>Axial UMN dysfunction may contribute to stiffness and imbalance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F67913\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67913 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Lower motor neuron symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loss of LMNs results in weakness, usually accompanied by atrophy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53274\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef53274 \">movie 1</a>) and fasciculations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66062\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef66062 \">movie 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F63510\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef63510 \">movie 3</a>). Muscle cramps are also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Hand weakness causes difficulty manipulating small objects (buttons, zippers, coins) and using writing instruments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F72454\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72454 \">table 1</a>). Proximal arm weakness results in difficulty elevating the arm to the level of the mouth or above the head. This can produce difficulty with bathing, dressing, grooming and eating. Foot and ankle weakness results in tripping, a slapping gait, and falling. Proximal leg weakness results in difficulty arising from chairs, climbing stairs and getting off of the floor. Balance may also be adversely affected.</p><p>Dysarthria and dysphagia can also result from LMN damage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75146\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75146 \">table 2</a>). Dysarthria may result from weakness of the tongue, lips or palate. The speech is usually slurred and may have a nasal quality. Hoarseness may be caused by associated vocal cord weakness. Dysphagia results from tongue weakness with disruption of the oral phase of swallowing or from pharyngeal constrictor weakness with disruption of the pharyngeal phase of swallowing or both. Tongue weakness may lead to pocketing of food between the cheeks and gums. Pharyngeal weakness often manifests as coughing and choking on food, liquids or secretions such as saliva or mucus. Aspiration may result.</p><p>LMN weakness of the upper face may produce incomplete eye closure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75146\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75146 \">table 2</a>). In the lower face the result may be a poor lip seal that may contribute to drooling or sialorrhea particularly in patients with associated swallowing difficulty. LMN weakness of the masseter can cause difficulty chewing; when severe it may produce an inability to close the mouth. LMN weakness of the pterygoids may produce difficulty opening the mouth and moving the jaw from side to side. Severe masseter and pterygoid weakness may contribute to disarticulation of the temporomandibular joint.</p><p>LMN weakness affecting the trunk and spine may produce difficulty holding up the head and difficulty maintaining an erect posture as well as abdominal protuberance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F67913\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67913 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>LMN weakness of the diaphragm produces progressive dyspnea with decreasing amounts of effort culminating in dyspnea at rest and with talking along with reduced vocal volume (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F58537\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58537 \">table 4</a>). Diaphragmatic weakness may also result in orthopnea and sleep disordered breathing.</p><p>Extraocular motor neurons residing in the nuclei of the oculomotor (CN III), trochlear (CN IV) and abducens (CN VI) nerves are spared until very late in the disease course. Patients who choose long-term mechanical ventilation have a longer clinical course that can include progressive difficulty with ocular motility. This may culminate in the locked-in-state, a clinical condition characterized by inability to move any voluntary muscle. Such patients may be alert and awake but completely unable to communicate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a well-established link between ALS and frontotemporal executive dysfunction that may precede or follow the onset of upper <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lower motor neuron dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/37-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-42</a>]. The frequency of frontotemporal executive dysfunction in patients with ALS varies in previous reports from 28 percent to 100 percent. The three largest series found evidence of cognitive impairment in 35 to 51 percent of patients with ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/37,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,43,44</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, most patients with ALS do not have overt dementia, and when present, cognitive impairment is typically subtle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In the largest report, the proportion of patients with ALS who met criteria for frontotemporal dementia (FTD) was 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Retrospective data suggest that ALS with FTD may be associated with shorter survival than ALS with normal executive and behavioral function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. ALS with FTD may be a familial disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis#H1808661\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&quot;, section on 'C9ORF72 gene'</a>.)</p><p>The presentation of FTD may be dramatic and initially suggestive of a psychiatric disorder because of change in personality, impairment of judgment, and development of obsessional behaviors. It may also manifest as a disorder of language called primary progressive aphasia (also semantic aphasia or semantic dementia). Short-term memory and spatial abilities are usually spared early in the course. However, the precise clinical and neuropathologic features of ALS associated with dementia remain to be defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/40,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,46</a>].

Constipation occurs frequently and is likely multifactorial. Delayed colonic motility has been demonstrated. Dysphagia for thin liquids related to pharyngeal muscle weakness may lead to dehydration that can exacerbate constipation. Symptoms of early satiety and bloating consistent with delayed gastric emptying also occur as the disease progresses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. Urinary urgency without incontinence is common, while incontinence is uncommon.</p><p>Some patients complain of excessive sweating, but whether a disorder of sweating occurs in association with ALS is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. Abnormal sympathetic activity with hyperhidrosis in early ALS and a reduction in sweat production as the disease progresses has been demonstrated in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Cases of ALS associated with autonomic disturbances have been reported. As examples, an individual from a Japanese ALS 1 (SOD 1 Gly93Ser) kindred had prominent sensory impairment, urinary disturbance, and blood pressure fluctuation due to sympathetic hyperactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Another individual with ALS and the locked-in-state related to a rare SOD1 mutation (Val118Leu) developed cardiac arrest following autonomic failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

These extrapyramidal features may include facial masking, tremor, bradykinesia, and postural instability.</p><p>At times, a supranuclear gaze abnormality occurs that is similar to that seen in progressive supranuclear palsy. A case report of a man presenting with symptoms and signs of ALS along with clinical features resembling progressive supranuclear palsy included autopsy evidence of degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, as well as widespread TDP-43 inclusion pathology that included the basal ganglia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Sensory symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sensory symptoms may occur in 20 to 30 percent of patients with ALS, but the sensory examination is usually normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/1,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,56</a>]. It is not uncommon for patients with ALS, particularly those with distal limb onset of symptoms, to complain of tingling paresthesia (see <a href=\"#H2435467958\" class=\"local\">'Pain'</a> below). When queried regarding sensory loss, these patients typically will deny loss of sensation, and physical examination does not detect objective sensory loss. At times, however, objective sensory loss may occur as part of an ALS-plus syndrome and may precede or follow motor symptoms. Electrophysiologic studies may demonstrate reduction of amplitudes on sensory nerve conduction and or slowing of dorsal column conduction on somatosensory evoked potential testing, even in patients without sensory findings on examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/56-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-60</a>].

Reduced mobility predisposes to skin breakdown and musculoskeletal pain. Respiratory symptoms and interventions can lead to pain, with discomfort and skin breakdown from noninvasive ventilation masks, and irritation from suctioning of secretions and weighing and pulling of ventilator hoses. In addition, pain with neuropathic features (eg, paresthesia, allodynia, hyperalgesia) may affect some patients with ALS. Although generally of mild to moderate intensity, pain in the later stages of ALS can be severe enough to necessitate treatment with analgesic and sedative medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/61,63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,63,64</a>].</p><p>A systematic review published in 2017 found that prevalence of pain in patients with ALS ranged from 15 to 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

Dysphagia poses a risk for aspiration of food, liquids, or secretions with resultant pneumonia and may also lead to malnutrition and dehydration. These conditions can be minimized in patients who choose gastrostomy tube insertion and with aggressive management of secretions.

Upper motor neuron findings of weakness, hyperreflexia, and spasticity result from degeneration of frontal motor neurons. The lower motor neuron findings of weakness, atrophy or amyotrophy, and fasciculations are a direct consequence of degeneration of lower motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinicopathologic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ALS is one of multiple degenerative motor neuron diseases that are clinically defined, based on the involvement of upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons. The spectrum of motor neuron disease includes progressive muscular atrophy, primary lateral sclerosis, and progressive bulbar palsy, all of which may be variants of ALS, or represent different patterns of evolution to ALS. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Spectrum of motor neuron disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymmetric limb weakness is the most common presentation of ALS (80 percent). Bulbar onset, usually manifested as dysarthria or dysphagia, is the next most common pattern (20 percent). However, differences in site and segment (cranial, cervical, thoracic, or lumbosacral) of onset, pattern and speed of spread, and the degree of upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction produce a disorder that is remarkably variable between individuals. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Clinical patterns of progression'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Upper motor neuron symptoms'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Lower motor neuron symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive impairment, typically related to frontotemporal executive dysfunction, may precede or follow the onset of upper motor neuron <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lower motor neuron dysfunction in patients with ALS. Frontotemporal dementia may be associated with ALS in 15 to 50 percent of cases.
