The organ systems most reliant on aerobic metabolism are preferentially affected. Myopathy may be the sole or main sign, or merely an incidental finding associated with a multisystemic illness. Involvement of the nervous system in general (referred to as mitochondrial encephalomyopathy) is common. When skeletal muscle is affected, either alone or with central nervous system disease, the term mitochondrial myopathy is used. Although mitochondria are known to play a role in diverse cellular functions including redox balance, apoptosis, fatty acid oxidation, and calcium homeostasis, this review will focus on the treatment of mitochondrial diseases due to pathologic dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.</p><p>The following groups illustrate the different ways mitochondrial myopathies can present clinically:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (with or without mild proximal muscle weakness) or Kearns-Sayre syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As an isolated myopathy with or without exercise intolerance <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> myalgia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As a severe myopathy or encephalomyopathy of infancy and childhood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As a predominantly multisystem disease (eg, mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes&nbsp;[MELAS])</p><p/><p>A certain degree of overlap exists between all these entities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H175969070\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mitochondrial myopathies: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>This topic will discuss symptomatic management of mitochondrial myopathies and review the evidence for exercise and pharmacologic agents, concentrating on those with more robust or more promising evidence. Finally, strategies for gene therapy will be introduced. Other aspects of mitochondrial myopathies are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitochondrial-structure-function-and-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mitochondrial structure, function, and genetics&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mitochondrial myopathies: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mainstay of current treatment for patients with mitochondrial myopathies is supportive. Depending on the degree of impairment and the extent of neurologic involvement, the following evaluations and interventions may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory care &ndash; This is often a life-saving or life-sustaining measure in patients with chronic respiratory failure. A discussion of respiratory or sleep-related symptoms should occur regularly with the patient and family. Pulmonary function tests should be obtained at baseline and again as clinically indicated when symptoms appear. Interventions include noninvasive measures such as continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive air pressure (BiPAP). Some patients may eventually require tracheostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control of seizures &ndash; Standard anticonvulsant therapy can be used to control seizures. An exception is that valproic acid and its derivatives should be avoided if possible because they inhibit the biosynthesis of carnitine, potentially leading to impaired mitochondrial beta-oxidation and fatty acid metabolism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiologic assessment for cardiomyopathy and conduction defects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ophthalmologic evaluation &ndash; Ptosis can be treated with frontalis muscle-eyelid suspension, levator palpebrae resection, eyelid crutches, or blepharoplasty. Cataracts are treated with intraocular lens replacement. Ophthalmoplegia usually does not require any specific intervention, but can be addressed by glasses with corrective prisms when accompanied by significant diplopia. Strabismus surgery is also an option if the degree of ophthalmoplegia is stable for at least six months on serial measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Audiologic evaluation &ndash; Sensorineural hearing loss can be addressed with cochlear implants. Aminoglycosides should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Drugs to avoid'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening for diabetes mellitus &ndash; Diabetes can be managed with dietary modification, oral agents, or insulin as appropriate. However, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> should be avoided because it has been associated with lactic acidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-poisoning#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metformin poisoning&quot;, section on 'Lactic acidosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multidisciplinary speech, physical, and occupational therapy &ndash; This can be helpful for patients with central nervous system deficits such as dysarthria, dysphagia, weakness, spasticity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive evaluation and appropriate intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of liver and pancreatic function &ndash; Many medications used to treat epilepsy are metabolized by the liver and may be affected by liver dysfunction. Pancreatic enzymes (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancrelipase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pancrelipase</a>) can be used to treat exocrine pancreas dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic counseling &ndash; As defined by the National Society of Genetic Counselors, genetic counseling is the process of helping people understand and adapt to the medical, psychological and familial implications of genetic contributions to disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Inheritance of mitochondrial diseases may be maternal, autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked. Transmission can be complex due to several factors including heteroplasmy, denoting variable levels of mitochondrial mutations in different tissues (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitochondrial-structure-function-and-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mitochondrial structure, function, and genetics&quot;</a>). Parents of severely affected children, in particular, and affected patients of reproductive age should be offered genetic counseling to help with reproductive planning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutritional support for patients with dysphagia, diabetes, weight loss, or exocrine pancreas dysfunction &ndash; In these cases, consultation with a nutritionist is indicated. A gastrostomy tube may be required if severe dysphagia is present. Specific diets may be used depending on both the nutritional status of the patient and the specific biochemical defect present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of renal and adrenal function &ndash; Renal function can be impaired due to proximal or distal renal tubule acidosis or as a complication of diabetes and may lead to significant electrolyte abnormalities. Although adrenal failure is not common overall in mitochondrial disease, it does occur in Kearns-Sayre syndrome and can be life-threatening.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EXERCISE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise appears to be beneficial in mitochondrial disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Aerobic exercise has been associated with increased peak work, oxidative capacity, and mitochondrial volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. In addition, aerobic exercise can prevent muscle deconditioning and decrease exercise intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>There is also some evidence that the response to resistance training exercise can alter the proportion of mutant and wild-type mitochondrial DNA (ie, gene shifting) in regenerated muscle fibers by activating wild-type satellite cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/12,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,15</a>]. However, it is not clear whether this is a viable strategy to reduce the burden of mutant mitochondrial DNA in muscle and thereby improve muscle function.</p><p>Given these data, we suggest routine moderate level aerobic exercise (eg, walking, running, cycling, or swimming) combined with regular mild resistance strength training for patients with mitochondrial disorders who are able to participate in physical activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no proven effective therapy for the primary mitochondrial disorders, although many agents are being evaluated in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Pharmacologic strategies that have been tested for these conditions include the use of respiratory chain cofactors, treatment with antioxidants, and agents that correct secondary biochemical deficits. Much of the evidence comes from single case reports and small open-label studies. A systematic review published in 2012 identified 12 randomized controlled trials that evaluated pharmacologic agents for mitochondrial diseases, but no clear evidence was found to support the use of any intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Although not established as effective for mitochondrial disorders, our typical regimen for adults and adolescents is coenzyme Q10 (400 mg daily), creatine 10 g daily, and L-carnitine (990 mg daily in three divided doses).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory chain cofactors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Succinate, riboflavin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a>, and coenzyme Q10 participate as cofactors in the electron transport chain enzymes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F67253\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67253 \">figure 1</a>). Supplementation is thought to enhance the activity of these enzymes when they are deficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Although evidence of possible modest benefit with coenzyme Q10 is sparse, we suggest it for patients with primary mitochondrial disorders, as discussed in the next section.</p><p>Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) replacement therapy (10 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> day in children and up to 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in adults) was associated with stable or substantially improved function in case reports of patients with riboflavin transporter deficiency, and there were no observed adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, there is no evidence for its use in other mitochondrial diseases.</p><p>There is no evidence that supplementation with succinate or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> is useful in patients with mitochondrial disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Coenzyme Q10</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While treatment seems clearly indicated in primary or secondary coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) deficiency (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Coenzyme Q10 deficiency'</a> below), CoQ10 has also been used to treat mitochondrial disorders in which CoQ10 levels are not known or are not reduced. Coenzyme Q10 is both an antioxidant (as discussed in the next section) and an integral part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, where it acts as an electron acceptor. It is uncertain which (if either) of these roles is beneficial when CoQ10 supplementation is used for patients with mitochondrial disorders. However, for patients with CoQ10 deficiency, benefit probably derives from its function as an electron carrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Coenzyme Q10 deficiency'</a> below.)</p><p>Coenzyme Q10 has been evaluated in small randomized controlled trials, with equivocal results.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A placebo-controlled blinded crossover design evaluated 30 patients with various mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, including 15 with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and 11 with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Treatment with CoQ10 (1200 mg daily) for 60 days did <strong>not</strong> lead to improvement in clinical measures such as grip strength, activities of daily living, or quality of life but did increase oxygen uptake (VO2) after 15 minutes of exercise and attenuated the rise in lactate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another double-blind crossover trial evaluated eight patients with various mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, including three with MELAS, who took CoQ10 (160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> for three months and placebo for one month, followed by a one month wash out period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Coenzyme Q10 treatment led to a statistically significant increase in a global scale of muscle strength and an increase in serum levels of CoQ10.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The earliest trial evaluated 17 patients with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia and was negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p>Given the evidence of modest benefit in one trial, and the lack of serious side effects, we suggest treatment with CoQ10 for patients with mitochondrial disorders. The suggested dose is 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day for infants and children and 400 mg daily for adolescents and adults. Higher doses are suggested for patients who have mitochondrial disease with CoQ10 deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Coenzyme Q10 deficiency'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Antioxidants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mitochondrial diseases in general result in an increase in oxidative stress and higher levels of reactive oxygen species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This may cause damage to the cell membrane through lipid peroxidation.</p><p>A number of antioxidants have been used to treat patients with mitochondrial myopathies, with the rationale that scavenging reactive oxygen species would lead to clinical improvement. The list includes coenzyme Q10, idebenone, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a>, and dihydrolipoate. While some reports suggested partial improvement in clinical function <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biochemical parameters in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>], there is no convincing evidence that use of vitamin E or dihydrolipoate leads to a clinically meaningful benefit. The evidence for coenzyme Q10 and idebenone is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Coenzyme Q10'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3940777071\" class=\"local\">'Idebenone'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3940777071\"><span class=\"h3\">Idebenone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idebenone (a synthetic analogue of coenzyme Q10) was tested in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of 85 patients with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. There was no benefit with idebenone by intention-to-treat analysis for the primary outcome (best recovery in visual acuity). However, there was a trend for improved vision, and a post hoc analysis suggested benefit for a subgroup of patients with discordant visual acuity between eyes at baseline. These data led to the approval of idebenone in 2015 by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of visual impairment in adolescent and adult patients with LHON.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Correcting secondary biochemical deficits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Levels of carnitine, creatine, and folate are decreased in patients with mitochondrial disorders, although the exact mechanisms are unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Given the relative harmless effect of their supplementation, they are often given as part of a &quot;mitochondrial cocktail&quot; to patients. However, there is no compelling evidence that supplementation of these agents produces a clinically important benefit. Nevertheless, we suggest treatment with creatine and L-carnitine for patients with mitochondrial disorders, as discussed in the next sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Creatine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two small trials tested creatine for mitochondrial disorders, with conflicting results.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a placebo-controlled crossover trial involving six patients (five with MELAS and one with a mitochondrial myopathy), treatment with creatine (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> for two weeks followed by 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> for one week) resulted in improvement in some variables, including a statistically significant 20 percent increase in hand grip strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, there was no improvement in activities of daily living.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second placebo-controlled crossover trial involving 16 patients with a mitochondrial disorder (including 13 with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia) found no significant benefit after four weeks with high dose creatine (20 g daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p>In another placebo-controlled crossover trial that analyzed results from 16 patients with various mitochondrial disorders, treatment with a combination of creatine, coenzyme Q10, and lipoic acid resulted in a reduction of serum lactate and a reduction in the decline of peak ankle dorsiflexion strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, there was no effect on pulmonary function, or on peak handgrip or knee extension strength.</p><p>Given the evidence from at least one controlled trial of possible modest benefit, and its relative lack of side effects, we suggest creatine to most of our patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathies.</p><p>The optimal creatine dose is uncertain. For adolescents and adults, one trial used 10 g daily for the first two weeks, followed by 4 g daily for maintenance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, cramps can be a problem at such high doses. For that reason, we usually start creatine at 4.5 g daily given in three divided doses, and titrate it up as tolerated, with a maximum total daily dose of 10 g. For infants and young children, creatine doses from 0.08 to 0.35 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> daily have been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Carnitine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>L-carnitine (levocarnitine) has not been studied in controlled trials in the context of primary mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders. However, carnitine supplementation can be almost curative in primary systemic carnitine deficiency, which typically presents in childhood with dilated cardiomyopathy.

Cerebral folate deficiency has been associated with several mitochondrial disorders including patients with Kearns-Sayre syndrome, the syndrome of neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP), Leigh syndrome, and mitochondrial encephalopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Cerebral folate deficiency is not limited to mitochondrial disease and occurs with other disorders including an autoimmune form with folate-receptor blocking antibodies, Rett syndrome, and Aicardi-Gouti&egrave;res Syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Some authors suggest high dose folinic acid supplementation (from 0.5 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) for mitochondrial disease although this is based only on reports of improvement in a small number of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Select mitochondrial disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coenzyme Q10 deficiency is responsive to high-dose coenzyme Q10 therapy.

Absence of thymidine phosphorylase leads to toxic substrate (thymidine) accumulation in the plasma and imbalance in the nucleotide pool, causing dysfunctional mitochondrial DNA replication. Mitochondrial DNA point mutations, multiple deletions, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> depletion have been observed. In patients with residual thymidine phosphorylase activity of &lt;10 percent, life expectancy is limited to the fourth decade.

The mitochondrial cytopathy results from energy failure due to defective mitochondrial energy production in brain tissue. The mitochondrial angiopathy is a result of abnormal mitochondria in the endothelial and smooth muscles cells of the cerebral arterioles and capillaries, which causes impairment of vasodilation.</p><p>Both L-arginine and citrulline are precursors to nitric oxide, which mediates vasodilation. In addition, L-arginine may also have a positive effect on aerobic capacity and muscle metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arginine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Arginine</a> supplementation has been used as a strategy to treat patients with MELAS, both as an infusion in the acute phase of the stroke-like episodes, and as an oral daily therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>].</p><p>In an open-label pilot study, L-arginine infusion (0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg)</span> or placebo was given in an approximately 2:1 ratio during the acute phase of 34 stroke-like episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. L-arginine was associated with a statistically significant short-term (24 hours) improvement in clinical symptoms. In the same study, oral L-arginine (4 to 24 g daily) was given to six patients with MELAS for 18 months, with a reduction in the frequency and severity of stroke symptoms compared with baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Both arginine and citrulline supplementation were associated with increased nitric oxide production; the increase was greater with citrulline, suggesting that citrulline should be studied for the treatment of MELAS.</p><p>However, controlled trials are needed to establish whether <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arginine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arginine</a> and citrulline treatment are beneficial in MELAS patients.</p><p>Stroke-like episodes in MELAS are often triggered by seizure, which causes energy depletion, neuronal injury, and breakdown of the blood-brain-barrier, which in turn leads to vasogenic edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Therefore, treatment of stroke-like episodes with anticonvulsants and high-dose glucocorticoids such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> may be beneficial.

In a United States-based open-label study, five legally blind patients with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) due to ND4 gene mutations in mitochondrial DNA were treated with an intravitreal injection of an adeno-associated virus vector containing the wild-type ND4 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. No serious safety issues were identified during 90 to 180 days of follow-up. Two of the five participants experienced an improvement in vision in the first 90 days. In a similar Chinese study, nine patients with LHON were treated, and were without complications over nine months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Controversy exists as to whether ND4 protein expression is truly increased inside the mitochondria. Further studies are needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing the ratio of wild-type DNA to mutant DNA (ie, to manipulate the level of heteroplasmy), a method known as &quot;gene shifting&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment/abstract/64,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,67</a>].
