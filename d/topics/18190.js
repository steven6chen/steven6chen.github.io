Catabolism of the nucleic acids to uric acid leads to hyperuricemia, and the marked increase in uric acid excretion can result in the precipitation of uric acid in the renal tubules and can also induce renal vasoconstriction, impaired autoregulation, decreased renal blood flow, and inflammation, resulting in acute kidney injury. Hyperphosphatemia with calcium phosphate deposition in the renal tubules can also cause acute kidney injury.</p><p>TLS most often occurs after the initiation of cytotoxic therapy in patients with high-grade lymphomas (particularly the Burkitt subtype) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, TLS can occur spontaneously and with other tumor types that have a high proliferative rate, large tumor burden, or high sensitivity to cytotoxic therapy.</p><p>The pathogenesis, definition, classification, risk factors, etiology, and clinical presentation of TLS will be reviewed here. Prevention and treatment of TLS are discussed elsewhere, as are issues related to treatment of the particular malignancies that are associated with TLS.

With the emergence of new effective and targeted anticancer drugs or new combinations of drugs, tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) has also been observed in patients with cancers that were previously rarely associated with this complication. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>This releases massive quantities of intracellular contents (potassium, phosphate, and nucleic acids that can be metabolized to uric acid) into the systemic circulation. The metabolic consequences include hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, secondary hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and acute kidney injury. High levels of both uric acid and phosphate increase the severity of acute kidney injury because uric acid precipitates readily in the presence of calcium phosphate crystals, and calcium phosphate precipitates readily in the presence of uric acid crystals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H491572\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperuricemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperuricemia is a consequence of the catabolism of purine nucleic acids to hypoxanthine and xanthine, and then to uric acid via the enzyme xanthine oxidase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79178\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79178 \">figure 1</a>). Uric acid is poorly soluble in water, particularly in the usually acidic environment in the distal tubules and collecting system of the kidney. Overproduction and overexcretion of uric acid in TLS can lead to crystal precipitation and deposition in the renal tubules, and acute uric acid nephropathy with acute kidney injury.

When the calcium concentration times phosphate concentration (the calcium phosphate product) exceeds 60 mg<sup>2</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/dL<sup>2</sup>,</span> there is an increased risk of calcium phosphate precipitation in the renal tubules, which can lead to acute kidney injury. In addition, precipitation in the heart may lead to cardiac arrhythmias.

Xanthine is much less soluble than uric acid, and urinary alkalinization increases the solubility of xanthine much less than the solubility of uric acid because the pKa is much higher for xanthine (7.4 versus 5.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-lysis-syndrome-definition-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-etiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Thus, patients with massive TLS who are receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> are at risk for xanthine precipitation in the tubules, resulting in xanthine nephropathy or xanthine stone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-lysis-syndrome-definition-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-etiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. Because the serum xanthine level is not routinely measured, its effect on the risk of acute kidney injury is not certain. In contrast to the effect of allopurinol, xanthine concentration is not increased by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rasburicase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rasburicase</a> (recombinant urate oxidase), which is now preferred in most patients at high risk for TLS. Rasburicase promotes the degradation of uric acid to the much more water-soluble compound allantoin. However, in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, hydrogen peroxide, a breakdown product of uric acid, can cause methemoglobinemia and, in severe cases, hemolytic anemia. For this reason, rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency.

However, they did not make a specific recommendation as to which score should be used as the cutoff for the use of rasburicase versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a>. In general, these models are complex, and they lack standardized guidelines for supportive care guidelines.

Deposition of uric acid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> calcium phosphate crystals in the renal tubules can result in acute kidney injury. (See <a href=\"#H491545\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory TLS is defined as any two or more of the following metabolic abnormalities and presents within three days before or seven days after instituting chemotherapy: hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F59424\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59424 \">table 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical TLS is defined as laboratory TLS plus one or more of the following that was not directly or probably attributable to a therapeutic agent: increased serum creatinine concentration (&ge;1.5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]), cardiac <span class=\"nowrap\">arrhythmia/sudden</span> death, or a seizure. A grading system for TLS based upon the severity of clinical TLS is presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72208 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TLS is observed most frequently in patients with high-grade lymphomas (particularly the Burkitt subtype) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia following the initiation of cytotoxic therapy, although it may also occur spontaneously <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in other tumor types with a high proliferative rate, large tumor burden, or high sensitivity to cytotoxic therapy. However, with the development of effective targeted therapy, TLS is now being reported in cancers that previously were only rarely associated with this complication (eg, colon cancer; chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venetoclax-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venetoclax</a>; chronic myeloid leukemia; and lymphoid malignancies treated with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk stratification based upon tumor-related and patient-related factors can permit an assessment of the risk of TLS, which may assist in selecting therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57607\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57607 \">table 4</a>).
