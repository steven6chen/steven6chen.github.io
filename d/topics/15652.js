This topic will review the impact of PFD (pelvic organ prolapse, stress urinary incontinence, anal incontinence) and their treatment on sexual function.

Avoidance of intercourse has been reported to occur in 11-45 percent of women with urinary incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. Women with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse are less likely to engage in sexual relations and more likely to note sexual dysfunction compared with their asymptomatic counterparts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/2,7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7-10</a>]. In a retrospective review of women undergoing urogynecologic surgery, nearly one-third indicated that they avoided sexual activity because of pelvic floor symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Treatment of PFD can reduce sexual dysfunction. Studies using validated questionnaires report improved sexual function in up to 70 percent of women treated for PFD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/2,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12,13</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Women with prolapse also report poorer body image [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In one study, women with prolapse &ge;Stage 2 reported feeling isolated and less attractive, and often changed sexual intimacy practices or avoided sexual intimacy altogether [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>The extent of sexual dysfunction in women with PFD is difficult to ascertain because of varied definitions of dysfunction and because affected patients may not present for treatment or report the problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/16-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55347950\"><span class=\"h1\">RESEARCH TOOLS FOR ASSESSMENT OF SEXUAL FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In research studies, the validated questionnaires specifically developed to assess sexual function in women with urinary incontinence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pelvic organ prolapse are the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ) and its 12-question short form, the PISQ-12 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/13,26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,26-29</a>]. Limitations of the PISQ include that it has only been validated in female heterosexual activity, it has not been validated in women with anal incontinence, and it was designed to be administered to women who have engaged in sexual relations in the last six months. Subsequently, an international group of investigators revised the PISQ; the newer version, PISQ-IR, includes both women who report that they are sexually active as well as women who report no sexual activity. Importantly, women with fecal incontinence were included in the validation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].</p><p>General questionnaires which focus on sexual function include the Female&nbsp;Sexual&nbsp;Function Index (FSFI) and the&nbsp;Sexual&nbsp;History Form 12, which were designed to evaluate&nbsp;sexual&nbsp;function and have undergone validation and reliability testing in a general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. General questionnaires are not condition-specific and may not be sensitive enough to detect differences due to PFD. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67392630\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FINDINGS AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with PFD typically have urinary or anal incontinence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse, which include vaginal bulging, pelvic pressure, and splinting or digitation to pass urine or stool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Incontinence is diagnosed with history, physical exam, and simple office tests. Pelvic exam confirms the anatomy of prolapse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence#H21990309\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of women with urinary incontinence&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.) </p><p>Female sexual dysfunction takes different forms, including lack of sexual desire, impaired arousal, inability to achieve orgasm, or pain with sexual activity. The diagnosis of female sexual dysfunction is based upon the presence of diagnostic criteria obtained through a medical and sexual history. To meet criteria for sexual dysfunction, a sexual problem must be recurrent or persistent and cause personal distress or interpersonal difficulty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

In general, we begin treatment with less invasive options and proceed to surgical options as needed, or if the patient desires a different treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Sexual history'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H342282589\"><span class=\"h2\">Assess sexual function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While validated questionnaires to evaluate sexual function exist, most are too long to screen for sexual problems in the clinical setting. A questionnaire consisting of three questions has been proven as effective as in-depth interviews in identifying sexual problems and can be readily implemented in the clinical setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Based on this, we ask the following questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are you sexually active?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you have any problems with sexual activity?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you have any pain with sexual activity?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H342282602\"><span class=\"h2\">Discuss the impact of PFD and PFD treatment on sexual function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many women and their partners feel that sexual activity is contraindicated or impossible in the setting of prolapse <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> incontinence and that sexual activity will lead to harm of the patient or her partner. We provide reassurance that sexual activity will not harm the patient or the partner, nor worsen the prolapse or incontinence.</p><p>As these are difficult topics for many patients to discuss, we initiate specific conversations regarding sexual function and dysfunction, expectations for sexual function after treatment, the timing of resumption of sexual activity after surgery, the use of lubricants if sexual activity has not been attempted for a prolonged period of time, and what to do if sexual problems arise. </p><p>Following reconstructive vaginal or urinary anti-incontinence surgery, there is no evidence that sexual activity harms repairs, and couples can be reassured that they can resume sexual activity after clearance by their provider. Treatment of the underlying pelvic floor dysfunction typically results in resolution of sexual symptoms specifically associated with the dysfunction. For example, women with coital incontinence are likely to report improvement in coital incontinence after treatment but less likely to report improvement in desire, arousal, and orgasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H342282608\"><span class=\"h2\">Screen for sexual issues that may impact treatment</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471318025\"><span class=\"h3\">Desire for vaginal sex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Desire for future vaginal sexual activity will dictate what type of treatment the patient will be offered. As an example, women who choose colpocleisis, or vaginal obliterative procedures, need to be counseled that future vaginal intercourse is impossible after the procedure. Among women who elect colpocleisis and who are not sexually active, regret is low and satisfaction high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H342282614\"><span class=\"h3\">Sexual pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most PFDs are not painful, and women reporting sexual pain disorders such as dyspareunia in the setting of prolapse <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> incontinence are counseled that treatment of their PFD will not necessarily result in improvement in their underlying pain with sex. Conversely, among women with PFD who do not have sexual complaints at baseline, a small but significant number of women report worsened sexual function following treatment, including de novo dyspareunia. As an example, in a meta-analysis of native-tissue pelvic organ prolapse repair, 4 percent of women had new onset dyspareunia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>Because of the association of mesh with pain following surgery, many surgeons advise against the placement of mesh in these women, or placement only following extensive counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Likewise, use of a pessary to treat either incontinence or prolapse in the setting of pelvic floor pain is challenging and will likely result in exacerbation of the pain and discontinuation of use of the pessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H342282627\"><span class=\"h3\">Sexual practices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general varied sexual practices are not contraindicated or of concern in women with pelvic floor dysfunction. For women with anal incontinence, anoreceptive intercourse may be an exception. Up to 20 percent of women regularly engage in anal intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].

Body image studies highlight the multi-factorial nature of sexual health in women with prolapse, and the need to address physical and mental components of sexual health in any treatment plan.</p><p>While surgical repair of prolapse is generally helpful, de novo dyspareunia has been reported in 1 to 28 percent of women following various prolapse repair procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/49,55-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,55-62</a>].

In general, we suggest conservative management, including pelvic floor therapy, prior to proceeding with surgery for urinary incontinence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55345213\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-surgical treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with urinary incontinence who received pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) reported improvement in sexual function in observational and randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/84-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-86</a>]. While the exact mechanism is unknown, PFMT in women with SUI has been reported to improve sexual desire and ability to achieve orgasm, and reduce dyspareunia, which is significant as dyspareunia may be worsened by surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. A study of 445 women randomly assigned to behavioral therapy (PFMT and continence strategies), pessary therapy, or combined therapy reported that successful treatment of SUI was associated with greater improvement in sexual function, greater reduction in incontinence during sexual activity, and greater reduction in restriction of sexual activity related to fear of incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Among those successfully treated for SUI, improvement in continence during sexual activity was greater in both behavioral therapy groups compared with the pessary-only group.</p><p>Obesity has been independently associated with worsening of both sexual dysfunction and urinary incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/88-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">88-91</a>]. However the available data on the complex interaction of sexual function, obesity, and urinary incontinence in women is mixed and further studies are needed. In one study of 366 obese and overweight women randomly assigned to a weight loss regimen, the intervention group lost significantly more weight and had greater improvement in urinary incontinence episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Despite the greater weight loss in the intervention group, a sub-analysis of sexually active women did not report improved sexual function compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. In contrast, subsequent studies of bariatric surgery have shown improvement in quality of life, including sexual function, after weight reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,94</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H141516474\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact of SUI surgery on female sexual function varies, but the majority of women reported unchanged or improved sexual function postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/42,95-106\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,95-106</a>]. A systematic review that analyzed studies published prior to 2009 and excluded studies with concomitant prolapse repair reported 55 percent of women had no change in sexual function after surgery, 32 percent had improved sexual function, and 13 percent had worsened sexual function after surgical treatment for SUI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The subanalysis of 1252 women who underwent midurethral sling procedures reported similar results. Sustained improvements in sexual function after surgery have been reported for the Burch urethropexy, fascial sling procedures and tension-free vaginal tape midurethral sling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/102,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,107</a>].</p><p>Women who reported worsening of sexual function postoperatively often cited de-novo dyspareunia as the cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/95,101,105,108-113\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,101,105,108-113</a>].

The occurrence of preexisting dyspareunia in women with stress incontinence complicates performance of these analyses. Studies have reported the prevalence of preoperative dyspareunia to be as high as 34 to 55 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/102,105,115\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,105,115</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55342736\"><span class=\"h1\">ANAL INCONTINENCE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55342763\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact on sexual function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anal incontinence (AI) (involuntary loss of flatus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> feces) and fecal incontinence (involuntary loss of feces, solid or liquid) have been implicated in contributing to sexual dysfunction, and are a reason for avoiding sexual relations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].

However, these studies were limited by small sample size and lack of a condition-specific sexual function questionnaire for anal incontinence at the time of these studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

Women with pelvic organ prolapse also report poorer body image. (See <a href=\"#H29291375\" class=\"local\">'Significance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with PFDs typically have urinary or anal incontinence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse, which include vaginal bulging, pelvic pressure, and splinting or digitation to pass urine or stool. Urinary incontinence is diagnosed with history, physical exam, and simple office tests. Pelvic exam confirms the anatomy of prolapse. (See <a href=\"#H67392630\" class=\"local\">'Clinical findings and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female sexual dysfunction takes different forms, including lack of sexual desire, impaired arousal, inability to achieve orgasm, or pain with sexual activity. To meet criteria for sexual dysfunction, a sexual problem must be recurrent or persistent and cause personal distress or interpersonal difficulty. (See <a href=\"#H67392630\" class=\"local\">'Clinical findings and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To evaluate these complex patients, we take a sexual history, discuss the impact of both PFD and its treatment on sexual function, and screen for specific issues that may impact treatment choice (eg, dyspareunia or anal incontinence). In general, we begin treatment with less invasive options and proceed to surgical options as needed or if the patient desires a different treatment. (See <a href=\"#H233962127\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual function generally worsens with increasing severity of pelvic organ prolapse. Nonsurgical treatment of pelvic organ prolapse with a pessary or pelvic floor muscle training may improve sexual dysfunction in some women and has no harmful effects. Surgical repair of prolapse is generally associated with improvements in sexual dysfunction but may also cause de-novo dyspareunia in up to 28 percent of women, especially if levatorplasty or transvaginal mesh is used in the repair. (See <a href=\"#H55342532\" class=\"local\">'Pelvic organ prolapse'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower urinary tract disorders such as stress urinary incontinence, overactive bladder syndrome (urinary urgency or frequency, with or without incontinence), and interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/bladder</span> pain syndrome are all associated with sexual dysfunction, although it is unclear if one disorder causes more sexual dysfunction. Treatment of stress incontinence with pelvic floor muscle therapy may improve sexual function. Meta-analysis of surgical treatments of stress incontinence reported approximately 55 percent of women had unchanged sexual function postoperatively, 32 percent had improved sexual function, and 13 percent had worsened sexual function. (See <a href=\"#H55344789\" class=\"local\">'Stress urinary incontinence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anal incontinence may adversely affect sexual function in women with pelvic floor disorders and has been implicated as a reason for avoidance of sexual activity. The effect of surgical treatment of anal incontinence on sexual function is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H55342736\" class=\"local\">'Anal incontinence'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-function-in-women-with-pelvic-floor-and-lower-urinary-tract-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Laumann EO, Paik A, Glasser DB, et al.
