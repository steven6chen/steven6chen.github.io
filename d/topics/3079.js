Creatine kinase (CK) levels are typically markedly elevated, and muscle pain and myoglobinuria may be present. The severity of illness ranges from asymptomatic elevations in serum muscle enzymes to life-threatening disease associated with extreme enzyme elevations, electrolyte imbalances, and acute kidney injury.</p><p>The causes of rhabdomyolysis will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis; the clinical features and diagnosis of acute kidney injury due to rhabdomyolysis; the management of patients with rhabdomyolysis, including methods to prevent acute kidney injury and related metabolic complications; and the prevention and management of acute compartment syndrome are discussed in detail separately.

The final common pathway for injury is an increase in intracellular free ionized cytoplasmic and mitochondrial calcium. This may be caused by depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cellular source of energy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> by direct injury and rupture of the plasma membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The latter pathway of injury also results in ATP depletion.</p><p>The increased intracellular calcium leads to activation of proteases, increased skeletal muscle cell contractility, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the production of reactive oxygen species, resulting in skeletal muscle cell death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. ATP depletion causes dysfunction of the <span class=\"nowrap\">Na/K-ATPase</span> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>ATPase pumps that are essential to maintaining integrity of the myocyte. ATP depletion leads to myocyte injury and the release of intracellular muscle constituents, including creatine kinase (CK) and other muscle enzymes, myoglobin, and various electrolytes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31734787\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are multiple potential causes of rhabdomyolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]; these can be broadly divided into three categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F60404\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60404 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traumatic or muscle compression (eg, crush syndrome or prolonged immobilization)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nontraumatic exertional (eg, marked exertion in untrained individuals, hyperthermia, or metabolic myopathies)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nontraumatic nonexertional (eg, drugs or toxins, infections, or electrolyte disorders)</p><p/><p>The specific cause is frequently evident from the history or from the immediate circumstances preceding the disorder, such as crush injury, a comatose or postictal state, postoperative surgical trauma, or extraordinary physical exertion. In other cases, however, the precipitant may not be as immediately evident but is identified through a careful history and physical and laboratory evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/4,5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7</a>]. The specific causes within each of the three major categories are discussed in detail in the sections below.</p><p>The relative frequency of the different etiologies among patients with rhabdomyolysis has been reported in several large series of hospitalized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/3,4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,8</a>]. In a study that included 2371 patients with rhabdomyolysis, the most frequently associated clinical conditions included trauma (26 percent), immobilization (18 percent), sepsis (10 percent), vascular surgery (8 percent) and cardiac surgery (6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In another series of 475 patients, the most common causes were exogenous toxins (46 percent), including alcohol and illicit drugs (34 percent) and medical drugs (11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Up to 60 percent of patients had more than one etiologic factor. Underlying myopathy or muscle metabolic defects were seen in 10 percent of the cases, in which there was a higher rate of recurrence and only one etiologic factor. No cause was identified in 7 percent of patients. Differences in the reported frequencies and the causes of rhabdomyolysis between these studies are likely related to differences in case ascertainment. (See <a href=\"#H31734829\" class=\"local\">'Drugs'</a> below.)</p><p>Another series with more than 50 patients focused on patients with infectious causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31734794\"><span class=\"h2\">Trauma or muscle compression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trauma or muscle compression is a common cause of rhabdomyolysis and can be seen in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A crush syndrome in victims of multiple traumata, particularly individuals trapped in cars after crashes or in collapsed buildings from earthquakes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].

Examples include extreme exertion or exertion under conditions in which muscle oxygenation is impaired, including metabolic myopathies.</p><p>Subclinical myoglobinemia, myoglobinuria, and elevation in serum creatine kinase (CK) are common following physical exertion. As an example, myoglobinemia was found in 25 of 44 participants (57 percent) in an ultra-marathon race of 99 kilometers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

The role of potassium in the regulation of skeletal muscle blood flow appears to be important in the pathogenesis in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. During exercise, there is normally an appropriate increase in muscle perfusion to meet enhanced energy demands. This hyperemic response is mediated in part by the release of potassium from skeletal muscle cells. The ensuing local elevation in the potassium concentration causes vasodilation, which enhances regional blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. However, the cellular release of potassium is impaired by potassium depletion. As a result, there is a lesser increase in blood flow, possibly resulting in cramps, ischemic necrosis, and rhabdomyolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Hypokalemia-induced impairment in muscle metabolism also may contribute to muscle dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p>Rhabdomyolysis can also occur in trained individuals following physical exertion in the absence of these risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/22,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,32</a>].</p><p>In addition, pathologic hyperkinetic states can lead to rhabdomyolysis in individuals with normal muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/3,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,33</a>].
