It is likely to have declined in recent years because of the decline in peptic ulcer disease, which has historically been an important cause of GOO. In 1990, as many as 2000 operations for GOO were performed annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Updated estimates are not available, but the need for surgery is thought to have declined because of advancements in endoscopic methods to treat GOO (such as dilation and stenting).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term gastric outlet obstruction is a misnomer since many cases are not due to isolated gastric pathology, but rather involve duodenal or extraluminal disease. The predominant causes have changed substantively with the identification of <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> and the use of proton pump inhibitors. Until the late 1970s, benign disease was responsible for the majority of cases of GOO in adults, while malignancy accounted for only 10 to 39 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. By contrast, in recent decades, 50 to 80 percent cases have been attributable to malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/2,4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pancreatic adenocarcinoma with extension to the duodenum or stomach is a common cause of malignant GOO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Fifteen to 25 percent of patients with pancreatic cancer present with GOO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Such patients also commonly have biliary obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].

However, the absolute number of cases has probably declined because of the decreased incidence of gastric cancer in developed nations and the increase in the proportion of gastric cancers arising from a proximal location.

Obstruction is now the least common complication of peptic ulcer disease, occurring in approximately 2 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Even in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES), 10 percent of whom develop duodenal or pyloric strictures, GOO now occurs rarely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the complications of peptic ulcer disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Both acute and chronic peptic ulcer disease can lead to GOO. The principal sites of involvement in cases of obstruction are the pyloric channel and the duodenal bulb. Acute peptic ulcers can cause obstruction via inflammation-induced edema and tissue deformation. By contrast, chronic peptic ulcer disease leads to scarring and tissue remodeling as part of the healing process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the complications of peptic ulcer disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Crohn disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinically significant gastroduodenal Crohn disease is uncommon, occurring in fewer than 5 percent of patients. When present, approximately 60 percent of patients have continuous disease that involves the antrum, pylorus, and proximal duodenum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The majority have concomitant disease in the distal gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most patients with gastroduodenal Crohn disease do not have symptoms attributable to the gastroduodenal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. On the other hand, obstruction due to Crohn-related strictures is the most common complication of gastroduodenal disease. In a series of 215 patients hospitalized for Crohn disease, 3 percent were being treated for symptomatic Crohn disease due to pyloric strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In another study of 89 patients with gastroduodenal Crohn disease, 33 patients required surgery, most often for duodenal obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic pancreatitis and, to a lesser extent, severe acute pancreatitis with involvement of the duodenum can cause duodenal obstruction. Case series report an incidence of approximately 1 to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/22-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-27</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of GOO in chronic pancreatitis is incompletely understood. One theory is that the obstruction develops from weeping of inflammatory exudates from the anterior pancreatic surface, which leads to inflammation and fibrosis in adjacent structures, most commonly the duodenum, jejunum, and transverse colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Patients with duodenal obstruction often have associated pancreatic and biliary duct strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Segmental chronic pancreatitis within the area between the pancreas and the duodenum has been termed &quot;groove pancreatitis.&quot; Both duodenal and biliary obstruction can occur, and the disease is often misdiagnosed as pancreatic malignancy. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Patients with severe acute pancreatitis can develop narrowing of the duodenum due to inflammation and edema in the pancreas. However, obstruction of the duodenum is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], except in cases of walled-off pancreatic necrosis (WOPN) after severe acute pancreatitis and large pseudocysts that can occur as a result of both acute and chronic pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-pancreatic-pseudocysts-and-walled-off-pancreatic-necrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of pancreatic pseudocysts and walled-off pancreatic necrosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-complications-of-chronic-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the complications of chronic pancreatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreatic-debridement#H265589\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreatic debridement&quot;, section on 'Walled-off pancreatic necrosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Caustic injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GOO secondary to caustic ingestion occurs due to fibrosis after resolution of the acute injury and inflammation, most commonly 6 to 12 weeks after initial ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Esophageal damage from ingestion of caustic liquids, either acidic or alkaline, is more common than gastroduodenal damage. The protection of the duodenum may be due to antral spasm after corrosive exposure, causing closure of the pylorus. In one cohort of 179 patients with caustic ingestions (either acid or alkali), esophageal injury was seen in 79 percent of patients, while gastric and duodenal injury were seen in 51 percent and 6 percent, respectively. There were five gastric strictures and two duodenal strictures resulting in GOO (4 percent), compared with 25 esophageal strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>A commonly held belief is that alkali ingestion causes severe esophageal damage but limited gastric injury due to the buffering action of acid. However, in one report, gastric injury was observed in 94 percent of 31 patients who ingested alkali [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The grades of esophageal and gastric injuries were similar. Eventual gastric stricture formation was noted in 32 percent (versus esophageal strictures in 45 percent). Duodenal strictures were seen in 6 percent.</p><p>Gastric injury to acid exposure can be similarly severe. In a prospective study of 41 patients who ingested corrosive acids, 84 percent developed acute gastric injury (typically severe, grade 2 or 3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Chronic sequelae (stricture, distal gastric deformity) were noted in 44 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Large gastric polyps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prolapse of a large antral polyp across the pylorus can rarely lead to GOO. Such polyps tend to be large (2 to 10 cm in size) and pedunculated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/32-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastric tuberculosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastroduodenal disease occurs in only 0.3 to 2.3 percent of patients with tuberculosis (TB). Clinically it may resemble peptic ulcer disease or malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/40-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-46</a>]. GOO is the most common complication of gastroduodenal TB; in one report, for example, GOO was the presenting feature in 61 percent of 23 patients with biopsy-proven gastroduodenal TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The obstruction may be secondary to infiltration of the gastric antrum or duodenum or to extrinsic compression by adenopathy or a phlegmon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/39,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastric bezoars</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A bezoar is a concretion formed by the gradual accumulation of ingested material, both inorganic and organic, most often in the gastric lumen.

Risk factors include absence of an external bolster (such as in the case of Foley catheters) and placement of the tube close to the pylorus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/51,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,54,55</a>].

Two etiologic factors predominate: diaphragmatic defects such as a paraesophageal hernia or diaphragmatic hernia of traumatic origin, and poor fixation of the stomach due to laxity or absence of the gastrosplenic or gastrocolic ligaments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Adhesive disease from previous surgery may serve as an axis for gastric rotation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>The rotation can occur around the long axis of the stomach, called organoaxial, or around the perpendicular axis, called mesenteroaxial. Obstruction and ischemia are more likely in mesenteroaxial twisting. Both acute and chronic gastric volvulus can cause GOO. The former occurs in approximately one-third of cases and is a surgical emergency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Other causes</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-surgical complications can result in GOO, but only in the setting of a preserved or partially preserved stomach such as sleeve gastrectomy, pylorus-preserving Whipple procedures, and gastrojejunostomies performed for GOO. Complications of bariatric surgery are reviewed separately.

The cause may be related to radiation enteropathy. Patients receiving gastrojejunostomies for GOO can develop anastomotic strictures, but recurrent symptoms are more often due to poor gastric emptying and disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bouveret syndrome is a rare but well-documented cause of GOO. It is characterized by the impaction of a large gallstone (a single stone in &gt;90 percent) within the pyloric channel or, more commonly, the duodenum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/61-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-65</a>].

It can also permit therapeutic procedures. Nasogastric tube suction is recommended before endoscopy to minimize retained fluid that may increase the risk of aspiration during endoscopy. Large bore tubes (eg, Ewald tubes) can achieve better clearance than standard smaller bore tubes.</p><p>Patients should fast for at least four hours or until returns from nasogastric suction begin to slow and clinical signs of decompression are evident. Fasting for prolonged periods is not necessary and may increase the amount of retained fluid if concurrent nasogastric tube suction is not performed since the stomach continues to produce significant amounts of secretions during fasting. Proton pump inhibitors, given parenterally, will decrease gastric secretions and reduce inflammation and should be considered regardless of the cause of GOO.</p><p>The obstructed stomach is typically filled with retained fluid and solid food, which should be aggressively suctioned to reduce the risk of aspiration. Passage of a standard adult endoscope across the stricture may not be possible if there is complete or near complete obstruction. Gentle attempts at passage through the stricture can be made, but are often unnecessary for a definitive diagnosis. Small diameter scopes can also be used to navigate tight strictures. If endoscopic therapy is sought, contrast injection with fluoroscopy can be helpful in delineating the stricture. Biliary retrieval balloons can be used to provide a seal over the stricture to increase the flow of contrast through tight strictures. Guidewires may be useful in therapeutic procedures.</p><p>Endoscopic biopsies often allow confirmation or exclusion of a malignant cause of GOO. However, routine biopsy techniques can have poor sensitivity, particularly if the tumor is extraluminal or does not involve the mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/4,5,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,81</a>]. Thus, patients who are felt to be at increased risk for a malignancy of the stomach, despite negative initial biopsies, should undergo additional testing. Patients should be considered at increased risk for a malignancy if they are older than 50 years of age and do not have a history of peptic ulcer disease, have a history of Crohn disease, or a family history of gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].

Thus, we suggest they be given in all cases, regardless of the underlying etiology. Parenteral nutrition should be started early if definitive therapy is not imminent.</p><p>Definitive treatment of the obstruction should be based upon the underlying etiology and may including stenting, chemotherapy, endoscopic balloon dilation, or surgery.

A systematic review of pre-2008 literature comparing endoscopic stenting with gastrojejunostomy suggested no difference in 30-day mortality, complication rates, or survival, but increased likelihood of tolerating oral intake, a shorter time until tolerating oral intake, and shorter hospital stays in patients undergoing endoscopic stenting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].

The optimal duration of a trial of medical therapy is not known, but we suggest three to seven days with careful and periodic reevaluation. The patient may then be challenged with a liquid diet or a contrast study can be performed with a nasogastric tube in place. Failure to tolerate a trial of liquids or failure of contrast to pass into the distal duodenum usually necessitates either endoscopic or surgical intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H149216035\"><span class=\"h4\">Endoscopic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who fail to respond to medical therapy may require endoscopic dilation or surgery. Endoscopic therapy is often successful in the short-term, but long-term results have historically been poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. The majority of these studies, however, were performed before the recognition of <em>H. pylori </em>as a key contributor to peptic ulcer disease and prior to the widespread use of proton pump inhibitors. In a more recent study, a durable response was obtained using large diameter through-the-scope (TTS) balloon dilation, careful removal of inciting factors, and acid suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. We suggest a trial of medical and endoscopic therapy as the initial treatment of choice prior to surgical intervention. In addition, before surgery is contemplated, it is imperative that biopsies be obtained to rule out malignancy, which has been reported in as many as 66 percent of patients in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/4,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,95</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p>If the pyloric channel can be identified and a balloon can be passed, dilation is an appropriate option in experienced hands. A water-soluble contrast study may be helpful to define the anatomy of the pylorus before dilation. If the pylorus can be opened sufficiently to allow the patient to tolerate a liquid diet, especially when an underlying cause can be reversed, then continuing medical treatment is a reasonable option as long as the patient is carefully monitored for recurrence. Monitoring symptoms is important, but it is advisable to also check a gastric residual, especially in patients who were previously asymptomatic despite large gastric residuals. </p><p>Dilation can be accomplished by using endoscopy and a TTS balloon dilator, or by using a balloon placed over a guidewire positioned under fluoroscopic guidance. While fluoroscopy may not be required for dilation using a TTS balloon in the case of mild strictures (eg, strictures that allow passage of an endoscope), most other stricture dilations are carried out using fluoroscopic guidance. The amount of dilation in a single session is determined by the initial diameter of the stricture. Narrow strictures may require stepwise dilation performed over multiple sessions, as is done with esophageal strictures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of benign esophageal strictures&quot;, section on 'Technique'</a>.)</p><p>Balloon dilation should be monitored by a pressure gauge. The balloon is inflated to the chosen diameter and inflation is sustained for 30 to 60 seconds. The dilation may then be repeated at the same diameter, though it is not certain that repeated dilations to the same diameter yield better results. Using dilute contrast medium to fill the balloon allows progress to be followed fluoroscopically; a waist forms initially during dilation, but is effaced during balloon distention. Successful dilation is usually confirmed by pulling the balloon through the strictured segment, although failure to accomplish this does not preclude a successful procedure. Symptoms are usually considerably improved with successful dilation to 12 mm. There may be an advantage to postponing dilation beyond 15 mm until after a period of medical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p>Long duodenal strictures are the most difficult to dilate. Multiple sessions using stepwise dilation for tight obstructions will likely lower the risk of perforation. Nevertheless, because of the risk of perforation, patients should be appropriately prepared for surgery before duodenal dilation and monitored closely after dilation before resuming oral intake. If there is concern about a possible perforation or if the dilation is unusually difficult to perform, an immediate postprocedure water-soluble study should be obtained.</p><p>Multiple sessions of endoscopic balloon dilation are necessary in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/16,94,97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,94,97,98</a>].

Dilation failed in four patients with long duodenal strictures, while two dilated to 18 mm suffered perforation; both recovered uneventfully after surgery. A good long-term response following dilation is often achieved when <em>H. pylori</em> is cured or NSAID use is discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H149216041\"><span class=\"h4\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is indicated if the pylorus is obstructed and cannot be safely dilated, or if the obstruction persists or recurs despite medical and endoscopic management.
