LGL leukemia arises most frequently from a T cell lineage (85 percent) or, less commonly, from a natural killer (NK) cell lineage (15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of NK cell LGL disorders will be discussed here. T cell LGL leukemia is discussed separately.

The absolute number of LGLs in the peripheral blood of normal subjects is 200 to <span class=\"nowrap\">400/microL</span>. LGLs arise from two major lineages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD3 positive, CD 57 positive, CD56 negative T cells, representing in vivo antigen-activated cytotoxic effector T cells</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD3-, CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells. It had been postulated that such NK cells mediate non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytotoxicity. It is now established that NK cells possess specific receptors for MHC class I molecules named &quot;killer-cell Ig-like inhibitory receptor&quot; (KIR) and &quot;killer-cell activating receptor&quot; (KAR). Interactions between these receptors and MHC class I molecules on target cells may inhibit or activate NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity.</p><p/><p>Secondary benign (nonclonal) LGL expansions have been reported in the following clinical situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral infections (eg, EBV, HBV, HCV, HIV, CMV), connective tissue disease, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), non-Hodgkin lymphoma, various skin disorders, and the hemophagocytosis syndrome are the main non-malignant situations that have been associated with reactive T cell LGL expansion (ie, CD3+ cells with T cell receptor genes in germline configuration) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/1,3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The myelodysplastic syndrome and solid tumors are sometimes associated with increased numbers of circulating NK LGL cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NK cell proliferative disorders have been found in atomic-bomb survivors presenting with neutropenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification of LGL disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A syndrome characterized by the proliferation of LGLs associated with neutropenia was initially reported in 1977 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Since then, several studies of LGL proliferative disorders have appeared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/1,3,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,8-10</a>].</p><p>The term LGL leukemia was proposed for this disorder based upon demonstration of invasion of bone marrow, spleen, and liver by LGLs and the first proof that such LGLs were clonally expanded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A subsequent French-American-British (FAB) classification recognized LGL leukemia as one of four subgroups of chronic T cell lymphoid leukemias and, in 1993, it was proposed that LGL leukemias could be classified into T cell and natural killer (NK) cell types, depending upon the cell lineage of the leukemic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The revised European-American classification of lymphoid neoplasms (REAL) categorized LGL leukemia as a distinct entity classified under peripheral T cell and NK cell neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of mature T and NK cell neoplasms continues to distinguish T cell LGL leukemia (T-LGL leukemia) from aggressive NK cell leukemia based on their unique molecular and clinical features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A provisional entity of chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK cells (also known as chronic NK cell lymphocytosis) distinguishes it from much more aggressive NK cell leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>As described above, the natural killer (NK) cell is associated with a <span class=\"nowrap\">CD3-/CD56+</span> phenotype. About 15 percent of patients with LGL proliferation have this phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These patients can be subclassified into two categories: chronic NK cell lymphocytosis and NK cell LGL leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC NK CELL LYMPHOCYTOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology and pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral infections have been implicated in the pathogenesis of NK lymphocytosis. In a series of 18 patients from Italy, there was evidence for viral infection in 13 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. We did not find any evidence of Epstein-Barr virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and no evidence of human T cell lymphotropic virus <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> was detected in a French series of 27 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, sera from patients with chronic NK lymphocytosis react to an envelope protein of HTLV <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span>. Using an epitope mapping technique, seroreactivity was detected at the specific BA21 epitope of this transmembrane envelope protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. It has therefore been hypothesized that a cellular or retroviral protein having homology to the BA21 epitope may be important in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Similar findings have been noted in T cell LGL leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>It is not clear whether chronic NK lymphocytosis represents a benign disorder or a chronic phase of NK cell LGL leukemia. Follow-up studies in patients with chronic NK lymphocytosis occasionally demonstrate clonal progression via the presence of new chromosomal abnormalities during a transformation into a more acute NK cell LGL leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>We and others have found skewed NK receptor expression on NK cells in patients with the natural killer (NK) type of lymphoproliferative disease of granular lymphocytes, with an increased activating-to-inhibitory killer-cell Ig-like inhibitory receptor (KIR) ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This altered ratio might induce inappropriate lysis or cytokine production and affect disease pathogenesis.</p><p>We have also found evidence of constitutive activation of the <span class=\"nowrap\">Ras/MEK/ERK</span> pathway in 13 of 13 patients with NK cell lymphoproliferative disease of large granular lymphocytes (12 with chronic and 1 with aggressive disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Exposure of these cells to inhibitors of MEK or Ras resulted in apoptosis of patient NK cells, suggesting the use of inhibitors of this pathway in the treatment of these disorders. Activating mutations in STAT 3 occur in approximately 30 percent of these patients, similar to that observed in the T cell form of LGL leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This observation suggests a unifying pathogenesis for these disorders.</p><p>A Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) approved phase II trial of the farnesyltransferase inhibitor (Zarnestra) for both T cell and NK cell LGL leukemia enrolled eight patients on study. Objective responses in hematologic parameters were not observed; however, improvement in pulmonary hypertension was seen in one patient with chronic NK cell lymphocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features and prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 5 percent of all patients with LGL expansion have chronic NK cell lymphocytosis.

The median age is 60 years with a male to female ratio of 3.2. It is a chronic disease with a median duration of five years; no deaths were reported in a series of 10 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Affected patients do not have lymphadenopathy; splenomegaly and hepatomegaly are rare. Vasculitis, including acute glomerulonephritis, urticarial vasculitis, and cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa, has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Pure red cell aplasia, aplastic anemia, and mild thrombocytopenia have also been observed.</p><p>In our experience, when compared with T cell LGL, patients with NK lymphoproliferations are significantly less symptomatic and the association with rheumatoid arthritis is more rarely observed.

Using the monoclonal antibodies EB6 and GL183, it is possible to distinguish four subsets of normal NK cells. Most patients with NK cell lymphocytosis have a restricted NK phenotype, with the NK expansion representing one of these four subsets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic NK cell lymphocytosis is suspected in a patient with clinically indolent disease and persistent peripheral blood lymphocytosis, in whom LGLs are seen on examination of the peripheral blood smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69027\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69027 \">picture 1</a>).

If lymphocytosis is persistent, then flow cytometry should be performed to determine the phenotype of the circulating lymphocytes.

LGLs arise from a T cell or NK cell lineage. Increased levels of circulating LGLs can be benign (nonclonal, secondary to other disorders) or malignant (clonal). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'The large granular lymphocyte'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The current classification of mature T and NK cell neoplasms distinguishes T cell LGL leukemia from aggressive NK cell leukemia based on their unique molecular and clinical features. Chronic NK cell lymphocytosis is a provisional entity distinguished from the much more aggressive NK cell leukemia. It is not clear whether chronic NK cell lymphocytosis represents a benign disorder or a chronic phase of NK cell LGL leukemia. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Classification of LGL disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic NK cell lymphocytosis is suspected in a patient with clinically indolent disease and persistent peripheral blood lymphocytosis, in whom LGLs are seen on examination of the peripheral blood smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69027\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69027 \">picture 1</a>).

Treatment is reserved for patients with symptoms due to neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia, and for patients with associated autoimmune conditions requiring therapy. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no agreed upon standard treatment regimen for symptomatic chronic NK cell lymphocytosis, but there is general agreement that immunosuppressive therapy, such as that administered for T cell LGL leukemia, is reasonable. A choice among immunosuppressive treatments is primarily made based upon the clinical setting and physician experience.
