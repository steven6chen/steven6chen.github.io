An extremely high morbidity, relatively low quality of life (due in part to a high level of dependence and unemployment), and high cost of care have also been observed.</p><p>Instituting more intensive dialysis regimens appears to improve morbidity and possible mortality in this patient population. Compared with conventional, three times per week regimens, for example, dialysis associated with longer duration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> higher frequency correlates with enhanced outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. However, the Hemodialysis (HEMO) study found that increasing the dialysis dose within the general restrictions of a thrice-weekly regimen failed to decrease patient mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival and maintenance dialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Given these findings, nocturnal hemodialysis (eg, long nightly home hemodialysis) was introduced as a (possibly) more desirable alternative to conventional dialysis since it provides superior dialysis, based upon dose, duration, and frequency. This can be accomplished because it is performed during nightly sleep, an otherwise unproductive time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Although Shaldon is credited for overnight dialysis at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], Uldall started the first quotidian (daily) nocturnal hemodialysis program in 1994 in Toronto [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. Since then, its use has been extended to more centers in Canada, the United States, Australia, and several European countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>].</p><p>A description of nocturnal hemodialysis, particularly the exact regimen associated with the procedure, will be presented here. Outcomes associated with nocturnal hemodialysis and an overview of short daily hemodialysis are presented separately.

When it is done at home, the frequency of dialysis varies from three to seven nights per week. Facility-based nocturnal hemodialysis is performed three nights per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Required personnel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Facility-based dialysis is usually performed by the facility staff. Home dialysis is performed by the patient or a helper (unpaid or paid). A partner is <strong>NOT</strong> absolutely required for nocturnal dialysis at home, since this procedure is associated with significant hemodynamic stability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nocturnal hemodialysis is performed during sleep for a variable amount of time (usually 6 to &gt;10 hours), depending upon the length of sleep desired. For facility-based dialysis, the duration of the dialysis session is generally also dictated by facility logistics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Dialysate composition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical composition of the dialysate is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sodium &ndash; 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potassium &ndash; 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bicarbonate &ndash; 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> for nightly regimen and 35 mEq for every other night or thrice-weekly regimens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcium &ndash; 2.5 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (1.25 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> with an average of 3.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. The dialysate calcium concentration is adjusted to keep parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in the desirable range while maintaining normal predialysis calcium concentrations. This may require the postdialysis serum calcium to be often in the hypercalcemic range. The dialysate calcium concentration can be adjusted by varying the amount of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium chloride</a> powder added to the dialysate by the patient (eg, 7 mL of calcium chloride powder added to 4 L of acid dialysate concentrate increases calcium concentration by approximately 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A higher dialysate calcium is prescribed in patients with high ultrafiltration volumes (see below). Such patients are more likely to be in negative calcium balance since the ultrafiltrate contains ionized calcium; thus, the larger the volume removed, the more calcium is lost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Pregnancy or hungry bone syndrome also requires higher levels of dialysate calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hungry bone syndrome following parathyroidectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phosphate &ndash; 0 to 4.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> typically 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phosphate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sodium phosphate</a> (in the form of Fleet enema) is added, if needed, into the acid or bicarbonate concentrate. The dialysate phosphate concentration is adjusted to maintain pre- and postdialysis phosphate concentrations within the normal range. The typical dose of Fleet enema is 30 to 60 mL per dialysate concentrate jug, but amounts as high as 200 mL can be used as a source of phosphate for those with higher requirements, such as pregnant patients or those with hungry bone syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Calcium and phosphate do not precipitate in the presence of the acidic pH of the acid concentrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Patients on intermittent nocturnal hemodialysis are less likely to need phosphate additive.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood and dialysate flow rates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since blood flow as low as or below 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> is adequate for most patients undergoing nocturnal hemodialysis, a poorly functioning dialysis catheter and a single-needle system (when using a fistula or graft) can provide adequate flow. A single-needle system provides extra safety as accidental disconnection can trigger an air detector alarm. A typical blood flow is 200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. Lower flows can be used in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], although higher flows can be used as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The dialysate flow rate is also variable. This can range from 100 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>.</p><p>A typical regimen is a blood flow rate of 200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> and a dialysate flow rate of 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrafiltration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical volume of ultrafiltrate removed per day is approximately 1 to 2 liters, but larger volumes are well tolerated. Patients weigh themselves daily to maintain dry weight, which is defined as normotension without the need for antihypertensive medications or edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Dialyzer membrane and hemodialysis machine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any dialyzer membrane can be used, including smaller surface area dialyzers. Although there are no published data, most centers use high-flux dialyzers. In addition, nocturnal hemodialysis can be performed with any hemodialysis machine. Existing machines have been modified and new machines have been designed for use at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/25-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-31</a>]. In the case of the NxStage machine, the usual dialysate volume is 20 to 25 L [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], although up to 60 L can be provided by the Pureflow water system (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-daily-home-hemodialysis-the-low-dialysate-volume-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short daily home hemodialysis: The low dialysate volume approach&quot;</a>). Using lower dialysate volume for longer dialysis may not increase the removal of small molecules, but phosphate and large molecule removal increases. Higher dialysate volume enhances small-molecule clearance. Attractive attributes of a home dialysis machine include ease of operation, low noise, easily accessible screen that dims at night, back-up battery to protect from power failure, easy disinfection process, and easy single-needle system use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Dialyzer reuse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delayed dialyzer reprocessing has been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Some dialysis machines used in situ dialyzer reprocessing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Most of the centers use new dialyzers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To maintain systemic anticoagulation, the standard heparin regimen is the administration of approximately 1000 units of heparin per hour. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danaparoid-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Danaparoid</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=argatroban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">argatroban</a> have also been used successfully in the case of heparin allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A single dose of low-molecular-weight heparin at the beginning of dialysis has been successfully used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both central venous catheters and peripheral vascular accesses have been successfully used for nocturnal hemodialysis. When peripheral accesses are used, however, more frequent access cannulation may result in decreased access survival. This was suggested by the Frequent Hemodialysis Network (FHN) Daily and Nocturnal trials, in which the primary vascular outcome was time to first access event (including repair, loss of access, or access-related hospitalization), and the secondary vascular outcome was the time to all repairs and time to all losses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>In the FHN Nocturnal trial, 87 participants were randomly assigned to receive in-center, six days per week hemodialysis or conventional, three days per week hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Compared with conventional dialysis, there was a nonsignificant trend toward a higher rate of first access events associated with nocturnal dialysis (32 versus 58 events per 100 patient years, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 1.81, 95% CI 0.94-3.48). When patients with a tunneled catheter were excluded from the analysis, nocturnal dialysis was associated with a significantly increased risk of a first access event (HR 3.23, 95% CI 1.07-10.34). In the FHN Daily trial (n = 245 participants), there was a higher incidence of a first access event in the daily group compared with the conventional group. The FHN Daily trial is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-daily-hemodialysis#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short daily hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Vascular access'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Catheters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any type of central venous catheter can be used for nocturnal hemodialysis. The capability of the catheter to provide blood flow &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> is not important for most patients. A safe connection for the central catheter includes the use of pre-perforated catheter caps, which are not removed during dialysis. The InterLink, the TEGO, and the Swan-Lock systems have been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/11,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,37,38</a>]. Careful taping of the catheter-tubing connection is of paramount importance. Accidental disconnection of the venous limb can cause exsanguination without triggering machine alarms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541554937\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombosis &ndash; The local instillation of 2 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> (tissue-type plasminogen activator [tPA]) has been very successful in restoring adequate blood flow in thrombosed catheters (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access#H79683300\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central catheters for acute and chronic hemodialysis access&quot;, section on 'Catheter malfunction'</a>). The instillation of lyophilized tPA has been practiced successfully by patients at home.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The approach to the prevention of catheter thrombosis is variable in different centers. The prophylactic use of tPA has been advocated to prevent catheter thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Some patients in our center use a small dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> to prevent catheter thrombosis. The initial dose is usually 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. For patients with recurrent thrombosis, the warfarin dose is increased by 1 mg until patency is maintained, providing the international normalized ratio (INR) remains below the levels that the clinician considers safe (usually INR &lt;2). [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/11,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,40</a>]. A prospective randomized, controlled study did not find the use of low-dose warfarin useful in preventing catheter dysfunction, however [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The risk of bleeding, vascular calcification related to the use of warfarin, and the negative trial cited should be considered for individual patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection &ndash; The incidence of catheter-induced bacteremias with nocturnal hemodialysis is relatively low (approximately 0.35 to 1.5 per 1000 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. At our center, patients with fever and chills during the initiation of dialysis, but without severe symptoms such as hypotension, usually draw blood cultures at home and begin empiric treatment with intravenous antibiotics (usually 1 g of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> and 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a>, if they have previously tolerated such agents). The treatment is subsequently modified based upon culture results and continues for two weeks. If appropriate based upon culture results, continuation of treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> rather than vancomycin is encouraged. If the infection recurs (in our experience, usually one month later), the catheter is replaced over a guidewire after restarting or continuing antibiotic coverage. A different site should be chosen if an exit site is present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many bacteremias resolve successfully with antibiotics. We immediately remove the catheter with severe sepsis, especially if associated with hemodynamic instability or suspicion of metastatic infection. The infection rate and survival of the catheters on nocturnal hemodialysis may be better than conventional hemodialysis, but data from randomized controlled studies are absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/37,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This approach differs somewhat from that presented elsewhere relating to the management of conventionally dialyzed patients with possibly infected hemodialysis catheters. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tunneled, cuffed hemodialysis catheter-related bacteremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One review of 98 patients performing nocturnal hemodialysis using catheters found that 64.4 percent of patients developed bacteremia, with a rate of 1.12 episodes per 1000 days over a study period of 6.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The most common organism was <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis</em> (51.4 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Arteriovenous fistulas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An arteriovenous fistula is the access of choice. The standard steel needles, blunt needles, and plastic cannulas have been used successfully. The buttonhole technique, which involves the insertion of the <span class=\"nowrap\">needle/cannula</span> through exactly the same hole and at the same angle and depth of penetration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>], is used by most patients. After 8 to 10 cannulations (or 12 to 14 in diabetic patients) using the buttonhole method, an epithelialized track develops that allows the use of blunt needles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Sharp needles should be used for the first week, followed by &quot;blunt&quot; needles thereafter. Before cannulation, the fistula and surrounding skin are cleansed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> gluconate (0.5% in 70% alcohol) or povidone-iodine solution. Scabs are covered with an alcohol pad for five minutes and then removed using a sterile needle. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mupirocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mupirocin</a> calcium 2% cream (Bactroban) is applied to each buttonhole with a sterile cotton swab after hemostasis is achieved and allowed to air dry. A single application is provided for each hemodialysis procedure. Mupirocin prophylaxis appears to significantly lower the risk of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> bacteremia with buttonhole cannulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Buttonhole cannulation without the use of local <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mupirocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mupirocin</a> can be associated with <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia, often leading to life-threatening metastatic infections. The risk of infection was examined in the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial compared 140 conventional hemodialysis patients assigned to either the buttonhole technique or to conventional &quot;rope-ladder&quot; needling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. At eight weeks, the rate of localized infection was higher among patients assigned to the buttonhole technique compared with conventional needling (50 versus 22.4 per 1000, respectively). There was one episode of <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia at eight weeks and two more episodes after the study ended but within 12 months in the group utilizing the buttonhole technique versus none in the conventional needling group. At 12 months, the number of needling site abscesses requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics was higher in the buttonhole group versus the conventional needling group (nine versus zero, respectively). The degree to which these data from conventional hemodialysis patients may be extrapolated to nocturnal daily hemodialysis or self-cannulating patients is not clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Over 3765 arteriovenous fistula-months, there were 17 systemic infections attributed to fistula infections. Compared with rope-ladder cannulation, the buttonhole technique was associated with a higher rate of total fistula infections (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 3.85, 95% CI 1.66-12.77) but not systemic infections. Loss of the fistula or requirement for surgical intervention was not different between the groups, although interventions by radiology were not included in the analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An accompanying systematic review also found an increased risk of infections associated with buttonhole technique compared with other techniques in four randomized trials (relative risk [RR] 3.34, 95% CI 0.91-12.20), as well as in observational studies.</p><p/><p>As a result of the increased risk of infection, avoidance of buttonhole cannulation has been advocated by some experts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>]. We have not seen any case of <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia in our center since the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mupirocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mupirocin</a> use started a number of years ago. Most centers do not practice the buttonhole technique for facility-based dialysis.</p><p>The buttonhole technique may be associated with fewer thrombotic complications among patients undergoing nocturnal or daily dialysis.

This benefit was driven mostly by a reduction in thrombotic episodes. The buttonhole technique may also improve fistula survival among patients undergoing conventional hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

The buttonhole technique is not practiced with these accesses. A different hole is used with every dialysis, following the conventional technique. Steel needles or plastic cannulas can be used. Preference should be given to the single-needle technique to minimize the number of punctures. The single-needle system provides adequate blood flow (average 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min),</span> while providing extra safety in case of accidental disconnection by triggering an air detection alarm. Thus, it may be the access system of choice for nocturnal hemodialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14090534\"><span class=\"h1\">SAFETY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Home hemodialysis is generally considered to be safe, providing patients are carefully selected and well trained and safety measures are observed. In one report from two adult home hemodialysis programs in Canada, there was one death and six potentially fatal events among 190 patients and approximately 500 patient-years of treatment; six of the seven events involved bleeding, and five of seven involved a human error with a lapse in established protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>To ensure the safety of the procedure, adequate taping of the needle and anchoring of the blood tubing are essential; enuresis pads wrapped around the connection are also considered essential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Blood leaks trigger an audible alarm. Dedicated disposable leak sensors are available (RedSense Medical AB), as well as nondisposable wireless leak sensors that stop the blood pump when triggered (Fresenius Medical Care). Two inexpensive moisture sensors are placed strategically on the floor to detect dialysate and blood leaks.</p><p>As noted above, a single-needle system provides extra safety in case of accidental disconnection by triggering an air detection alarm. (See <a href=\"#H14090545\" class=\"local\">'Arteriovenous grafts'</a> above.)</p><p>Some centers practice live remote monitoring of patients at home via either regular telephone lines or the internet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>]. All the information available on the dialysis machine, including conditions that trigger alarms, is available to an observer at the center. The patient who is not awakened by the alarm is called.</p><p>Live monitoring provides the following benefits:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Helps prevent blood from clotting in an idle extracorporeal system</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provides reassurance to the patient</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ensures compliance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aids the collection of data</p><p/><p>Despite these benefits, such monitoring has not yet detected life-threatening conditions. Thus, its use should be considered optional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Most centers do not practice remote monitoring of patients on nocturnal hemodialysis, although some centers use remote monitoring for selected patients or for short periods of time (three months).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION AND TRAINING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients capable of performing home hemodialysis or those with home helpers are eligible for nocturnal hemodialysis. Exclusion criteria include acute illnesses, uncontrolled seizure activity, labile type 1 diabetes (in the absence of a helper), and a contraindication to systemic anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The presence of older age, an unstable cardiovascular system, hypotension, diabetes mellitus, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ascites are all indications, and not contraindications, for nocturnal hemodialysis. An aid to facilitate the home dialysis choice for patients has been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Patient groups that can be preferentially targeted for nocturnal hemodialysis include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incident patients followed in a chronic kidney disease (CKD) clinic. To prevent the state of dependence frequently encountered in in-center dialysis units, training should be instituted early or patients should be dialyzed temporarily in self-care settings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients ineligible for kidney transplantation. Nocturnal hemodialysis can be viewed as the dialysis modality closest to kidney transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with significant morbidity, including cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, severe hypertension, dialysis-related symptoms, or large intradialytic weight gains.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who require conversion from peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis and who want to maintain independence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large-size patients or patients not adequately dialyzed because of poor access flow.</p><p/><p>The length of training depends upon the patient's previous experience. The typical duration for a previously untrained patient is six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. During the first five weeks, patients are dialyzed on conventional or short daily hemodialysis. Patients may sleep in the training facility while on nocturnal hemodialysis during the last one to three nights, but this is not a universal practice. Training includes drawing blood samples for laboratory tests and blood cultures, as well as self-administering intravenous medications including antibiotics and iron preparations. The practice of self-administration of intravenous iron preparations is variable and, in some jurisdictions, is not practiced out of fear of anaphylactic reactions. Supplies at home include test tubes, a centrifuge, blood culture bottles, antibiotics, and, in selected cases, lyophilized tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA).</p><p>The adoption of nocturnal hemodialysis may be hampered by patient-perceived barriers, including lack of confidence in their ability to perform necessary duties (eg, self-cannulation), fear of a possible catastrophic event, and the reluctance to burden family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Financial barriers can be significant. Costs include increased home utility fees for the patients and low dialysis reimbursement rates, especially when more than thrice-weekly dialysis is planned.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nocturnal hemodialysis can be practiced in the facility (thrice weekly) or at home (three to seven nights per week). Home nocturnal hemodialysis is performed either by the patient or partner (a partner not being absolutely required) during sleep for a variable amount of time, based upon the length of sleep desired (usually 6 to 10 hours in total). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Required personnel'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Time'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with conventional hemodialysis and depending on the frequency, the dialysate contains lower levels of bicarbonate, higher levels of calcium, and often contains phosphate. Typical flow rates are a blood flow rate of 200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> and a dialysate flow rate of 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. The typical volume of ultrafiltrate removed per day is approximately 1 to 2 liters, but higher volumes are well tolerated. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Dialysate composition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Ultrafiltration'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Blood and dialysate flow rates'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To maintain systemic anticoagulation, the standard heparin regimen is the administration of approximately 1000 units of heparin per hour. Central venous catheters, arteriovenous fistulas, and arteriovenous grafts have been successfully used for nocturnal hemodialysis. Safety devices are important to prevent accidental access disconnection and bleeding during sleep. An arteriovenous fistula is the preferred vascular access using a single-needle system. The use of the &quot;buttonhole&quot; technique offers advantages but is associated with a high rate of systemic infections by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. Local application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mupirocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mupirocin</a> cream at the puncture site appears to decrease or eliminate this risk. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Anticoagulation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Access'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some centers practice live remote monitoring of patients at home, either via regular telephone lines or the internet, while others do not practice remote monitoring. Its use should be considered optional. (See <a href=\"#H14090534\" class=\"local\">'Safety'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients capable of performing home hemodialysis are eligible for nocturnal hemodialysis. Exceptions include acute illnesses, uncontrolled seizures, labile type 1 diabetes in the absence of a helper, and contraindication to systemic anticoagulation. Significant comorbidities can be indications rather than contraindications for nocturnal hemodialysis.
