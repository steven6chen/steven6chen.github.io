Chrysotile accounts for over 90 percent of the asbestos in commercial use in the United States and is generally considered less toxic than the amphibole fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asbestos-related-pleuropulmonary-disease/abstract/3,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,7</a>].</p><p>When the use of asbestos was widespread, exposure occurred in a variety of occupational and non-occupational settings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67902\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67902 \">table 1</a>).

In the United States, asbestos use has been limited since the 1970s, but is still permitted in automotive brake pads and gaskets, roofing products, and fireproof clothing. Mining of asbestos is ongoing in several countries, most prominently Russia, China, Brazil, and Kazakhstan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asbestos-related-pleuropulmonary-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Environmental exposure to low levels of asbestos from naturally occurring sources or industrial emissions may increase the risk of malignant mesothelioma, but not asbestosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asbestos-related-pleuropulmonary-disease/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. The health risk to occupants of a building in which asbestos is in good repair and undisturbed (ie, not respirable) is <strong>not</strong> considered significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asbestos-related-pleuropulmonary-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2283837394\"><span class=\"h1\">ASBESTOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asbestosis specifically refers to the slowly progressive, diffuse pulmonary fibrosis caused by inhalation of asbestos fibers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3246595298\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gross anatomic features of asbestosis include the presence of small, stiff lungs with fibrosis in the subpleural regions of the lower lobes. The adjacent visceral pleura may also be fibrotic and associated with parietal pleural plaques, while the central portions of the lung are relatively spared (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66468\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66468 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asbestos-related-pleuropulmonary-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The histopathologic diagnosis of asbestosis requires the presence of uncoated or coated asbestos fibers (asbestos bodies) in association with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis that is similar in appearance to usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61838%7EPULM%2F81274%7EPULM%2F70440%7EPULM%2F59362%7EPULM%2F50185\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61838 graphicRef81274 graphicRef70440 graphicRef59362 graphicRef50185 \">picture 2A-E</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73648\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73648 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asbestos-related-pleuropulmonary-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Pulmonary fibrosis in asbestosis differs from that of UIP in two important ways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asbestos-related-pleuropulmonary-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Fibroblast foci, which are characteristic of UIP, are infrequent in asbestosis. In addition, asbestosis is typically associated with mild fibrosis of the visceral pleural.

Such a coating may surround a number of other mineral particles, such as glass, talc, iron, or carbon; the resulting structures are generically called ferruginous bodies. Asbestos bodies are differentiated from other ferruginous bodies by their transparent core [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asbestos-related-pleuropulmonary-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Light microscopy does not allow accurate determination of the mineral at the core of a ferruginous body, and definitive identification may require scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray analysis of lung specimens. Amphibole fibers form asbestos bodies more readily than do chrysotile fibers, in part due to the less efficient pulmonary clearance of amphiboles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asbestos-related-pleuropulmonary-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Two or more asbestos bodies per square centimeter of a 5-mu thick lung section, in combination with interstitial fibrosis, are indicative of asbestosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asbestos-related-pleuropulmonary-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The quantity of asbestos fibers in the lungs (both coated and uncoated) is generally 10 to 20-fold higher in patients with asbestosis compared with unexposed individuals and correlates with the severity of fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asbestos-related-pleuropulmonary-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Quantification of asbestos bodies by light microscopy significantly underestimates the total lung fiber burden. The number of asbestos bodies in digested lung is generally 10 to 10,000-fold less than the total number of uncoated fibers determined by electron microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asbestos-related-pleuropulmonary-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asbestos-induced diseases are probably caused by the direct toxic effects of the fibers on pulmonary parenchymal cells as well as the release of various mediators (reactive oxygen species, proteases, cytokines, and growth factors) by inflammatory cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asbestos-related-pleuropulmonary-disease/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Deleterious reactive oxygen and nitrogen free radicals may be formed either via reactions catalyzed by iron molecules within asbestos bodies or as a consequence of the activation of inflammatory cells. Free radicals can react with and damage a variety of cellular macromolecules and may disrupt DNA to give rise to malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asbestos-related-pleuropulmonary-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Animal models suggest that inhaled asbestos fibers deposit at respiratory bronchiole and alveolar duct bifurcations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asbestos-related-pleuropulmonary-disease/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. This triggers the accumulation of alveolar macrophages and the development of an inflammatory reaction that extends centrifugally into the terminal respiratory bronchioles and adjacent alveolar interstitium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asbestos-related-pleuropulmonary-disease/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. The majority of fibers are removed from the lungs by mucociliary mechanisms, but some are taken up by alveolar macrophages and alveolar type I cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asbestos-related-pleuropulmonary-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Amphibole fibers may be more toxic than chrysotile because their structure allows them to deposit more efficiently in the distal lung parenchyma and reduces their rate of clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asbestos-related-pleuropulmonary-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Smoking increases the attack <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progression rate of asbestosis, probably by interfering with the mucociliary clearance of inhaled fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asbestos-related-pleuropulmonary-disease/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. </p><p>Over time, there is more diffuse pulmonary involvement characterized by loss of alveolar type I and II cells and expansion of the numbers of alveolar and interstitial macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils.
