Most patients with <em>A. lumbricoides</em> or <em>A. suum</em> infection are asymptomatic. When symptoms do occur, they occur most often during the adult worm intestinal stage (as intestinal, hepatobiliary, or pancreatic manifestations) but may also occur during the larval migration stage (as pulmonary manifestations).</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of ascariasis are reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human acquisition of <em>Ascaris</em> infection can occur via the following mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ingestion of eggs secreted in the feces of humans (<em>A. lumbricoides</em>) or pigs (<em>A. suum)</em>.

The majority of individuals with ascariasis live in Asia (73 percent), Africa (12 percent), and South America (8 percent); some populations have infection rates as high as 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/2,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14</a>]. Ascariasis is most common among children 2 to 10 years of age, and the prevalence of infection diminishes among individuals &gt;15 years of age. Infections tend to cluster in families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The prevalence of <em>A. lumbricoides</em> infection is highest in tropical countries where warm, wet climates favor year-round transmission. In dry areas, transmission occurs predominantly during the rainy months. Emerging evidence suggests that <em>A. lumbricoides</em> prefers acidic soil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Ascariasis occurs most commonly in areas where suboptimal sanitation practices are associated with fecal contamination of soil, water, and food.</p><p>Historically, the highest burden of ascariasis in the United States occurred in the southeast; the prevalence of infection decreased significantly after introduction of modern sanitation and waste treatment in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Infection can occur among travelers to areas with high prevalence of infection.</p><p><em>Ascaris</em> infection due to <em>A. suum</em> has been recognized increasingly in regions where human exposure to pigs enables ingestion of infectious eggs. Pig husbandry and the use of pig feces for fertilizer has been associated with human infection even in temperate regions of developed countries. Pigs are usually infected from eating eggs shed by other pigs but occasionally become infected after ingestion of livers and lungs from chickens infected with <em>Ascaris</em> of pig origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Two cases of pulmonary ascariasis in Austria initially thought to be due to <em>A. lumbricoides</em> were subsequently attributed to <em>A. suum</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. <em>A. suum</em> infections have been reported in China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/12,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,18</a>], the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p>Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has not been associated with increased risk for ascariasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8718740\"><span class=\"h2\">Life cycle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The life cycle of ascariasis is summarized in the Figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79015\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79015 \">figure 1</a>). <em>Ascaris</em> eggs passed in stool are deposited in soil, where they embryonate and become infective within two to four weeks. After oral ingestion of infective <em>Ascaris</em> eggs (via contaminated food or water), the eggs hatch in the small intestine within four days and release larvae that migrate through the mucosa of the cecum and proximal colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F90387\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90387 \">picture 1</a>). Subsequently, the larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and migrate hematogenously or via lymphatics to the liver and then the lungs. Larvae mature within the alveoli over 10 to 14 days, ascend the bronchial tree, and are swallowed. Occasionally, larvae migrate to other sites such as the brain or kidneys.</p><p>Once back in the intestine, larvae mature into adult worms (females 20 to 35 cm; males 15 to 30 cm) in the lumen of the small intestine. The majority of worms are found in the jejunum, though worms may be found anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract and occasionally migrate to other ectopic sites. Adult worms begin to lay eggs about 9 to 11 weeks following infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. When both female and male worms are present in the intestine, each female worm produces approximately 200,000 fertilized eggs per day. In the setting of infection with only female worms, infertile eggs are produced that do not develop into the infectious stage. In the setting of infection with only male worms, no eggs are formed.</p><p>Adult worms do not multiply in the human host; the number of adult worms in an infected individual depends on the degree of exposure to infectious eggs over time. Adult worms have a lifespan of 10 to 24 months and are passed in the stool. In highly endemic areas, worm burdens of several hundred per individual may be observed; there are case reports of more than 2000 worms in individual children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The number of eggs produced per female worm tends to decrease as the worm burden increases.</p><p>The eggs are passed in stool; they are oval, have a thick shell and mamillated outer coat, and measure 45 to 70 microns by 35 to 50 microns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76433\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76433 \">picture 2</a>). Unfertilized eggs are not infective; fertile eggs embryonate and become infective after 18 days to several weeks. In favorable environmental conditions (moist, warm, shaded soil), eggs can survive for up to 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The eggs are resistant to chemical water purification but may be eliminated by filtration or boiling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transmission of ascariasis occurs primarily via ingestion of water or food contaminated with infectious <em>A. lumbricoides</em> or <em>A. suum</em> eggs. Children playing in contaminated soil may acquire the parasite from their hands, and poor hygiene facilitates spread of infection. Uncommonly, transmission occurs via airborne ingestion of contaminated dust. Maternal-fetal transmission via transplacental migration of larvae has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Transmission of infection is enhanced by asymptomatically infected individuals who can continue to shed eggs for years. Reinfection occurring in endemic areas is common. Prior infection does not confer protective immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, coinfection with other parasitic diseases is common given similar predisposing factors for transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Transmission of <em>A. suum</em> is associated with pig husbandry and use of pig feces as fertilizer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4014781289\"><span class=\"h1\">ASYMPTOMATIC INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with <em>A. lumbricoides</em> or <em>A. suum</em> infection are asymptomatic.</p><p>All patients with <em>Ascaris</em> infection warrant anthelminthic treatment, even those with asymptomatic infection. In endemic areas, mass treatment programs are effective. Outside endemic areas, screening or administration of presumptive therapy for empiric treatment is appropriate for adult immigrants and refugees from areas where the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths is high.</p><p>These issues are discussed further separately.

Nonetheless, the global burden of symptomatic disease is relatively high because of the high prevalence of disease. In general, clinical symptoms occur among individuals with relatively high worm loads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>When symptoms do occur, they occur most often during the late-phase adult worm intestinal stage (as intestinal, hepatobiliary, or pancreatic manifestations) but may also occur during the early-phase larval migration stage (as pulmonary manifestations).

Symptomatic pulmonary involvement is rare among individuals in highly endemic areas with ongoing exposure, even among young children who can develop very heavy infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. One study in Colombia (where intestinal <em>Ascaris</em> infection rates range from 25 to 90 percent) noted only four cases of Loeffler syndrome among about 13,000 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The eosinophil-enriched pulmonary inflammation associated with pulmonary <em>Ascaris</em> infection in previously unexposed individuals may be analogous to the eosinophilic inflammatory response that characterizes the immune response of individuals with no prior exposure to <em>Loa loa</em> or schistosomiasis (Katayama fever). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loiasis-loa-loa-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Loiasis (Loa loa infection)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-schistosomiasis#H6283799\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of schistosomiasis&quot;, section on 'Acute schistosomiasis syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1464847476\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical manifestations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1108088292\"><span class=\"h4\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the early phase of infection (4 to 16 days following egg ingestion), migration of <em>Ascaris </em>larvae through the lungs may be associated with transient respiratory symptoms and eosinophilic pneumonitis. In general, respiratory manifestations occur primarily in the larval stage of infection; they rarely complicate the intestinal phase. Rarely, aspiration pneumonia can occur in association with migration of adult worms up the esophagus and into the trachea in association with vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Pulmonary involvement associated with parasitic infection is known as Loeffler syndrome (Loffler syndrome); the initial description of the syndrome consisted of eosinophilic pneumonitis later attributed by Loeffler to <em>A. lumbricoides</em> infection. Other parasitic infections associated with pulmonary syndromes include <em>Strongyloides</em>, hookworm (<em>Ancylostoma duodenale</em>, <em>Necator americanus</em>, and <em>Toxocara</em>), schistosomiasis, and lymphatic filariasis associated with tropical pulmonary eosinophilia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-pulmonary-eosinophilia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of pulmonary eosinophilia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pulmonary manifestations associated with migration of <em>Ascaris</em> larvae include dry cough, dyspnea, fever, wheezing, substernal discomfort, and blood-tinged sputum. Over half of patients have crackles and wheezing in the absence of focal consolidation. Urticaria occurs during the first five days of illness in about 15 percent of cases. Hepatomegaly may develop. Lymphadenopathy is generally not observed. Symptoms generally subside within 5 to 10 days; the syndrome is usually self-limited and very rarely fatal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1145709768\"><span class=\"h4\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peripheral eosinophilia may be observed in association with pulmonary manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Eosinophilia may be absent in the early symptomatic period but increase in magnitude after several days of symptoms; it resolves over many weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Eosinophil levels are usually 5 to 12 percent but can be as high as 30 to 50 percent. Eosinophilia is masked by administration of steroids.</p><p>Sputum analysis may demonstrate eosinophils and Charcot-Leyden crystals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71997\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71997 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. These crystals are also observed in other eosinophilic parasitic lung infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-pulmonary-eosinophilia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of pulmonary eosinophilia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Serum levels of total immunoglobulin (Ig)G and total IgE are often elevated during early infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4287429417\"><span class=\"h4\">Imaging findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chest radiography may demonstrate round or oval infiltrates ranging in size from several millimeters to several centimeters in both lung fields. These findings are more likely to be present when blood eosinophilia exceeds 10 percent. The infiltrates are migratory and may become confluent in perihilar areas; they usually clear after several weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F108282\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108282 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/11,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,32</a>].</p><p>Computed tomography imaging generally demonstrates multiple nodules (generally up to 3 cm diameter); these are most commonly peripherally based and often have a halo of ground-glass attenuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/12,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,33,34</a>]. Ground-glass opacities with ill-defined margins may also be seen. On serial imaging, these nodules are migratory.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3834780289\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary ascariasis should be suspected particularly in individuals with no prior <em>Ascaris</em> exposure and potential egg ingestion within weeks prior to onset of respiratory symptoms (dry cough, dyspnea, fever, wheezing), characteristic radiographic findings (migratory bilateral round infiltrates), peripheral eosinophilia, and relevant epidemiologic exposure to eggs of <em>A. lumbricoides</em> or <em>A. suum</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/11,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,29</a>]. The diagnosis may be definitively established via visualization of <em>Ascaris</em> larvae in respiratory secretions or gastric aspirates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F90387\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90387 \">picture 1</a>), although this is rarely possible. Symptomatic pulmonary involvement is rare among individuals in highly endemic areas with ongoing exposure. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Stool examination is not useful for diagnosis of pulmonary infection, since eggs are generally detected in the stool at least 40 days following pulmonary symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79015\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79015 \">figure 1</a>). A positive stool examination for <em>Ascaris</em> eggs at the time of respiratory symptoms does not establish a causal diagnosis of pulmonary ascariasis, since these eggs reflect infection acquired 2 to 12 months earlier. (See <a href=\"#H8718740\" class=\"local\">'Life cycle'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3642280323\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of pulmonary manifestations associated with ascariasis consists of supportive care. Symptomatic alleviation of wheeze and cough may be managed with inhaled bronchodilators.</p><p>In the setting of severe pneumonitis, systemic corticosteroids may be administered, so long as <em>Strongyloides</em> infection has been ruled out via examination of sputum and stool for <em>Strongyloides</em> larvae. This is because administration of corticosteroids in the setting of <em>Strongyloides</em> infection can induce <em>Strongyloides</em> hyperinfection syndrome (which can be associated multiorgan system dysfunction and septic shock) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Detection of <em>Strongyloides</em> larvae should prompt management as discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=strongyloidiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Strongyloidiasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Anthelminthic therapy is generally not administered during the pulmonary phase since the efficacy of drugs against larvae in the lungs is uncertain. Rather, follow-up should be performed approximately two months after symptoms have resolved; at this time, evaluation should include a stool examination for helminth eggs as well as <em>Strongyloides</em> serologic testing. Treatment should then be administered accordingly for intestinal infection(s) identified.

In one meta-analysis, intestinal obstruction accounted for 38 to 87 percent of all complications of ascariasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Another report noted that individuals presenting with intestinal obstruction associated with ascariasis had an estimated burden of &gt;60 intestinal worms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In some regions, ascariasis is the most common cause of acute abdominal surgical emergencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], and, in endemic areas, 5 to 35 percent of all bowel obstructions are due to ascariasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Approximately 85 percent of obstructions due to ascariasis occur in children between one and five years of age. The overall incidence of obstruction associated with ascariasis in children is approximately 1 in 500.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Obstruction occurs most commonly at the ileocecal valve. Migrating adult worms can also obstruct the appendix, resulting in appendicitis. Symptoms of intestinal obstruction associated with ascariasis include colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. Emesis may contain worms. In some cases, an abdominal mass that changes in size and location may be appreciated on serial physical examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other complications associated with <em>A. lumbricoides</em> intestinal obstruction include volvulus, ileocecal intussusception, gangrene, and intestinal perforation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malnutrition &ndash; Ascariasis has been associated with malnutrition, growth retardation, and impaired cognitive development in school children. A high burden of infection can lead to impaired absorption of dietary proteins, lactose, and vitamins A and C; steatorrhea may occur. Children treated for ascariasis reportedly have better nutritional status in terms of growth, lactose tolerance, vitamins A and C, and albumin levels than children with untreated ascariasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, it is difficult to discern the true effect of ascariasis on nutritional status given other coexisting nutritional deficiencies in infected children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatobiliary and pancreatic involvement &ndash; Migration of adult <em>Ascaris</em> worms into the biliary tree can cause biliary colic, biliary strictures, acalculous cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis, obstructive jaundice, liver abscesses, and bile duct perforation with peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. Retained worm fragments can serve as a nidus for biliary stones. Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, caused by stone formation around dead <em>A</em>. <em>lumbricoides</em> in the bile duct, also occurs. Adult <em>Ascaris</em> worms may also obstruct the pancreatic duct, leading to pancreatitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ascariasis has been associated with up to one-third of biliary and pancreatic disease in India [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. In one study, hepatobiliary and pancreatic ascariasis was the etiological factor for biliary disease, acute pancreatitis, liver abscess, and biliary lithiasis in 37, 23, 15, and 13 percent of cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascariasis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

In addition, the prevalence is high in areas where suboptimal sanitation practices lead to increased contamination of soil, water, and food. <em>Ascaris suum</em> is an intestinal parasite of pigs that is closely related to <em>A. lumbricoides</em>.

After oral ingestion of eggs (via contaminated food or water), the eggs hatch in the small intestine and release larvae that migrate hematogenously to the lungs. In the alveoli, the larvae mature over a period of approximately 10 days then ascend the bronchial tree and are swallowed. Once back in the intestine, they mature into adult worms (females 20 to 35 cm; males 15 to 30 cm) that inhabit the lumen of the small intestine, usually in the jejunum or ileum. When both female and male worms are present in the intestine, female worms produce fertilized eggs that pass into the stool. The eggs prefer warm, shady, moist conditions under which they can survive for up to 10 years.

(See <a href=\"#H4014781289\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When symptoms do occur, they occur most often during the late-phase adult worm intestinal stage (as intestinal obstruction [most common] or hepatobiliary or pancreatic manifestations) but may also occur during the early-phase larval migration stage (as pulmonary manifestations).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>During the early phase of infection (4 to 16 days following egg ingestion), migration of <em>Ascaris </em>larvae through the lungs may be associated with transient respiratory symptoms and eosinophilic pneumonitis. (See <a href=\"#H3020874537\" class=\"local\">'Early phase: Pulmonary manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>During the late phase of infection (6 to 8 weeks after egg ingestion), symptoms of ascariasis may consist of nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Complications of ascariasis may include obstruction of the intestine, biliary, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pancreatic duct. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Late phase: Intestinal manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary ascariasis should be suspected in individuals with no prior <em>Ascaris</em> exposure and potential egg ingestion within weeks prior to onset of respiratory symptoms (dry cough, dyspnea, fever, wheezing), characteristic radiographic findings (migratory bilateral round infiltrates), and peripheral eosinophilia. Symptomatic pulmonary involvement is rare among individuals in highly endemic areas with ongoing exposure. The diagnosis may be definitively established via visualization of <em>Ascaris</em> larvae in respiratory secretions or gastric aspirates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F90387\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90387 \">picture 1</a>), although this is rarely possible. Stool examination is not useful for diagnosis of pulmonary infection, since eggs are generally detected in the stool at least 40 days following pulmonary symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H3834780289\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of pulmonary ascariasis consists of supportive care. Symptomatic alleviation of wheeze and cough may be managed with inhaled bronchodilators. Anthelminthic therapy is generally not administered at the time of pulmonary symptoms since the efficacy of drugs against larvae in the lungs is uncertain. Rather, anthelminthic for intestinal ascariasis should be administered following resolution of pulmonary manifestations, once adult worms have developed to maturity in the small intestine. (See <a href=\"#H3642280323\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intestinal ascariasis should be suspected in patients with nonspecific abdominal symptoms (discomfort, anorexia, nausea, or vomiting) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> associated complications (biliary or pancreatic involvement) in association with relevant epidemiologic exposure in an area with high prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths. The diagnosis is established via stool microscopy for ova (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76433\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76433 \">picture 2</a>) or via examination of adult worms. (See <a href=\"#H2897459474\" class=\"local\">'Clinical approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Ova and parasite examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of intestinal ascariasis and associated complications consists of anthelminthic therapy. We recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albendazole</a> (400 mg orally once) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mebendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mebendazole</a> (500 mg orally single dose or 100 mg orally twice daily for three days) for treatment of ascariasis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). For treatment of pregnant women, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrantel-pamoate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyrantel pamoate</a> (11 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> as a single dose up to a maximum of 1 g) should be used. In some cases, surgical or endoscopic intervention is also warranted. (See <a href=\"#H2442323937\" class=\"local\">'Clinical approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3870780922\" class=\"local\">'Anthelminthic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In regions where <em>Ascaris</em> worms are abundant in soil, prevention of reinfection is extremely difficult. Strategies for the control include improvements in sanitation, health education, and mass anthelminthic treatment. Sanitation measures associated with lower rates of helminth infection include use of treated water, availability of soap, and handwashing after defecation. Issues related to mass drug administration for control of parasitic infections are discussed separately.
