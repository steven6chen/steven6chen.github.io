In patients with ruptured aneurysms, systemic hypertension may be a normal hemodynamic response, which maintains cerebral perfusion in the setting of increased ICP. Our usual approach to BP management during induction and maintenance of anesthesia in these patients is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Unruptured aneurysms and ruptured aneurysms with suspected normal ICP (ie, normal neurologic examination)</strong> &ndash; Aim for systolic BP &le; the patient's normal systolic BP, maximum 140 mmHg, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) &ge;60 mmHg.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ruptured aneurysms with suspected or known intracranial hypertension</strong> &ndash; Passive hypertension should not be treated. Hypertension in response to noxious stimulation and iatrogenic hypertension due to vasopressors should be avoided. If an ICP monitor is in place, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) &ge;50 to 60 mmHg should be maintained.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H854385389\"><span class=\"h3\">Premedication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anxiolytic premedication (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> 1 to 2 mg IV, titrated to effect) is usually appropriate for elective aneurysm procedures. Premedication for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage should be tailored to the patient's mental status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1355849161\"><span class=\"h3\">Induction of anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IV induction of anesthesia is usually performed for adult patients. The goal for induction for these procedures is to maintain <strong>hemodynamic stability</strong>. Drugs and doses should be selected to avoid hypertension and the risk of aneurysm rupture, while avoiding hypotension, to maintain cerebral perfusion.</p><p>The choice of induction agents, adjuvant drugs for induction, and airway management strategies are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-craniotomy#H8564106\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for craniotomy&quot;, section on 'Induction of anesthesia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-induction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Induction&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3295081700\"><span class=\"h3\">Maintenance of anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of anesthetic regimens may be used for craniotomy for aneurysm surgery, depending on the degree of preexisting intracranial hypertension, the need for brain relaxation during surgery, the use of neuromonitoring, and the patient's medical issues. In the authors' institution, where neuromonitoring is routinely used for these procedures, the usual anesthetic includes a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> infusion along with volatile anesthetics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia#H1127571\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromonitoring in surgery and anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Balanced anesthetic approach'</a>.) </p><p>Maintenance of anesthesia for craniotomy is discussed in detail separately. Concerns specific to aneurysm surgery are discussed here.

Goals for anesthetic management and BP control for various stages of aneurysm surgery are as follows:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1076398984\"><span class=\"h5\">Skull pinning and incision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skull pinning is a brief, sudden, painful stimulus comparable to incision or laryngoscopy that can result in hypertension and tachycardia. Various strategies may be used to prevent a hemodynamic response to skull pinning, including IV medication (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> 100 mcg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> 20 to 50 mg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esmolol</a> 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> doses adjusted for patient factors), local anesthetic infiltration at pin sites, and scalp blocks.</p><p>Skin incision and dural opening are other stimulating portions of surgery.

However, patient and iatrogenic movement must be strictly avoided during dissection of the aneurysm itself. (See <a href=\"#H2047322396\" class=\"local\">'Patient immobility'</a> below.)</p><p>During delicate stages of dissection, the surgeon may request a lower BP, though profound hypotension should be avoided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1817997078\"><span class=\"h5\">Temporary clipping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On occasion, the surgeon applies a temporary clip on a feeding artery proximal to the aneurysm to facilitate dissection. Prior to clip placement, decreased BP may help the surgeon manipulate the artery, though profound hypotension should be avoided. Specific, individualized goals should be discussed with the surgeon. </p><p>The temporary clip creates an area of ischemic brain, and neurologic outcomes are worse after longer temporary occlusion times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-intracranial-neurovascular-procedures-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Neuromonitoring (eg, somatosensory evoked potential [SSEP], EEG) can be used to assess adequacy of blood flow; when changes suggest ischemia, or during longer clip times, an increase in MAP of 10 to 20 percent may be appropriate.</p><p>Use of hypothermia and supplementary anesthetic drugs for neuroprotection have not been studied in randomized trials. A post hoc analysis of the Intraoperative Hypothermia for Aneurysm Surgery Trial (IHAST) study found that anesthetic neuroprotective drugs and induced hypothermia were not associated with improved outcomes in patients who had temporary clips applied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-intracranial-neurovascular-procedures-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3225552552\" class=\"local\">'Temperature management'</a> below.)</p><p>The IHAST trial was limited in that only thiopental or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a> was used for supplementary neuroprotection. Further, no harm was noted in patients who did receive supplementary neuroprotective drugs. As such, some practitioners (including one author) still administer supplementary anesthetic drugs for neuroprotection. For this purpose, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, barbiturates, or etomidate may be administered to reduce cerebral metabolic rate while maintaining MAP. An example would be administration of propofol 20 to 60 mg IV, or increase of an existing propofol infusion to &gt;125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/minute</span> IV. Propofol administration can also be titrated to achieve burst suppression if EEG monitoring is used.

This technique can be used as an alternative to temporary clipping, or in the event of aneurysm rupture, in selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-intracranial-neurovascular-procedures-in-adults/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. Adenosine should not be administered to patients with severe reactive airway disease, severe coronary artery disease, or cardiac conduction abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Transcutaneous pacing pads should be placed on patients who are likely to receive adenosine for possible temporary pacing or cardioversion. Optimal dosing for adenosine in this setting is unclear, and the dose response may vary. Escalating doses have often been administered, starting with an initial dose of 6 to 12 mg IV and adding increments of 6 mg. In one case series including 27 patients, adenosine doses between 0.24 and 0.42 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV resulted in 30 to 60 seconds of asystole or hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-intracranial-neurovascular-procedures-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. If there is no time for dose escalation (eg, aneurysm rupture), we administer an initial dose of adenosine 0.4 to 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV, expecting asystole for 20 to 40 seconds, though it may last 60 seconds or more. If repeat adenosine induced flow arrest is required, it should be delayed until the patient returns to sinus rhythm and pre-adenosine BP.</p><p/><p>In carefully selected patients, adenosine-induced flow arrest appears to be safe, with few complications. However, self-limited post-adenosine arrhythmias and ST segment depressions have rarely been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-intracranial-neurovascular-procedures-in-adults/abstract/9,10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3968373907\"><span class=\"h5\">Post-aneurysm clip</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the clip is placed in the final position on the aneurysm, normal BP (ie, systolic BP &lt;140 mmHg) is the goal.

Indirect procedures include encephalomyosynangiosis, where a branch of the superficial temporal artery is dissected along with its surrounding muscle and secured directly to the brain surface.

(See <a href=\"#H1872951266\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Unruptured aneurysms and ruptured aneurysm with suspected normal intracranial pressure (ICP) (ie, normal neurologic examination)</strong> &ndash; Aim for systolic BP &le; the patient's normal systolic BP, maximum 140 mmHg, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) &ge;60 mmHg.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Ruptured aneurysm with suspected or known intracranial hypertension</strong> &ndash; Passive hypertension should not be treated. Hypertension in response to noxious stimulation and iatrogenic hypertension due to vasopressors should be avoided, and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) &ge;50 to 60 mmHg should be maintained. (See <a href=\"#H2421983272\" class=\"local\">'Blood pressure goals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A temporary clip may be placed on a feeding vessel to facilitate dissection and permanent clipping. If neuromonitoring shows ischemic changes during temporary clipping or during longer clip times, increasing MAP by 10 to 20 percent may be appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H1817997078\" class=\"local\">'Temporary clipping'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The administration of anesthetic drugs for neuroprotection during temporary clipping is controversial, and practice varies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Induced hypothermia has been shown not to improve outcomes for patients who undergo aneurysm clipping.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adenosine may be administered to induce temporary bradycardia or cardiac arrest to reduce or suspend flow through the aneurysm as an alternative to temporary clipping, or in the event of intraoperative aneurysm rupture. (See <a href=\"#H1784377284\" class=\"local\">'Adenosine-induced temporary flow arrest'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraoperative aneurysm rupture occurs most commonly during aneurysm dissection and clipping. Goals for management are to rapidly create a bloodless field to facilitate clipping, and to protect the brain. Our strategy is as follows (see <a href=\"#H2429067178\" class=\"local\">'Rupture with aneurysm exposed'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Induce hypotension</strong> &ndash; Administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esmolol</a> 10 to 20 mg intravenously (IV) as needed to achieve MAP of 50 to 60 mmHg.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Induce temporary flow arrest</strong> &ndash; If necessary, administer adenosine 0.4 to 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV, expecting 20 to 40 seconds of asystole or bradycardia. (See <a href=\"#H1784377284\" class=\"local\">'Adenosine-induced temporary flow arrest'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Reduce cerebral metabolic rate</strong> &ndash; Administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> 20 to 60 mg IV. If using a propofol infusion for maintenance of anesthesia, increase the propofol rate to &gt;125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/minute</span> IV. If electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring is being used, propofol dosing can be titrated to achieve burst suppression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Volume resuscitate</strong> &ndash; After aneurysm clipping, administer IV fluid and blood products to achieve euvolemia and hemoglobin &ge;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">gm/dL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If aneurysm rupture occurs prior to exposure of the aneurysm in an anesthetized patient, signs may include unexplained hypertension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ICP and a drop in heart rate. Management may include brain imaging, angiography, or continuation with surgery. Anesthetic management should include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Optimize CPP</strong> &ndash; Allow permissive hypertension. Aim for a CPP 50 to 70 mmHg if ICP monitor is in place, or MAP &gt;90 mmHg without ICP monitoring; administer vasopressors as necessary to increase BP. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Manage intracranial hypertension</strong> &ndash; Optimize ventilation, administer osmotherapy, and optimize venous drainage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Reduce cerebral metabolic rate</strong> &ndash; Administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> 20 to 60 mg IV to achieve EEG burst suppression. If using total IV anesthesia (TIVA), increase propofol rate as able to sustain burst suppression (typically &gt;125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/minute</span> IV).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are often treated with combined therapy, including endovascular procedures designed to occlude feeder arteries and reduce the risk of intraoperative hemorrhage, followed by surgical resection of the lesion. During and after resection, these patients are at risk for hemorrhage and normal perfusion pressure breakthrough (NPPB). (See <a href=\"#H1779985\" class=\"local\">'Brain arteriovenous malformations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Goals for anesthesia for endovascular therapy for aneurysms and brain AVMs are similar to the goals for open procedures. (See <a href=\"#H1779945\" class=\"local\">'Endovascular therapy for intracranial aneurysm'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1668594690\" class=\"local\">'Embolization for brain arteriovenous malformation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A primary goal for anesthesia for extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass procedures is the avoidance of cerebral ischemia or infarction by maintaining adequate CPP. MAP should be maintained at or above awake level at all times, and hyperventilation should be avoided. (See <a href=\"#H2307428707\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia for extracranial-intracranial bypass'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Management during temporary clipping for these procedures is similar to management during aneurysm clipping.
