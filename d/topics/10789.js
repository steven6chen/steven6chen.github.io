Your doctor or nurse will tell you how much medicine to take and how often to take it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25056350\"><span class=\"h1\">Which medicines might I need?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many different osteoporosis medicines. Your doctor will work with you to choose the best one for you.</p><p>The list below gives basic information on osteoporosis medicines. The table lists the names of some common osteoporosis medicines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83854 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>For more detailed information about your medicines, ask your doctor or nurse for information from Lexicomp available through UpToDate. It explains how to use each medicine, describes its possible side effects, and lists other medicines or foods that can affect how it works.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25056365\"><span class=\"h1\">Bisphosphonates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people being treated for osteoporosis take these medicines first. If they do not work well enough or cause side effects that are too hard to handle, there are other options.</p><p>Bisphosphonates come in a pill or a shot. Most people take one pill every week. If your doctor prescribes a bisphosphonate pill, you must take the medicine exactly as directed. If you don't, the medicine can irritate your throat or stomach. For most bisphosphonate pills, you must:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take the pill first thing in the morning, before you have anything to eat or drink.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink an 8-ounce glass of water with the pill, but not eat or drink anything else for 30 minutes or 1 hour (depending on which pill you take).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid lying down for 30 minutes after taking the pill. You must sit or stand during that time.</p><p/><p>There is one bisphosphonate pill, delayed release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risedronate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">risedronate</a> (brand name: Atelvia), that is taken in a different way from the others. It is taken after breakfast with 4 ounces of water.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25056382\"><span class=\"h1\">&quot;Estrogen-like&quot; medicines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medicines called selective estrogen receptor modifiers (or &quot;SERMs&quot;) act like the hormone &quot;estrogen.&quot; Estrogen helps prevent bone loss. After menopause, a woman's body has less estrogen. (Menopause is the time when a woman stops having periods.) SERMs can act like estrogen to stop bone loss. Some of them also reduce the risk of breast cancer in women at high risk. SERMs are only for women who have gone through menopause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25056397\"><span class=\"h1\">Hormone medicines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These medicines are sometimes called &quot;hormone replacement therapy&quot; or &quot;menopausal hormone therapy&quot; (MHT). After menopause, a woman's body has lower levels of certain hormones. Some women take MHT to replace these hormones. MHT can also protect against osteoporosis.</p><p>Hormones are not used often to treat osteoporosis in women who have gone through menopause. This is because other medicines usually work much better. But MHT can help women who have bothersome symptoms related to menopause (such as hot flashes) and who have osteoporosis but cannot take other osteoporosis medicines.</p><p>Women who have not gone through menopause might take hormones in birth control pills or a patch to prevent osteoporosis.</p><p>Some men get osteoporosis because their bodies do not make enough of a hormone called &quot;testosterone.&quot; If this happens, doctors can give testosterone to treat the osteoporosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25056414\"><span class=\"h1\">PTH or PTHrP analog</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both of these are artificial forms of hormones the body makes naturally. PTH stands for &quot;parathyroid hormone,&quot; and PTHrP stands for &quot;parathyroid hormone-related protein.&quot; Both tell the body to make new bone. They are usually only for people with severe osteoporosis</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25056448\"><span class=\"h1\">Denosumab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Denosumab</a> is a medicine that blocks a protein in the body. This protein usually causes bone to break down. By blocking the protein, denosumab reduces bone loss and the chance of breaking a bone. If other osteoporosis medicines cause bad side effects or do not help, your doctor might give you denosumab. It might also be a good choice for people with kidney problems. It is given as a shot under the skin every 6 months. When you stop taking denosumab, your bone density goes down again very quickly. Some people might be at higher risk for breaking a bone when this happens. If you stop denosumab, your doctor will prescribe a different osteoporosis medicine to prevent rapid bone loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5240141\"><span class=\"h1\">Calcitonin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Calcitonin</a> is a hormone the body makes naturally. Doctors can give a man-made form to treat osteoporosis. It is not used as often as other medicines because it does not work as well. But it can help relieve pain from broken bones in the spine. When used for broken bones in the spine, calcitonin should only be used until the pain is better (and not longer than 6 months). If you are put on calcitonin, after 6 months you should switch to a medicine that is better at preventing fractures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25056465\"><span class=\"h1\">How long do I need to take osteoporosis medicines?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are at high risk for breaking a bone, you can safely take osteoporosis medicines for many years. If you are not at high risk for breaking a bone, you might be able to stop your medicine for a year or more. Your doctor will check your bone density to make sure you are not losing too much bone. If you do stop the medicine, you will probably need to start it again later.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25056482\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I know about medicines for osteoporosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people have heard that taking bisphosphonates for a long time can increase the risk of breaking certain bones. This is true, but it happens very rarely. Your chances of breaking a bone from osteoporosis are much higher than your chances of breaking one because you take bisphosphonates.</p><p>If you take osteoporosis medicines, your doctor will do regular exams and tests to see how well the medicines are working. If they are not working well, you might need a different medicine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25056499\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-density-testing-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone density testing (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoporosis (The Basics)</a> </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-density-testing-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bone density testing (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Exercise (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-prevention-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Osteoporosis prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
