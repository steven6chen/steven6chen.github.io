Asthma does not always cause symptoms. But when a person with asthma has an &quot;attack&quot; or a flare up, it can be very scary. Asthma attacks happen when the airways in the lungs become narrow and inflamed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65956\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65956 \">figure 1</a>). Asthma can run in families.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H212326386\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of asthma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asthma symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wheezing, or noisy breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coughing, often at night or early in the morning, or when you exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tight feeling in the chest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p/><p>Symptoms can happen each day, each week, or less often. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. Although rare, an episode of asthma can lead to death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H212326393\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for asthma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor might have your child do a breathing test to see how his or her lungs are working. Most children 6 years old and older can do this test. This test is useful, but it is often normal in children with asthma if they have no symptoms at the time of the test.</p><p>Your doctor will also do an exam and ask questions such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What symptoms does your child have?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How often does he or she have the symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do the symptoms wake him or her up at night?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do the symptoms keep your child from playing or going to school?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do certain things make symptoms worse, like having a cold or exercising?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do certain things make symptoms better, like medicine or resting?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H212326400\"><span class=\"h1\">How is asthma treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asthma is treated with different types of medicines. The medicines can be inhalers, liquids, or pills. Your doctor will prescribe medicine based on your child's age and his or her symptoms. Asthma medicines work in 1 of 2 ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Quick-relief medicines</strong> stop symptoms quickly. These medicines should only be used once in a while. If your child regularly needs these medicines more than twice a week, tell his or her doctor. You should also call your child's doctor if this medicine is used for an asthma attack and symptoms come back quickly, or do not get better. Some children get hyperactive, and have trouble staying still, after taking these medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Long-term controller medicines</strong> control asthma and prevent future symptoms. If your child has frequent symptoms or several severe episodes in a year, he or she might need to take these each day.</p><p/><p>Almost all children with asthma use an inhaler with a device called a &quot;spacer.&quot; Some children also need a machine called a &quot;nebulizer&quot; to breathe in their medicine. A doctor or nurse will show you the right way to use these.</p><p>It is very important that you give your child all the medicines the doctor prescribes. You might worry about giving a child a lot of medicine. But leaving your child's asthma untreated has much bigger risks than any risks the medicines might have. Asthma that is not treated with the right medicines can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevent children from doing normal activities, such as playing sports</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make children miss school</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damage the lungs</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H212326407\"><span class=\"h1\">What is an asthma action plan?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An asthma action plan is a list of instructions that tell you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What medicines your child should use at home each day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What warning symptoms to watch for (which suggest that asthma is getting worse)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What other medicines to give your child if the symptoms get worse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When to get help or <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong></p><p/><p>You, your child, and your doctor will work together to make an asthma action plan for your child. As part of the action plan, your child might need to use a device called a &quot;peak flow meter.&quot; This device is used at home to see how well your child's lungs are working. Your doctor will show you and your child the right way to use a peak flow meter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H212326414\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See a doctor or nurse if your child has an asthma attack and the symptoms do not improve or get worse after using a quick-relief medicine. <strong>If the symptoms are severe, call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H212326421\"><span class=\"h1\">Can asthma symptoms be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can help prevent your child's asthma symptoms by giving your child the daily medicines the doctor prescribes. You can also keep your child away from things that cause or make the symptoms worse. Doctors call these &quot;triggers.&quot; If you know what your child's triggers are, you can try to avoid them. If you don't know what they are, your doctor can help figure it out.</p><p>Some common triggers include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting sick with a cold or the flu (that's why it's important to get a flu shot each year)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergens (such as dust mites; molds; furry animals, including cats and dogs; and pollens from trees, grasses, and weeds)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cigarette smoke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in weather, cold air, hot and humid air</p><p/><p>If you can't avoid certain triggers, talk with your doctor about what you can do. For example, exercise can be good for children with asthma. But your child might need to take an extra dose of his or her quick-relief inhaler before exercising.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H212326428\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my child's life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children with asthma are able to live normal lives. You can help manage your child's asthma by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Making changes in your life to avoid your child's triggers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keeping track of your child's asthma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following the action plan</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Telling your doctor when your child's symptoms change</p><p/><p>Sometimes, asthma gets better as children get older. They might not have asthma symptoms when they become adults. But other children can still have asthma when they grow up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H212326435\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-asthma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for asthma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=avoiding-asthma-triggers-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Avoiding asthma triggers (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Flu (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breathing-tests-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breathing tests (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-asthma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Exercise-induced asthma (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-symptoms-and-diagnosis-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma symptoms and diagnosis in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-treatment-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma treatment in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-asthma-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Exercise-induced asthma (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigger-avoidance-in-asthma-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Trigger avoidance in asthma (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-inhaler-techniques-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma inhaler techniques in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-a-peak-flow-meter-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: How to use a peak flow meter (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
