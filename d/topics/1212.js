An increase in circulating lymphocytes (lymphocytosis) can be seen following infections such as infectious mononucleosis and pertussis, or in lymphoproliferative disorders such as acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A similar array of disorders can cause a decrease in lymphocyte counts (lymphocytopenia), although immunodeficiency states must also be considered, especially in infants and young children.</p><p>The various causes of lymphocytosis and lymphocytopenia in children will be reviewed here.

Similarly, bone marrows of young children can contain hematogones (ie, normal maturing B cell precursors) that look immature and can be difficult to distinguish morphologically from lymphocytic leukemia blasts.
