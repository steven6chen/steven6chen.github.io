Among patients with at least moderate VHD in developed countries, aortic valve stenosis (AS) is most common, followed by mitral regurgitation then aortic regurgitation and finally mitral stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>For appropriate diagnosis and management of AS, it is crucial to assess the severity of AS as accurately as possible. However, the diagnosis and evaluation of AS is challenging due to a variety of pitfalls. These include discrepancies between severity of AS and patient symptoms, between transvalvular mean pressure gradient and aortic valve area, and between echocardiography and other imaging modalities. In addition, a number of confounding factors and technical issues affect the assessment of AS, including the presence of concurrent conditions such as uncontrolled hypertension, rapid atrial fibrillation, left ventricular dysfunction, and significant mitral regurgitation or stenosis, as well as the occurrence of measurement errors.</p><p>Issues relating to the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of low gradient AS will be reviewed here. Management and prognosis of low gradient severe AS, and the clinical presentation and management of classical high gradient severe AS are discussed separately.

In patients with LFLG true severe AS, the low gradient is caused by a low stroke volume. When true severe AS is accompanied by LV systolic dysfunction, the LV dysfunction may be secondary to AS or caused by a concurrent condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Since valve replacement is likely to be beneficial in patients with true severe AS, patients with this condition should undergo evaluation to assess indications and risks of valve replacement. </p><p>In patients with pseudosevere AS, a low transvalvular pressure gradient is caused by the combination of mild to moderate AS and low stroke volume. The low stroke volume can occur in the context of reduced LVEF or preserved LVEF. The low stroke volume reduces the valve opening forces, resulting in limited opening of a valve that is not severely diseased. The resting calculated AVA may be misinterpreted as suggesting severe stenosis because of limited opening as well as valve area equation limitations when applied to low flow rate conditions. Unlike patients with true severe AS, patients with pseudosevere AS are unlikely to benefit from valve replacement and face considerable risk of operative death. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H732278733\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although data are limited, it has been estimated that up to one-half of patients with a small aortic valve area (ie, &lt;1 cm<sup>2</sup>) have low gradient aortic stenosis (AS; mean transvalvular gradient &lt;40 mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Based upon retrospective data, classical low flow, low gradient (LFLG) severe AS represents approximately 5 to 10 percent of the severe AS population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The prevalence of paradoxical LFLG severe AS is more controversial with rates ranging from 5 to 25 percent of the severe AS population, depending upon the population studied (eg, asymptomatic versus symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]) and the technique used to define AS severity (echocardiogram versus catheter versus magnetic resonance imaging) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Normal flow, low gradient AS is common, constituting approximately 15 to 40 percent of severe AS cases. </p><p>Limited prospective data are available on the prevalence of LFLG AS. Among 971 patients with severe AS included in the prospective PARTNER trial, the following rates of low flow AS were identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low flow (LV stroke volume index &le;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> was found in 55 percent (530 patients)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low flow and low LVEF (&lt;50 percent) in 23 percent (225 patients) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low flow, low LVEF, and low aortic valve gradient (&lt;40 mmHg) (ie, classical LFLG AS) in 15 percent (147 patients)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1276063546\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One or more of the following factors may cause low gradient aortic stenosis (AS): low stroke volume (with or without left ventricular [LV] systolic dysfunction), excess arterial afterload, and discrepant aortic valve area (AVA) and gradient thresholds used in guidelines.</p><p>Since the aortic transvalvular gradient depends upon the severity of aortic valve stenosis and the flow rate, a low flow rate (stroke volume divided by systolic ejection period) is frequently associated with a low transvalvular gradient. A low stroke volume may be caused by either LV systolic dysfunction with depressed LV ejection fraction (LVEF &lt;50 percent as in classical low flow, low gradient [LFLG] AS) or small ventricular volumes with preserved LVEF &ge;50 percent as in paradoxical LFLG AS. Among patients with LFLG AS, low flow may result in incomplete valve opening and thus overestimation of AS (ie, a lower AVA than present with a higher stroke volume). (See <a href=\"#H4132721183\" class=\"local\">'True severe versus pseudo-severe AS'</a> above.)</p><p>In patients with classical LFLG AS, impaired LV function may be caused primarily by AS itself, causing chronic pressure overload, can be secondary to other conditions (eg, concurrent coronary artery disease or severe mitral regurgitation) or most commonly is caused by the combined effect of the aortic valve lesion and concurrent conditions. </p><p>In patients with paradoxical LFLG AS, several causes may contribute to a low stroke volume despite a preserved LVEF. In patients with this disorder, low stroke volume is commonly associated with concentric LV remodeling or hypertrophy with a small LV cavity, impaired LV diastolic filling, and impaired LV longitudinal systolic function despite preserved LVEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This state is uncommonly preceded by a high gradient state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Elevated arterial afterload caused by severe, uncontrolled, long-standing hypertension also contributes to the development of paradoxical LFLG AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/10,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,15</a>].<strong> </strong>Additional conditions that may contribute to low stroke volume in patients with preserved LVEF include atrial fibrillation, significant mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation, and right ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Patients with paradoxical LFLG AS usually have elevated valvuloarterial impedance (Zva), an expression of the total load the LV is facing (ie, the ventricular plus the arterial load) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. The valvuloarterial impedance is calculated using the following formula: </p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>Zva = (mean pressure aortic gradient + systolic brachial artery <span class=\"nowrap\">pressure)/(stroke</span> volume index)</p></div></div><p>in which the stroke volume is indexed to body surface area and expressed in <span class=\"nowrap\">mmHg/mL/m<sup>2</sup></span>.</p><p>As noted above, normal flow, low gradient (NFLG) AS is a common cause of low gradient AS. One cause for this is that the guideline cut-point for AVA of 1 cm<sup>2</sup> to detect severe AS is a sensitive marker for mortality associated with severe AS but corresponds to a mean gradient of 30 to 35 mmHg (rather than 40 mmHg) in the presence of normal flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/5,8,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,19</a>]. Thus, application of the guideline criteria for severe AS will lead to detection of numerous cases of NFLG AS. Another potential cause of NFLG AS is arterial afterload caused by reduced aortic compliance and associated systolic hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3259543092\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of low gradient aortic stenosis (LG AS) are the same as for calcific AS generally.

Symptoms and signs of LG severe AS are the same as those for high gradient severe AS.</p><p>Symptoms typical for AS include dyspnea on exertion or decreased exercise tolerance, exertional angina, and dizziness (presyncope) or syncope. The classic symptoms of AS (heart failure, syncope, and angina) reflect advanced disease. Since these symptoms are nonspecific, care must be taken in attributing these symptoms to AS, since most patients with these symptoms do not have AS. When angina is present, it may be caused by AS or by concurrent coronary artery disease.

However, a chest radiograph may be obtained in some patients with dyspnea to assess for signs of heart failure and other potential causes of shortness of breath. In patients with AS, the chest radiograph may be normal or may show nonspecific signs such as increased heart size, pleural effusion, interstitial or alveolar edema consistent with pulmonary edema due to heart failure.

The ability of plasma BNP to separate patients with true stenosis from those with pseudostenosis was evaluated in the TOPAS study, which enrolled 69 symptomatic (81 percent New York Heart Association functional class II and III) patients with low flow (indexed aortic orifice area &lt;0.6 cm<sup>2</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> and low gradient (mean gradient &le;40 mmHg) AS with reduced LVEF (&le;40 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. After classification using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress echocardiography, patients with true AS (29) compared with those with pseudostenosis (40) had significantly higher BNP levels (median, 743 versus 471 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL),</span> though there was overlap between the two groups. Further studies are needed to determine the value of natriuretic peptide testing in evaluation of LGLS AS, particularly since BNP may be elevated due to LV dysfunction with heart failure, even when AS is not severe. </p><p>One-year survival was significantly lower in those patients with a plasma BNP &ge;550 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> compared with those with &lt;550 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (47 versus 97 percent) in the entire cohort and in the 29 patients who underwent surgery (53 versus 92 percent). These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that outcome depends upon the severity of LV dysfunction and heart failure. However, plasma BNP will rarely affect clinical decision-making because all of these patients benefit from aortic valve replacement, unless the surgical risk is prohibitive.</p><p>The use of plasma BNP to predict outcome from surgery is presented below and an overview of the use of plasma BNP as a tool for diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease is discussed separately.

GLS is an echocardiographic imaging technique that enables myocardial deformation analysis for precise and early detection of LV systolic dysfunction. GLS has been found to be a robust method of detecting subtle LV dysfunction associated with adverse clinical outcomes in various cardiac diseases. It has also been studied as a marker of adverse outcomes in patients with paradoxical LFLG AS. GLS in patients with paradoxical low flow AS is depressed compared with that in patients with normal flow AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Moreover, higher valvuloarterial impedance was a significant predictor of reduced GLS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tissue-doppler-echocardiography#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tissue Doppler echocardiography&quot;, section on 'Assessment of global and regional left ventricular systolic function'</a>.)</p><p>A multicenter study including 340 asymptomatic patients with severe AS and normal LVEF found that 9 percent had paradoxical LFLG AS. LFLG AS was associated with markedly reduced basal longitudinal systolic function as assessed by two-dimensional GLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This suggests that subclinical myocardial dysfunction is more prominent in paradoxical LFLG AS compared with normal flow low gradient AS and a potential value of GLS in diagnosing paradoxical LFLG AS.</p><p>Some other studies have assessed LV systolic function using the technically simpler approach of the mitral annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE) or displacement (calculated as the mean of septal and lateral systolic mitral annular motion using M-mode echocardiography in an apical four chamber view). These studies suggest that MAPSE may also be helpful in distinguishing true stenosis from pseudostenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In a population of patients with at least moderate AS and mean transvalvular pressure gradient &lt;40 mmHg, all 20 patients with MAPSE &lt;9 mm had severe AS and all 17 of those with displacements &ge;9 mm had moderate AS. Moreover, MAPSE was inversely correlated with interstitial fibrosis on myocardial biopsy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H522987905\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, when low gradient aortic stenosis (LG AS) is suspected based upon transthoracic echocardiogram results, the first step is to exclude measurement error due to technical issues such as inaccurate transvalvular or left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) velocity measurement or inaccurate measurement of LVOT dimension. As an example, valve area may be underestimated using the continuity equation, if the LVOT diameter and thus LVOT flow is underestimated. Also, for patients with small body size, it is important to adjust AVA for body size (ie, identify severe AS using a threshold of AVA indexed to body surface area &le;0.6 cm<sup>2</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/m<sup>2</sup></span> instead of AVA &le;1 cm<sup>2</sup>); in small patients, an AVA slightly less than 1 cm<sup>2</sup> may represent moderate AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>After findings consistent with LG AS are confirmed, other imaging modalities (chiefly low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress echocardiography and multidetector computed tomography) are used to distinguish true severe AS from pseudosevere AS. (See <a href=\"#H4132721183\" class=\"local\">'True severe versus pseudo-severe AS'</a> above and <a href=\"#H995232154\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation based upon type of low gradient AS'</a> above and <a href=\"#H675231605\" class=\"local\">'Low-dose dobutamine stress echocardiogram'</a> above and <a href=\"#H341523490\" class=\"local\">'Multidetector computed tomography'</a> above.)</p><p>The differential diagnosis of AS versus other causes of similar physical examination or echocardiography findings is discussed in detail separately. Briefly summarized, transthoracic echocardiography is the key modality for distinguishing AS from other causes of left ventricular outflow obstruction such as supravalvular AS, congenital subvalvular aortic stenosis, and obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In addition, care should be taken to distinguish signal from mitral regurgitation from the jet of AS, since both are high velocity signals directed away from the LV apex.
