The placenta is the organ inside a pregnant woman's uterus that brings her fetus nutrients and oxygen, and carries away waste (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82935\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82935 \">figure 1</a>). The fetus and its placenta share many of the same genes.</p><p>CVS can show if there is something wrong with the fetus's genes or chromosomes. Chromosomes are structures within cells that contain thousands of genes. This test is done between 10 and 13 weeks of pregnancy. Results come back in a few days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469586776\"><span class=\"h1\">Why is CVS done?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CVS is done to check if your fetus has a specific genetic problem, such as Down syndrome, Tay-Sachs disease, cystic fibrosis, or another disease. You might have this test if you have a family history of one of these conditions, or if another test suggests your fetus has a specific genetic problem. Keep in mind, though, that doctors cannot use CVS to check for every possible genetic problem. If your CVS results come back normal, that does not necessarily mean the fetus has no genetic problems. It just means it does not have the condition the doctors tested for.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469586783\"><span class=\"h1\">How is CVS done?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Here are the main steps:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The doctor will do an ultrasound. That is an imaging test that uses sound waves to create a picture of your uterus, fetus, and placenta.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While looking at the ultrasound picture, the doctor will put either a needle into your belly or a tiny tube into your vagina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65622\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65622 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Next, the doctor will guide the needle or tube into your placenta. Then, he or she will take a very tiny sample of tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tissue will be sent to a lab for tests.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469586790\"><span class=\"h1\">Does CVS have any risks?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Problems are rare, but they can happen. Risks include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Miscarriage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leaking of blood from the fetus into your own bloodstream. This can cause problems for later pregnancies.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469586797\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I be worried about symptoms after the procedure?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on what symptoms you have and how bad they are. After CVS, it is normal to bleed a little from your vagina.</p><p>Call your doctor if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have vaginal bleeding that is like what you have during your period</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are leaking fluid from your vagina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have cramps that are getting worse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a fever higher than 100.4&deg;F (38&ordm;C)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469586804\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there an alternative to CVS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is another test, called amniocentesis, which can also test for genetic problems in the fetus. But amniocentesis is done later in pregnancy, usually around week 15 to 17.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469586811\"><span class=\"h1\">Is it better to do CVS or amniocentesis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on your individual situation. You might not need either one. If you do decide to have testing, you might choose CVS over amniocentesis because:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You want results as soon as possible in the pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You want results more quickly after the test</p><p/><p>You might choose amniocentesis over CVS because:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is slightly less risk of miscarriage with amniocentesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are already in the second trimester, meaning you have been pregnant for more than 3 months</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469586818\"><span class=\"h1\">What if the test shows my fetus has a specific genetic problem?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should talk to a genetic counselor before and after the test. He or she can help you understand what to expect, your feelings, and what to do.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469586825\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amniocentesis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Amniocentesis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chorionic-villus-sampling-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chorionic villus sampling (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amniocentesis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Amniocentesis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
