Postdates pregnancy and prolonged pregnancy are less commonly used synonyms for postterm pregnancy.</p><p>Of note, early term is defined as 37+0 to 38+6 weeks of gestation, full term is defined as 39+0<sup> </sup>to 40+6 weeks of gestation, and late term is 41+0 to 41+6<sup> </sup>weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-pregnancy/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States in 2015, birth certificate data indicated that 0.40 percent of pregnancies delivered at &ge;42 weeks and 6.5 percent delivered at 41 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A study of birth rates &ge;42 weeks in 13 European countries observed a wide range across the continent: from 0.4 and 0.6 percent in Austria and Belgium to 7.5 and 8.1 percent in Sweden and Denmark [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Variations in prevalence are likely due to the factors discussed below.</p><p>One of the most important factors impacting prevalence of postterm pregnancy is whether early ultrasound assessment of gestational age is performed routinely, as this tends to reduce the prevalence compared with menstrual dating. In a meta-analysis that compared the rate of labor induction for postterm pregnancy in women who underwent sonographic estimation of their delivery date early in pregnancy with the rate in women whose estimated delivery date was calculated from their LMP, early routine ultrasound examination reduced the rate of intervention for postterm pregnancy by 40 percent (from <span class=\"nowrap\">31/1000</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">18/1000;</span> odds ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.42-0.83; eight trials, n = 25,516), although the evidence was of low quality because of heterogeneity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Other factors that affect the prevalence of postterm pregnancy in a population include the prevalence of primigravid women, which shifts the gestational age at birth curve to the right since they are more likely to deliver postterm. Factors that shift the gestational age at birth curve to the left include a high prevalence of spontaneous preterm birth <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> women with pregnancy complications, and local practice patterns such as a high rate of planned cesarean delivery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> elective labor induction at term.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of postterm pregnancies have no known etiology. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One-third to one-half of the variation in postterm birth in a population can be attributed to maternal or fetal genetic influence on the initiation of parturition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In rare cases, postterm pregnancy has been attributed to defects in fetal production of hormones involved in parturition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-parturition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of parturition&quot;</a>)`. For example, fetal disorders associated with placental sulfatase deficiency (eg, X-linked ichthyosis) result in extremely low estriol levels and other hormonal changes compared with normal pregnancies. The mean duration of pregnancies with placental sulfatase deficiency appears to be one week longer than pregnancies without this disorder, although most such pregnancies still deliver before 42 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-pregnancy/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Anencephaly, which results in absence or hypoplasia of the hypothalamus and pituitary and adrenal hypoplasia, often results in postterm pregnancy when polyhydramnios is absent (mean gestational age at delivery: 311 days with no polyhydramnios versus 253 days with polyhydramnios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]).

Macrosomia increases the risks for several adverse sequelae, including abnormal labor progression, cesarean delivery, assisted vaginal delivery, shoulder dystocia, <span class=\"nowrap\">maternal/fetal/newborn</span> birth injury, postpartum hemorrhage, and neonatal metabolic problems.

These fetuses are at increased risk of umbilical cord compression due to oligohydramnios, and abnormal antepartum or intrapartum fetal heart rate patterns due to placental insufficiency or cord compression. Meconium passage is common and may be related to physiological maturation of the gut or fetal hypoxia. </p><p>Affected neonates have a long thin body, long nails, and are small for gestational age. Their skin is dry (vernix caseosa is decreased or absent), meconium-stained, parchment-like, and peeling; it appears loose, especially over the thighs and buttocks, and has prominent creases; lanugo hair is sparse or absent, while scalp hair is increased. These neonates are at risk for morbidities associated with growth restriction, including hypoglycemia, polycythemia, perinatal asphyxia, meconium aspiration, and persistent pulmonary hypertension. They are also at risk for neurodevelopmental complications (eg, seizures, cerebral palsy).

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of postterm pregnancy is based on the clinician's most accurate estimate of the patient's delivery date, which is based on LMP for some patients and on ultrasound dating for others (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F97246\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97246 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2305990\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In pregnancies dated by first-trimester ultrasound examination, the prevalence of postterm pregnancy is about 2 percent and fewer inductions are performed for postterm pregnancy than in pregnancies dated by LMP. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women at highest risk of postterm pregnancy are those with a previous postterm pregnancy. The risk of a second postterm pregnancy is increased two- to fourfold and is even higher after two prior postterm pregnancies. (See <a href=\"#H3308803744\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H549133942\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many of the maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications of postterm pregnancy are sequelae of either excessive fetal growth (macrosomia) or placental insufficiency <span class=\"nowrap\">(fetal/neonatal</span> dysmaturity, growth restriction, oligohydramnios). (See <a href=\"#H22781905\" class=\"local\">'Macrosomia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22781911\" class=\"local\">'Dysmaturity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perinatal mortality increases with increasing gestational age after 40 weeks of gestation, but the absolute risk of fetal death is low:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>40 to 41 weeks: 0.86 to 1.08 per 1000 ongoing pregnancies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>41 to 42 weeks: 1.2 to 1.27 per 1000 ongoing pregnancies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>42 to 43 weeks: 1.3 to 1.9 per 1000 ongoing pregnancies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&gt;43 weeks: 1.58 to 6.3 per 1000 ongoing pregnancies</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Intrauterine infection, placental insufficiency or cord compression leading to fetal hypoxia and asphyxia, and meconium aspiration are thought to contribute to the excess perinatal deaths. (See <a href=\"#H22781917\" class=\"local\">'Perinatal mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In postterm pregnancies without fetal malformations, signs of placental insufficiency, or maternal disorders associated with adverse pregnancy outcome (eg, diabetes, hypertension), it is unclear whether or to what degree perinatal mortality is increased. (See <a href=\"#H22781917\" class=\"local\">'Perinatal mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pregnancies &ge;41+0 weeks of gestation, we suggest induction rather than expectant management (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Induction is associated with lower perinatal mortality than expectant management and does not increase the risk of cesarean delivery. The absolute benefits of routine induction are modest, however, and depending on personal values and preferences, some women may choose to be managed expectantly. (See <a href=\"#H2306245\" class=\"local\">'Our approach: Induction at 41+0 to 42+0 weeks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women at 41+0<sup> </sup>weeks who choose expectant management, we monitor fetal well-being by nonstress testing with amniotic fluid volume assessment or by the biophysical profile, twice weekly beginning at 41+0<sup> </sup>weeks or shortly thereafter. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Alternative approach: Expectant management with fetal monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In expectantly managed pregnancies, we agree with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommendation to induce labor by 42+6 weeks of gestation. Earlier induction is indicated for development of any of the usual obstetrical indications. (See <a href=\"#H22782371\" class=\"local\">'Timing of delivery in expectantly managed pregnancies'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">ACOG Committee Opinion No 579: Definition of term pregnancy.
