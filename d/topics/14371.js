Despite having the same genetic code, cells from different tissues behave very differently. These differences are not explained by differences in genome sequence, but rather are created by additional layers of regulation that determine which genes are expressed to create a cell-specific phenotype. Epigenetic regulation, which can increase or decrease the expression of genes without altering genomic sequence, contributes to this cell-type-specific variation.</p><p>Several terms and basic concepts apply to epigenetic regulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epigenome</strong> &ndash; The epigenome consists of the entire epigenetic code across all of the cells in the body. It is contrasted to the genome in that the genome is constant across all cell types (with limited exceptions such as VDJ rearrangement in lymphocytes), but the epigenome varies from one cell type to another. In addition, while both are heritable, the epigenome can be reprogrammed, whereas the genome cannot. Reprogramming of the epigenome can occur during stages of normal development, in response to environmental exposures, in acquired disease states, and in response to medications that target epigenetic regulators. (See <a href=\"#H4047230272\" class=\"local\">'Types of processes that are regulated'</a> below and <a href=\"#H396146\" class=\"local\">'Role of epigenetic changes in disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H396153\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic uses'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epigenetics</strong> &ndash; Epigenetics as a field of study refers to the analysis of changes that can occur on chromatin and DNA that are heritable and do not affect the primary DNA sequence and their causes and biologic (and medical) implications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epigenetic modification</strong> &ndash; An epigenetic modification (epigenetic change, epigenetic mark) is a chemical alteration to DNA or chromatin that does not affect the primary DNA sequence. Most definitions state that these changes are heritable from one cell to its progeny. Unlike changes to the genomic sequence, epigenetic changes are reversible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Typically, epigenetic changes involve covalent attachment (or removal) of a small side chain (methyl group, acetyl group) to a DNA base or a histone protein. These changes alter the expression and regulation of genes and other DNA elements in a predictable fashion, although the specific implications of a modification (especially a histone modification) can be context-dependent; these have been referred to as the &quot;histone code&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. These modifications and their consequences are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H197828167\" class=\"local\">'DNA methylation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2547167206\" class=\"local\">'Histone modifications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epigenetic regulation</strong> &ndash; Epigenetic regulation refers to the regulation of gene expression by epigenetic modifications. The modifications affect how easy it is for transcription factors, DNA polymerase, small RNAs, and other factors to physically interact with DNA. When the modifications are directly on the DNA, they are often located in the promoter or enhancer regions of the affected gene (ie, <em>cis</em>-regulatory elements) and alter access of the transcriptional machinery to the associated gene (eg, reduce or increase access to the gene). When the modifications are on histones, they affect how tightly the DNA is wrapped around the histone, which in turn affects how easy it is for these factors to access these DNA regions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some experts refer to the enzymes that create these DNA and histone modifications as &quot;writers&quot; and the enzymes that remove them as &quot;erasers&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F116423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116423 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The proteins that recognize the marks are referred to as &quot;readers&quot;; there are a number of motifs in the reader proteins that can be used to recognize epigenetic modifications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Epigenetic regulation is different from transcriptional regulation; transcription is controlled by a number of tissue-specific transcription factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-molecular-genetics#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of molecular genetics&quot;, section on 'RNA transcription'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Silencing</strong> &ndash; Silencing refers to reducing (or completely suppressing) expression of a gene. This can be achieved by the epigenetic mechanisms described below or by the actions of small RNAs that interfere with messenger RNA (mRNA) stability. Some experts consider these small RNAs, which may include small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), to be epigenetic regulators as well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Imprinting</strong> &ndash; Imprinting refers to specific epigenetic modifications that are only added in either the male or female gametes (sperm and ova, respectively), subsequently resulting in parent-of-origin-specific gene regulation. Female-derived genes that are normally inactivated (ie, silenced in ova) are said to be maternally imprinted; male-derived genes that are normally silenced in sperm are said to be paternally imprinted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The classic clinical example is a region of chromosome 15 (the 15q11 gene cluster), which is differentially inactivated according to the sex of the parent of origin (parentally imprinted). The consequence of parental imprinting is that, if an individual inherits a pathogenic gene deletion affecting this cluster, the resulting phenotypic abnormalities differ depending on whether the mutation was inherited from the mother or the father. An inherited abnormality of this region derived from the mother results in Angelman syndrome, whereas an abnormality of this region inherited from the father results in Prader-Willi syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22#H86261867\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microdeletion syndromes (chromosomes 12 to 22)&quot;, section on '15q11-13 maternal deletion syndrome (Angelman syndrome)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Imprinting is also responsible for differences in offspring that arise from interspecies mating of animals. As an example, the offspring of a male horse and a female donkey is a hinny (which has a thicker mane), while the offspring of a female horse and a male donkey is a mule (which has longer ears) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Imprinting is responsible for some apparent deviations from classical Mendelian inheritance, as described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian#H1457606458\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inheritance patterns of monogenic disorders (Mendelian and non-Mendelian)&quot;, section on 'Parent-of-origin effects (imprinting)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heritability</strong> &ndash; Heritability is a feature included in most definitions of epigenetic modifications. The heritability of epigenetic changes refers to conserved changes from one cell division to another. In practical terms, the histone modifications may be removed during mitosis and added back in daughter cells, resulting in preserved information about the change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Conservation of DNA methylation is coupled to DNA replication because DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) interact with the replication machinery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H396231\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF REGULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epigenetic regulation can be thought of as an additional layer of gene regulation beyond the DNA sequence that is more malleable and, because it is combinatorial and can result in a larger variety of outputs, is potentially more extensive than genetic regulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1519279242\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of epigenetic marks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Broadly speaking, there are two main forms of epigenetic modifications: those that directly modify DNA (ie, DNA methylation) and those that modify DNA-binding proteins (ie, histone modifications).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197828167\"><span class=\"h3\">DNA methylation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methyl groups can be added or removed from DNA, often in the promoter and enhancer regions of genes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F116212\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116212 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>DNA methylation</strong> &ndash; DNA methylation involves addition of a methyl group (CH<sub>3</sub>) to carbon 5 in a cytosine base to create 5-methylcytosine. In mammalian DNA, DNA methylation occurs almost exclusively at cytosines. Common sites for DNA methylation include promoter or enhancer regions of the affected gene (ie, <em>cis</em>-regulatory elements). Chromatin-regulatory proteins (eg, MeCP2, MBD2) bind to the methylated cytosines and reduce access of the transcriptional machinery to the gene, creating domains of repressed chromatin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. As a result, the consequence of DNA methylation in a gene promoter is often to prevent transcription of (ie, to &quot;silence&quot;) that gene.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In somatic cells, cytosine methylation occurs predominantly on cytosines that are part of a CpG dinucleotide (cytosine-phosphate-guanine)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In embryonic stem cells, up to one fourth of cytosine methylation occurs on non-CpG cytosines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In cancer cells, cytosine methylation is almost exclusively on cytosines in CpG dinucleotides</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The enzymes that catalyze DNA methylation are referred to as DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). DNMT3A and DNMT3B are responsible for creating new methylation marks and are therefore referred to as &quot;de novo DNMTs.&quot; The heritability of DNA marks is maintained by another DNMT (DNMT1) during cell division. DNMT1 is coupled to the replication machinery. During S-phase of the cell cycle (DNA replication), the methyl group remains on the template (ie, the original) DNA strand, and this is copied to the new strand by DNMT1, thus maintaining the methylation symmetry across the CpG dinucleotide in the newly synthesized DNA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>DNA hypomethylation</strong> &ndash; DNA hypomethylation involves removal of one or more methyl groups from cytosine bases, which may activate expression of a gene that was previously silenced; lack of methylation permits a more open chromatin configuration that facilitates transcription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The term hypomethylation is used rather than demethylation because a few methyl groups may remain. Removal of methyl groups from DNA requires several steps, catalyzed by the TET proteins, referred to as methylcytosine dioxygenases, which get their name from the chromosome <strong>t</strong>en-<strong>e</strong>leven <strong>t</strong>ranslocation seen in some myeloid malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H396188\" class=\"local\">'Cancer'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>DNA hypermethylation</strong> &ndash; DNA hypermethylation involves addition of more methyl groups to a gene or group of genes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2547167206\"><span class=\"h3\">Histone modifications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histones are proteins that form a multi-subunit core (often depicted as a disc) around which DNA can be wrapped to form a nucleosome; this is the first level of DNA compaction needed to assemble linear DNA into highly compacted chromosomes. Although the DNA in chromosomes is tightly packaged, it is wrapped in such a way that individual genes can be accessed through localized unwinding.</p><p>There are several modifications on histones, including methylation, acetylation, ubiquitylation, phosphorylation, and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. These marks are often placed on the unstructured amino terminal &quot;tails&quot; of histone proteins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F116212\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116212 \">figure 1</a>). The histone core is removed from the DNA during cell division; when histones are replaced following cell division, the enzymes also replace the histone modifications.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Histone methylation and demethylation</strong> &ndash; Histone methylation involves addition of methyl groups (CH<sub>3</sub>) to the amino acid lysine (designated as K), often in the histone tail; more than one lysine can be methylated on the same histone protein. The enzymes that catalyze histone methylation are referred to as histone methyltransferases; the enzymes that remove the methyl groups are referred to as histone demethylases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Histone acetylation and deacetylation</strong> &ndash; Histone acetylation refers to addition of an acetyl group (CH<sub>3</sub>CO) to a lysine in a histone protein. The enzymes that catalyze histone acetylation are referred to as histone acetyltransferases (HATs). The enzymes that catalyze removal of an acetyl group from a histone are called histone deacetylases (HDACs). For the most part, these are metal-dependent enzymes that contain zinc in their catalytic site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Histone deacetylation is common in certain malignancies, and inhibition of HDACs is used in certain cancer therapies. (See <a href=\"#H396195\" class=\"local\">'Cancer therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Histone modifications may alter the affinity of the histone proteins for DNA, or they may result in recruitment of other proteins that affect chromatin compaction. The consequences of histone modifications for transcription depend on the specific combinations of modifications. The modifications are named by specifying the histone subunit, the specific amino acid modified, and the type of modification. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modification associated with active transcription include histone 3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me3), histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac), histone 3 lysine 36 methylation (H3K36me3), histone 3 lysine 79 methylation (H3K79me), and histone 4 lysine 20 acetylation (H4K20ac).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modifications associated with silencing and repression include histone 3 lysine 27 methylation (H3K27me3) and histone 3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me3).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4047230272\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of processes that are regulated</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike genetic information, which is constant in nearly every cell (with the exception of lymphocytes that undergo VDJ rearrangement) throughout the life of the individual (unless a somatic mutation occurs), epigenetic information has great plasticity and can be altered depending on the cell type and developmental stage. As a result, epigenetic modifications mediate the differentiation of cells and adoption of different cell fates, which ultimately allows the complexity needed for normal functioning.</p><p>Some of the physiologic examples of epigenetic regulation over the life course include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>X chromosome inactivation</strong> &ndash; Genes on the X chromosome are present in two copies in the female and one copy in the male. In females, somatic cells undergo X-chromosome inactivation (also called X-inactivation or lyonization); the selection of which X chromosome gets inactivated (maternally derived or paternally derived) is random. Skewed X-inactivation is responsible for variable disease courses in women who are heterozygous for certain mutations (eg, hemophilia, hereditary nephritis, chronic granulomatous disease). Mechanisms of X-chromosome inactivation include silencing by the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Xist and methylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The inactivated X chromosome becomes a Barr body from which few to no genes are expressed (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-glossary-of-terms#H832339165\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics: Glossary of terms&quot;, section on 'X-inactivation'</a>). Barr bodies are visible in a small proportion of neutrophils on the peripheral blood smear of a female.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cellular differentiation</strong> &ndash; Cells differentiate following fertilization to control embryologic development via tightly controlled steps in epigenetic regulation. Epigenetic changes play a role in stem cell programming as well as the differentiation of somatic cells into the specialized cells of the organ in which they reside.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Response to the environment</strong> &ndash; In some cases, environmental changes result in adaptive epigenetic changes. Examples include caloric intake, stress, and toxin exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These responses have been likened to immunologic memory, in that both processes can be induced, may persist for years to decades, may undergo selection pressure and amplification, and may be adaptive or maladaptive, depending on the characteristics of the environment in the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. As a theoretical example, an epigenetic response to famine might improve chances of survival in a resource-poor setting but might lead to obesity and related disorders in a setting with unlimited access to calories.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The sirtuins are a family of proteins that regulate longevity, perhaps mediated by caloric intake. Among other functions, these proteins act as HDACs, and specific histone modifications have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The compound resveratrol may act in part by increasing the affinity of the sirtuin SIRT1 for targets of deacetylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Additional information about the molecular basis of aging is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-aging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal aging&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Additional research into the biology of epigenetically regulated processes may be facilitated by reference human epigenomes such as those generated through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H396146\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF EPIGENETIC CHANGES IN DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epigenetic marks can also contribute to developmental and acquired disorders. Understanding of these effects is evolving, and the full impact of epigenetic changes in human disease is yet to be understood. Epigenetic effects on disease can be challenging to study because many genes may be affected, and it is challenging to determine which effects are causative. In addition, the effects can take years to develop, necessitating high-quality longitudinal data.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H396160\"><span class=\"h2\">Developmental disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) provide a classic example of disorders affected by parentally imprinted genes (see <a href=\"#H396139\" class=\"local\">'Terminology and basic concepts'</a> above). Other, even rarer, examples include Russell-Silver syndrome and genome-wide uniparental disomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. It has also been suggested that parent-of-origin effects may apply to complex disorders such as autism or schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Assisted reproductive technologies may have a small effect on global epigenetic marks, although clinically significant effects have not been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>An example of specific genes that are targeted in PWS and AS are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PWS results from paternal deficiency of the <em>SNORD116-1</em> small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) cluster</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AS results from absence of the maternally inherited copy of the <em>UBE3A</em> gene</p><p/><p>Details of these syndromes and other developmental disorders in which epigenetic changes play a prominent role are discussed in separate UpToDate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and genetics of Prader-Willi syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22#H86261867\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microdeletion syndromes (chromosomes 12 to 22)&quot;, section on '15q11-13 maternal deletion syndrome (Angelman syndrome)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Research on the effects of the prenatal environment on the development of certain conditions such as obesity is ongoing. (See <a href=\"#H396167\" class=\"local\">'Environmental effects on health'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H396167\"><span class=\"h2\">Environmental effects on health</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, epigenetic changes in response to certain environmental exposures can be associated with adverse health conditions (see <a href=\"#H4047230272\" class=\"local\">'Types of processes that are regulated'</a> above), although a causative role has not been definitively established. These exposures may occur prenatally or after birth, and the duration of their effects may last for decades or even into subsequent generations.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Starvation, diabetes, and obesity</strong> &ndash; The availability of adequate nutrients to mothers during prenatal development causes distinct epigenetic changes. Individuals born during famines have also been observed to undergo distinct changes in DNA methylation patterns and histone modifications. These are referred to as transgenerational effects. These changes may occur in response to naturally occurring epigenetic regulators such as butyrates that are induced during starvation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. One target of these changes is the insulin-like growth factor II gene (<em>IGF2</em>), which is maternally imprinted. In a study involving 60 individuals who were conceived during the Dutch Hunger Winter in World War II and studied 60 years later, CpG methylation was reduced compared with sex-matched sibling controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Numerous animal studies support the role for caloric availability in utero on subsequent metabolic effects in offspring. Starvation-induced epigenetic changes have been proposed to lead to &quot;metabolic reprogramming&quot; that is responsible for obesity later in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H396153\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic uses'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-epigenetics/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Paluch BE, Naqash AR, Brumberger Z, et al.
