Many distinct disorders have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Combined immunodeficiency syndromes are a heterogeneous group of disorders arising from a disturbance in the development and function of both T and B cells (cellular and humoral immunity). Combined immunodeficiencies are termed &quot;severe&quot; when they lead to early death from overwhelming infection, typically in the first year of life.</p><p>An overview of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), including clinical manifestations and diagnosis, is presented here. The major combined immunodeficiencies, including multiple causes of SCID, are discussed in detail separately.

The incidence of autosomal recessive SCID is higher in cultures in which consanguineous marriage is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H77711149\" class=\"local\">'SCID classification'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-screening-for-primary-immunodeficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Newborn screening for primary immunodeficiencies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SCID is a syndrome caused by mutations in different genes whose products are crucial for the development and function of both T and B cells. In some cases, the molecular defect results in only T cell deficiency, while B cells are normal. However, serious T cell dysfunction precludes effective humoral immunity since B cells require signals from T cells to produce antibody.</p><p>Natural killer (NK) cells, a non-T, non-B lymphocyte subset exhibiting cytotoxic activities, develop via a pathway distinct from B and T cells. NK cells are present in approximately 50 percent of patients with SCID and may provide a degree of protection against bacterial and viral infections in these patients. Determining the presence or absence of NK cells is also helpful in classifying patients with SCID.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A list of gene defects that cause SCID is presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77724\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77724 \">table 1</a>). A majority of SCID cases are X linked and are due to mutations in <em>IL2RG</em> (gene encoding the interleukin-2 receptor gamma, also called common cytokine receptor gamma chain). All other causes are autosomal recessive in inheritance and are due to mutations in the genes encoding <em>JAK3</em> (Janus kinase 3 gene), <em>IL7RA</em> (interleukin-7 receptor alpha gene), <em>RAG1</em> and <em>RAG2</em> (recombination-activating genes 1 and 2), <em>DCLRE1C</em> (DNA cross-link repair protein 1C gene or Artemis), and <em>ADA</em> (adenosine deaminase gene). Gene defects are unknown in approximately 25 percent of SCID cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77711149\"><span class=\"h1\">SCID CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, SCID syndromes were classified as T-B+NK+, T-B+NK-, T-B-NK+, or T-B-NK- based upon the presence of molecular defects affecting T cells and presence or absence of defects affecting B <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> natural killer (NK) cells, regardless of the functional status of these cells, since genetic diagnosis was more difficult to establish (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77724\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77724 \">table 1</a>). However, the mutated genes responsible for the majority of cases of SCID are known and can be readily determined. Thus, it is more appropriate to refer to SCID according to the specific molecular defect once it is identified.</p><p>SCID and non-SCID combined immunodeficiencies can also be categorized based upon the cellular function of the protein encoded by the defective gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These five functional categories include proteins involved in cytokine signaling, antigen presentation, V(D)J recombination (recombination of the variable, diversity, and joining segments of T cell receptor and immunoglobulin genes), T cell receptor signaling, and basic cellular functions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77023\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77023 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Typical SCID patients have a total T cell (CD3) count of &lt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Leaky SCID refers to combined immunodeficiencies that are often but not always caused by a hypomorphic mutation in a typical SCID gene that allows development of low numbers of usually poorly functioning T cells. These patients have some T cells (300 to 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> and have somewhat milder symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a later presentation compared with those who have full loss of function of the gene product. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic symptoms of SCID are recurrent severe infections, chronic diarrhea, and failure to thrive (FTT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Increased resting energy expenditure (hypermetabolism) is more common in SCID patients with FTT and may contribute to its development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Diagnosis is often delayed by several months since these infants look normal outwardly and maternally derived antibodies provide some protection during a time that the young infant is less likely to be exposed to infection. Physical examination may reveal a focus of infection, such as thrush. In addition, discernible peripheral lymphoid tissue (tonsils, adenoids, <span class=\"nowrap\">axillary/inguinal</span> nodes) may be absent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recognition-of-immunodeficiency-in-the-newborn-period\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recognition of immunodeficiency in the newborn period&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The absence of a thymic shadow on chest radiography is a typical finding in infants with SCID. Thus, a chest radiograph may be useful in the newborn suspected of SCID (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F67690\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67690 \">image 1</a>). However, the presence of a thymic shadow does not rule out SCID, since the thymus may sometimes be visible in rare forms of SCID (eg, coronin 1A and CD3 delta) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, infants who do not have SCID, but who have severe metabolic stress due to serious or overwhelming infection, severe malnutrition, or other severe illness, may have rapid involution of the thymus such that it is no longer apparent on chest radiograph. Nevertheless, an absent thymic shadow warrants an immune evaluation.</p><p>The absence of both specific cellular and humoral immunity in patients with SCID leads to a profound susceptibility to infection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent mucocutaneous candidiasis is a common early finding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections with common viral pathogens, such as adenovirus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), rotavirus, norovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), measles, influenza, and parainfluenza 3, are frequently fatal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opportunistic infections with normally nonpathogenic organisms, such as <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> (formerly <em>carinii</em>) may occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attenuated vaccine organisms, such as oral polio vaccine virus, rotavirus, varicella, and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), may cause severe or fatal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>Patients may also suffer from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transfusion of blood products containing viable lymphocytes can lead to rapidly fatal GVHD.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GVHD may also be caused by transplacental passage of alloreactive maternal T cells.</p><p/><p>Some patients with SCID develop malignancy, and the malignancy may occur before or after stem cell therapy. The estimated overall incidence of cancer in patients with various types of SCID is 1.5 percent, and the most common malignancies are EBV-induced lymphoproliferative disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (74 percent of cases), Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].

Other immunologic abnormalities are seen, but are not critical to the initial evaluation. Laboratory studies necessary to confirm the diagnosis are reviewed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory evaluation of the immune system&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is usually a low absolute lymphocyte count (&lt;2500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span>. The thymus is generally small and devoid of lymphocytes. Occasionally, the absolute lymphocyte count is normal. This can be due to a high number of B cells or to engraftment of transplacentally transferred maternal T cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormalities of lymphocyte subpopulations as determined by flow cytometry may vary depending upon the specific molecular defect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77724\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77724 \">table 1</a>). Autologous CD3 T cells are &lt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. However, the T cell count may be normal or high in some cases due to the presence of maternal T cells in the peripheral circulation or abnormal expansion of a few clones (eg, Omenn syndrome). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T cell mitogen responses are absent or extremely low, and this is one of the most important tests to perform early. Absence of T cell mitogen response is a crucial element in the diagnosis of SCID. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous anergy to recall antigens is universal, but this test is not reliable under one year of age. In vitro tests of T cell antigen response may be used after the infant has been immunized, but the diagnosis of SCID rests largely upon the absence of T cell mitogen response. Thus, testing for antigen response is not usually required in the context of evaluation for SCID.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypogammaglobulinemia is often found, but may be obscured due to the presence of maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the blood in early infancy. Serum levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin E (IgE) are usually very low.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific antibody responses are severely impaired.

Laboratory findings used for these criteria include an absolute CD3 T cell count of &lt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> or maternal T cells in the circulation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients with leaky SCID, which is less severe <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delayed in onset compared with classic SCID, may have up to 1500 T <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> at birth, but these T cells are usually CD45RO+ memory T cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oligoclonal T cells. Leaky SCID is defined as age-adjusted relative T cell lymphopenia (under age two years, &lt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL;</span> age two to four years, &lt;800 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL;</span> age greater than four years, &lt;600 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> and proliferation to mitogens &lt;30 percent of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77711429\"><span class=\"h2\">Detection of maternal T cell engraftment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An infant with any of the above features suggestive of an immunodeficiency, but who has a normal lymphocyte count, should be evaluated for maternal T cell engraftment. In some infants with SCID, maternal T cells that cross the placenta and enter the circulation of a fetus engraft subsequently may expand to levels &gt;8000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. This may cause the total T cell count to appear &quot;normal.&quot; One indicator that maternal T cell engraftment has occurred is a greater predominance of either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells since maternally engrafted cells are oligoclonal. However, this phenotype is not always evident. A majority of the maternally engrafted T cells have an activated or memory phenotype (they express CD45RO). Normal infant T cells are predominantly na&iuml;ve (eg, they express CD45RA). These cell surface markers can be measured on flow cytometry. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;, section on 'Memory T cells'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77710915\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the case of a pregnancy where there is a history of a prior affected child with SCID for which the specific molecular defect is known, a prenatal diagnosis can be made by genetic tests performed on amniotic fluid or chorionic villus cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. If the genetic defect is unknown, flow cytometry assessment of lymphocyte populations in umbilical venous blood may establish a diagnosis. However, there is some risk of fetal loss with both procedures. Thus, they should only be performed if there has been a decision to terminate an affected pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77710935\"><span class=\"h2\">Newborn screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early diagnosis of SCID improves outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>], suggesting that identification of patients through newborn screening will decrease the morbidity and mortality of the disease. A cost-effective method for screening newborns for T cell lymphopenia was identified that uses dried blood spots (DBS) to measure T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) as a biomarker of na&iuml;ve T cells. This method of screening for SCID and other disorders with T cell deficiency was added to the recommended uniform newborn screening panel in the United States in 2010. Newborn screening for primary immunodeficiencies is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-screening-for-primary-immunodeficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Newborn screening for primary immunodeficiencies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extreme malnutrition can have a SCID-like presentation, including opportunistic infection. T cell function quickly normalizes once adequate nutrition is established. Infants with intestinal lymphangiectasia often present with profound lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia and have been mistakenly diagnosed as having SCID. In these patients, there is usually evidence of intestinal protein loss (hypoalbuminemia, elevated stool alpha-1-antitrypsin). Hereditary folate malabsorption due to mutations in the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) gene can also mimic SCID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These patients will have an associated anemia that is not usually seen in SCID. Anemia and immune function respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> (folinic acid) supplementation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes#H2625885\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary immunodeficiency due to underlying disease states, environmental exposures, and miscellaneous causes&quot;, section on 'Intestinal lymphangiectasia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malnutrition in children in resource-limited countries: Clinical assessment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-pathophysiology-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies#H1302653688\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and pathophysiology of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies&quot;, section on 'Genetic disorders (folate)'</a>.)</p><p>Other forms of combined immunodeficiency have many of the elements of the clinical presentation of SCID, including opportunistic infections. Examples include X-linked hyperimmunoglobulin M syndrome (CD40 ligand and CD40 deficiencies), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, NF-kappa-B essential modifier (NEMO) deficiency, zeta-chain associated protein 70 (ZAP-70) deficiency, calcium channel deficiencies, Cernunnos deficiency, complete DiGeorge syndrome, purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency, and Omenn syndrome. These forms of combined immunodeficiency are usually distinguished by distinctive laboratory features and other elements of the clinical presentation. However, in some cases, the distinction between SCID and a non-SCID combined immunodeficiency is only made by molecular testing.

Most patients with adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA) receive HCT; however, some may be treated with enzyme replacement therapy (eg, polyethylene glycol-adenosine deaminase [PEG-ADA]). Gene therapy is another possible alternative that is becoming available for some forms of SCID, such as ADA-SCID and X-linked SCID (common gamma-chain deficiency); this option should be explored if a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical donor is unavailable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adenosine deaminase deficiency: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gene therapy for primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Viral infections are a leading cause of death in patients with SCID and other forms of moderate-to-severe primary immunodeficiencies, both before and particularly in the first several months after HCT before T cell engraftment has occurred. The most commonly implicated viruses are CMV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and adenovirus (ADV). Adoptive immunotherapy with virus-specific T cells (VST) can be used to treat these life-threatening viral infections.</p><p>One retrospective series examined 26 patients with a primary immunodeficiency that required treatment with HCT who had at least one documented serious viral infection and were treated with VST either before (n = 2) or after (n = 24) HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Complete or partial antiviral response was seen in 76 to 100 percent of patients, depending upon the particular virus. Six of the 26 patients had reactivation infections after VST that resolved in one to two months. VST was effective despite the use of immunosuppressive medications in many patients. An additional 10 patients were treated preventively with VST prior to HCT. Of these, eight remained free of EBV, CMV, and ADV infection. Two patients developed viral infections after VST (one with CMV and the other with EBV). Both had complete response to subsequent therapy. Reported adverse reactions to VST were mild. Four cases of graft-versus-host disease were felt to be transplant associated rather than due to VST.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SCID is fatal, usually within the first year of life, unless the underlying defect is corrected.

These disorders are termed &quot;severe&quot; (eg, severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID]) when they lead to early death from overwhelming infection, typically in the first year of life. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the past, SCID syndromes were classified as T-B+NK+, T-B+NK-, T-B-NK+, or T-B-NK- based upon the presence of molecular defects affecting T cells and presence or absence of defects affecting B <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> natural killer (NK) cells, regardless of the functional status of these cells, since genetic diagnosis was more difficult to establish (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77724\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77724 \">table 1</a>). However, the mutated genes responsible for the majority of cases of SCID are known and can be readily determined. Thus, it is more appropriate to refer to SCID according to the specific molecular defect once it is identified. (See <a href=\"#H77711149\" class=\"local\">'SCID classification'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with SCID appear normal at birth and in early infancy. The classic symptoms of SCID are recurrent severe infections, chronic diarrhea, and failure to thrive (FTT). A diagnosis is often not made until the infant develops a severe infection. The thymic shadow is absent on chest radiography in most infants with SCID, and the absolute lymphocyte count is usually very low. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classic SCID is defined as an autologous T cell count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;300/microL</span> together with an in vitro phytohemagglutinin (PHA) response &lt;10 percent of normal or the presence of maternal T cells in the circulation. Leaky SCID is defined as lymphopenia (an autologous T cell count &lt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> under age two years, &lt;800 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> age two to four years, or &lt;600 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> age greater than four years) together with a PHA response &lt;30 percent of normal. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial management includes several protective measures to prevent infection, including isolation from potential sick contacts, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy, and avoidance of live-virus vaccines. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Protective measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common, widely available curative therapy for most forms of SCID is hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).
