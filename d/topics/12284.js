The leukemic cells proliferate in the marrow and interfere with production of normal blood cells, causing weakness, infection, bleeding, and other symptoms and complications. In about half of patients, nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities are found by cytogenetic analysis, and these are used for classification, management, and prognostication. AML is generally rapidly lethal unless treated with intensive chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> targeted therapies together with supportive care. However, AML is occasionally indolent and slowly progressive.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of AML in adults.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>AML is maintained by a pool of self-renewing leukemic stem cells that may be more immature than the bulk population of leukemic cells. They are thought to originate from cells with existing self-renewal capacity (ie, hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells) or from progenitors that have re-acquired this stem cell-like property.

In some cases, the chromosomal translocations generate chimeric fusion genes that are never expressed in normal cells. As an example, in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a chromosomal translocation juxtaposes the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (<em>RARA</em>) locus on chromosome 17 and the promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML) on chromosome 15 to generate the chimeric PML-RARA oncoprotein. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular biology of acute promyelocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, key regulators of cellular growth and differentiation are altered by point mutations and small duplications or deletions of genes that are not detectable on routine karyotyping.

The median age at diagnosis is approximately 65 years, and the incidence increases with age. The male:female ratio is approximately 5:3, and non-Hispanic Whites have a higher incidence than other racial and ethnic groups.

AML has been associated with environmental factors (eg, exposure to chemicals, radiation, tobacco, chemotherapy, retroviruses). In some patients, evolution to AML is preceded by evidence of clonal hematopoiesis manifest as a myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative neoplasms, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, aplastic anemia, or clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate significance.

Possible consolidation approaches may include chemotherapy, autologous or allogeneic HCT, or other therapies.
