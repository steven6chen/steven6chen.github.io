Epidural anesthesia is used for anesthesia of abdominal, pelvic, and lower extremity procedures and, less commonly, thoracic procedures. It may be used to supplement general anesthesia for thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic procedures and for postoperative analgesia following these procedures. The usual technique involves siting a catheter in the epidural space. LA solution and adjuvants are administered through the catheter, both to initiate and maintain anesthesia for the duration of the surgical procedure.</p><p>This topic will discuss the relevant anatomy, techniques, and management of epidural and combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. The technique for spinal anesthesia is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-anesthesia-technique\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal anesthesia: Technique&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neuraxial anesthesia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3128877034\"><span class=\"h1\">SPINAL VERSUS EPIDURAL ANESTHESIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal, epidural, and combined spinal-epidural (CSE) anesthesia can be used for many of the same surgical procedures. Differences among them may affect the choice of technique for a specific procedure or patient. The advantages and disadvantages of the various neuraxial anesthesia techniques are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F110997\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110997 \">table 1</a>). Spinal anesthesia is usually administered as a single shot, whereas epidural anesthesia is usually administered via a catheter (thus it is a continuous technique), and CSE anesthesia combines the two.</p><p>Catheter-based neuraxial anesthesia (ie, epidural, CSE, and continuous spinal) allows prolonged anesthesia and titration of the onset of the anesthetic. Single-shot spinal or epidural anesthesia is limited to the duration of action of the injected drug.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2557425003\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidural anesthesia is performed by introducing a needle between the lumbar, thoracic, or cervical vertebrae and injecting anesthetic medication into the epidural space, via the epidural needle <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a catheter inserted through the needle into the epidural space (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111959\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111959 \">figure 1</a>). Detailed anatomy of the bony spine and vertebrae are discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58088\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58088 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64902\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64902 \">figure 3</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal column injuries in adults: Definitions, mechanisms, and radiographs&quot;, section on 'Anatomy'</a>). This topic will focus on lumbar and thoracic epidural <span class=\"nowrap\">anesthesia/analgesia</span>. Cervical epidural injections are done mostly for pain procedures and are outside the scope of this topic.</p><p>Anatomy related specifically to the performance of epidural anesthesia is discussed here.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Boundaries</strong> &ndash; The epidural space lies between the dural sac and the inside of the bony spinal canal. It extends from the foramen magnum to the sacral hiatus. The posterior longitudinal ligament forms the anterior border, the ligamentum flavum forms the posterior border, and pedicles and intervertebral foramina form the lateral border of the epidural space.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vertebral level</strong> &ndash; Epidural anesthesia is most commonly performed at the lumbar or thoracic vertebral levels and occasionally at the cervical level. The vertebral level for epidural anesthesia is determined by the dermatomal levels of the surgical procedure and the required extent of surgical anesthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Historically, surface landmarks have been used to estimate the vertebral level for epidural needle placement, as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106234\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106234 \">figure 4</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The intercristal line (ie, the line between the posterior superior iliac crests) crosses the body of L4 in most patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The inferior border of the scapula is at T7.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The C7 spinous process is the most prominent among the cervical vertebrae on palpation (vertebra prominens).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Surface landmarks do not accurately predict the vertebral interspaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidural-and-combined-spinal-epidural-anesthesia-techniques/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>], and clinicians are more likely to insert the needle more cephalad than estimated. Preprocedure ultrasound is increasingly being used for vertebral-level estimation, especially in the lumbar region. Data are lacking as to whether precise determination of the interspace before initiation of epidural anesthesia results in improved outcomes and safety.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ligaments</strong> &ndash; Three spinal ligaments are important for the epidural anesthesia technique.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The supraspinous ligament anchors the tips of the spinous processes in a continuous column</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The interspinous ligament stretches between the spinous processes of successive vertebrae</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The ligamentum flavum is a tough ligament that lies deep to the interspinous ligament and forms the posterior border of the epidural space (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106236\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106236 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Contents of the epidural space</strong> &ndash; The epidural space is a discontinuous space, roughly divided into posterior, lateral, and anterior compartments, occupied by nerves, fat, and blood vessels. The anesthetic solution is usually deposited into the posterior epidural space, but it must spread throughout the space to provide effective anesthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nerves and dermatomes</strong> &ndash; The spinal nerves,<strong> </strong>autonomic nerves, and dermatomes relevant for neuraxial anesthesia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-anesthesia-technique#H520190259\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal anesthesia: Technique&quot;, section on 'Anatomy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2286301541\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A medical history and anesthesia-focused physical examination should be performed for all patients who undergo any type of anesthesia; if epidural anesthesia is planned, the spine should also be examined. The preoperative evaluation should focus on medical conditions that may alter the physiologic response to epidural anesthesia or increase the risk of complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neuraxial anesthesia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2877801410\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION FOR EPIDURAL ANESTHESIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For epidural anesthesia, the standard and emergency anesthesia equipment and medications should be prepared as they would be for general anesthesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-induction#H254392428\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Induction&quot;, section on 'Preparation for anesthetic induction'</a>.)</p><p>A disposable epidural kit is usually used. The kit contains needles, an epidural catheter, drugs, labels, and other required equipment. The kit is preferably placed on a cart or table on the side of the clinician's dominant hand.</p><p>Intravenous (IV) access must be secured prior to the procedure. Standard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitors should be applied (eg, noninvasive blood pressure [BP] monitor, electrocardiography, pulse oximetry) prior to initiation of epidural anesthesia. Additional monitoring (eg, intraarterial pressure monitoring) is dictated by the patient's medical status and the planned procedure.</p><p>A preprocedure time-out should be performed, which includes confirmation of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient identifiers (eg, name, medical record number, date of birth)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug allergies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Planned surgical procedure or indication for epidural anesthesia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical and anesthesia consent with site marked, if applicable</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coagulation status (eg, anticoagulant administration, coagulation laboratory values, if applicable)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3032594345\"><span class=\"h2\">Premedication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sedation may be titrated, if necessary, prior to epidural needle placement. Deep sedation should be avoided to allow patient cooperation with positioning and feedback (ie, the occurrence of pain or paresthesia) during the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H849302563\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning for epidural procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like spinal anesthesia, the sitting and lateral decubitus positions are commonly used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106234\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106234 \">figure 4</a>). Success rate is similar between the sitting and the lateral decubitus position, although the insertion time may be shorter in the sitting position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidural-and-combined-spinal-epidural-anesthesia-techniques/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The goal of positioning is to create a straight path for the needle insertion between the superior and inferior vertebral spinous processes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106238\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106238 \">figure 6</a>) and to avoid rotation of the spine. Commercial devices are available that are designed to support the patient in the sitting position during neuraxial block (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106230\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106230 \">figure 7</a>). Positioning is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-anesthesia-technique#H520190587\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal anesthesia: Technique&quot;, section on 'Positioning for spinal procedure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175011156\"><span class=\"h2\">Preprocedure ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preprocedure ultrasound scanning of the spine may be useful in identifying the intervertebral space for needle placement and an estimation of the depth required to reach the epidural space. Ultrasound can be particularly useful in obese patients or patients with altered anatomy in whom the traditional surface landmarks are vague or difficult to identify [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidural-and-combined-spinal-epidural-anesthesia-techniques/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-anesthesia-technique#H520190675\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal anesthesia: Technique&quot;, section on 'Preprocedure ultrasonography'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H666526856\"><span class=\"h2\">Aseptic technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Strict aseptic technique must be used for all aspects of the epidural anesthesia procedure. Aseptic technique for neuraxial anesthesia is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-anesthesia-technique#H520190735\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal anesthesia: Technique&quot;, section on 'Aseptic technique'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1395861715\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDURAL ANESTHESIA TECHNIQUE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4071516609\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidural anesthesia equipment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epidural needles</strong> &ndash; In an adult epidural kit, the epidural needle is typically 17- or 18-gauge and 8.89 cm (3.5 inches) in length, with surface markings at 1-cm intervals. Longer needles up to 15 cm (6 inches) in length are available for morbidly obese patients. Many commercially available epidural needles, including the Hustead, Weiss, and Tuohy needles, have a curved opening at the tip to guide the catheter into the epidural space. Wings at the junction of the needle shaft and hub may allow for better control as the needle is passed through tissue, although some practitioners may prefer epidural needles without wings or with attachable wings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Loss of resistance</strong> &ndash; The loss-of-resistance (LOR) syringe is a special syringe that is used to identify the epidural space, with low resistance between the plunger and the inside of the needle barrel. The syringe is filled with saline, air, or a combination of the two and attached to the epidural needle when the needle tip is engaged in the interspinous ligament. As the needle is advanced with pressure on the plunger, LOR occurs once the needle tip is advanced beyond the ligament into the epidural space. (See <a href=\"#H3761002793\" class=\"local\">'Midline approach technique'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Historically, glass syringes with a ground-glass barrel and plunger have been used, but low-resistance plastic syringes are now available for this purpose, and the choice between plastic and glass is a matter of clinician preference. The authors prefer to use a glass LOR syringe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The choice of saline, air, or both for LOR is also a matter of personal preference. A Cochrane database systematic review reported no difference between using air or saline for LOR in identifying the epidural space and no difference in rate of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidural-and-combined-spinal-epidural-anesthesia-techniques/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, the studies included in the review primarily included obstetric patients so may not be applicable to the general population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epidural catheter</strong> &ndash; A variety of epidural catheters are available. Distinguishing features include the degree of stiffness and tip design. Flexible designs have an embedded stainless steel wire coil (reinforced) surrounded by either a polyurethane or a nylon-blend catheter, depending on the manufacturer. Nylon catheters without the spring-wound inner coil tend to be stiffer. Catheter tip designs differ in the number and arrangement of orifices (multi-orifice versus single end-hole) and flexibility of tip (flexible versus blunt) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F113619\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113619 \">figure 8</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stiff catheters may be easier to thread, but more flexible catheters may reduce the incidence of paresthesia, catheter migration, and intravascular cannulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidural-and-combined-spinal-epidural-anesthesia-techniques/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Several studies have reported reduced incidence of inadequate analgesia with multi-orifice catheters compared with single-orifice catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidural-and-combined-spinal-epidural-anesthesia-techniques/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. In contrast, one randomized study that compared uniport and multiport versions of flexible, wire-reinforced catheters for labor analgesia reported no difference in the success of analgesia, breakthrough pain, or occurrence of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidural-and-combined-spinal-epidural-anesthesia-techniques/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>It may be easier to aspirate blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from a multi-orifice catheter that is malpositioned in a blood vessel or intrathecal space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidural-and-combined-spinal-epidural-anesthesia-techniques/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The individual orifices of a multi-orifice catheter may reside in different compartments simultaneously (eg, epidural and subarachnoid) and could theoretically result in only partial placement of the drug in the intended space.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, choice of epidural catheter is a matter of clinician and institutional preference. Epidural catheters are marked at 1-cm intervals, so the depth of its insertion can be easily determined.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H181324762\"><span class=\"h2\">Approaches to the epidural space</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epidural needle can be inserted using a midline or a paramedian approach. Lumbar and lower thoracic epidural catheters are usually sited via a midline approach; the paramedian approach is more commonly used for the mid- to high-thoracic insertions. The epidural needle is advanced through skin, soft tissue, and spinal ligaments until the tip of the epidural needle enters the epidural space. This is recognized by so-called &quot;loss of resistance&quot; (LOR). When the needle tip is located in spinal ligaments, the contents of the syringe are difficult to inject. When the needle tip enters the epidural space, the resistance to injection is lost and the syringe contents (air <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> saline) are easily injected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3761002793\"><span class=\"h3\">Midline approach technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epidural needle is inserted in the midline of the patient's back, defined by the spinous processes. The procedure is performed as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpate the interspace between two spinous processes at the chosen spinal level. Raise a skin wheal with 1% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> using a 25-gauge needle in the midline of the spine, in the lower third to half of the interspace. Infiltrate the subcutaneous tissue with lidocaine and continue through supraspinous ligament down to the interspinous ligament.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert the styletted epidural needle at a straight or slight cephalad angle (if in the lumbar or lower thoracic spine) or at steeper cephalad angle (if in the mid-thoracic spine) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64902\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64902 \">figure 3</a>). The needle bevel is oriented cephalad whether the patient is in a supine or lateral decubitus position. Advance the needle through the supraspinous ligament and into the interspinous ligament (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111959\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111959 \">figure 1</a>). A firmness in the tissue suggests that the tip of the needle is in the supraspinous or intraspinous ligament. Lack of firmness may indicate a paraspinous position of the needle tip, and the needle should be adjusted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the needle tip is anchored in the interspinous ligament, remove the stylet and attach an LOR syringe containing air, saline, or some of each. Apply intermittent or continuous gentle pressure to the plunger with the dominant thumb, while advancing the needle slowly with the nondominant hand (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F113038\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113038 \">figure 9</a>). The ligamentum flavum is a tougher structure than the intraspinous ligament and is identified by increased resistance to injection as the needle is advanced. Once LOR occurs, stop needle advancement to avoid an unintentional dural puncture. The tip of the epidural needle is now located in the epidural space.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small amount of air (1 to 2 mL) may be injected into the epidural space if air is used for the LOR technique. Avoid injecting larger amounts of air as this may contribute to patchy anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidural-and-combined-spinal-epidural-anesthesia-techniques/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injection of 5 to 10 mL of saline before epidural catheter insertion may reduce the risk of vascular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidural-and-combined-spinal-epidural-anesthesia-techniques/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This can be performed after LOR is obtained with air or saline.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3475471297\"><span class=\"h3\">Paramedian approach technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The paramedian approach is often used for mid- to high-thoracic epidural anesthesia. The angulation of the spinous processes in the thoracic spine and the narrow interspaces make the midline approach more technically difficult. This approach is also useful in patients who are unable to flex the spine for lumbar epidural anesthesia or when the midline technique is unsuccessful. It requires mental triangulation in three planes and is thus more difficult to learn.</p><p>With the paramedian approach, the needle does not traverse the interspinous ligament, so minimal resistance to injection occurs as the needle is advanced until the needle tip is engaged in the ligamentum flavum.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpate the interspace between two spinous processes at the chosen spinal level. With a 25-gauge needle, raise a skin wheal with 1% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 1 cm lateral to the midline at the cephalad border of the inferior spinous process. Infiltrate the subcutaneous tissue with lidocaine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following technique for paramedian needle insertion is shown in a figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F113032\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113032 \">figure 10</a>). Insert the epidural needle 1 cm lateral to the cephalad border of the inferior spinous process. Advance the needle perpendicular to the skin until the tip contacts the lamina of the vertebral body below the intended interlaminar space. This helps to estimate the depth of the epidural space. Withdraw the needle slightly, and redirect the tip approximately 15 degrees medially and 45 degrees cephalad. Advance the needle, walking the tip off the edge of the lamina. Stop needle advancement as soon as the ligamentum flavum is felt.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attach the LOR syringe, and gently depress the plunger. Resistance to injection indicates that the needle tip is engaged in the ligamentum flavum. Advance the needle and syringe; once LOR occurs, stop needle advancement to avoid a dural puncture.</p><p/><p>For both the midline and paramedian approaches, the depth of the epidural space from the skin depends on body habitus, vertebral level of insertion, and the angle of the epidural needle. In the average adult, the depth ranges from 4 to 5 cm in the mid-lumbar spine and 4 to 6 cm in the mid-thoracic spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidural-and-combined-spinal-epidural-anesthesia-techniques/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2055188567\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidural catheter placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some clinicians inject anesthetic solution directly through the epidural needle into the epidural space, but more commonly, a catheter is inserted into the space and anesthetic solution is administered via the catheter. After LOR confirms that the tip of the epidural needle is in the epidural space, insert the epidural catheter as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the LOR syringe, and count the markings on the visible shaft of the epidural needle to calculate the depth of the epidural space from the skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thread the epidural catheter through the needle until the 20 cm mark is at the needle hub. Resistance to catheter advancement may be encountered as it reaches the curve at the tip of the needle; however, applying steady pressure on the catheter will usually result in passage into the epidural space.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carefully remove the needle over the catheter, making sure to avoid pulling the catheter back with the needle. Note the mark on the catheter at the skin, and withdraw the catheter to leave 4 to 6 cm in the epidural space (eg, if the epidural space was 5 cm from the skin, the catheter mark at the skin should be 9 to 11 cm).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The optimal length the catheter should be inserted in the epidural space is debated among anesthesiologists. The catheter should be inserted far enough to avoid dislodgement with patient movement and to make sure that all of the catheter orifices are in the epidural space. However, inserting the catheter too far may increase the chance of threading the catheter tip out of the epidural space. In laboring obstetric patients, insertion of a lumbar epidural catheter &le;3 cm in the epidural space increases the risk of dislodgement and insufficient analgesia, whereas length &ge;7 cm is associated with catheter malposition and unilateral analgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidural-and-combined-spinal-epidural-anesthesia-techniques/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. In one study of thoracic epidural analgesia for thoracotomy, there were no differences in pain scores or nonfunctioning epidurals for patients who were randomly assigned to catheter-threading distances of 3, 5, and 7 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidural-and-combined-spinal-epidural-anesthesia-techniques/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attach the catheter connector; hold the catheter tip below the insertion site and confirm that there is no CSF or blood flow from the catheter, which would indicate intrathecal or intravascular catheter placement. Attach a 3-mL syringe and aspirate gently, again to confirm absence of CSF or blood return.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place a transparent, occlusive, sterile dressing over the catheter insertion site, and tape the catheter securely to the patient's back, usually to the shoulder. When the epidural is placed in the sitting position, it may be preferable to secure the catheter after placing the patient in the lateral decubitus position, particularly in heavier patients. Catheters may move inward into the subcutaneous tissue as the patient moves from the flexed to the extended position; as such, we wait to secure the catheter with the dressing until the back is no longer flexed. The site of catheter insertion at the skin should remain visible.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2456517758\"><span class=\"h2\">Troubleshooting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several common problems may occur when placing an epidural needle or catheter.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Difficulty locating the epidural space</strong> &ndash; If the needle hits bone during epidural needle placement, the clinician should first consider what part of the vertebra is being contacted. If bone is contacted within 1 to 2 cm of the skin, contact is likely being made with the tip of the spinous process. If contact is deeper (2 to 3 cm), the side of the spinous process is likely being contacted. If contact is made yet deeper (&gt;4 cm), the lamina is likely being contacted. The patient may be asked if <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> perceives the needle on the left or right side. The clinician should use this information to assess the location of the needle tip and the actions necessary to move the needle from its current location to the desired location (interlaminar space). Usually, an attempt is made to &quot;walk&quot; the needle off the bone. The needle is withdrawn approximately 0.5 to 1.0 cm and then readvanced with the tip of the needle directed slightly more cephalad and toward the midline (if the needle is perceived by the patient to be on the left or right side).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The epidural needle may become occluded with a bony fragment or tissue due to contact with bone. LOR will not be appreciated, and dural puncture may occur if the needle is advanced. If an occluded needle is suspected, the stylet should be reinserted to clear the needle, or the needle should be removed and flushed with saline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>&quot;False&quot; LOR</strong> &ndash; False LOR (residence to injection is lost, but the epidural needle tip is not in the epidural space) can occur when there is a loose connection between the LOR syringe and epidural needle, therefore allowing leakage of saline or air as pressure is applied to the syringe plunger. A false LOR may also occur if the epidural needle enters the interspinous ligament at an oblique angle and exits the ligament into soft tissue on the opposite side. Methods suggested for identifying a false LOR include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Add a small amount of air (0.5 mL) to the saline in the LOR syringe, and inject a small amount of saline through the needle. The air bubble will compress because of tissue resistance if the needle tip is in soft tissue, whereas it will not compress if the needle tip is in the epidural space.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pass a long spinal needle through the epidural needle. If dural puncture occurs (ie, CSF return into the spinal needle hub), the tip of the epidural needle is likely to be in the epidural space.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Difficulty threading the epidural catheter into the epidural space</strong> &ndash; If resistance is encountered when advancing the catheter into the epidural space, it may indicate that the epidural needle tip is not in the epidural space, and the needle should be removed and repositioned. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the clinician is convinced that the needle tip is in the epidural space and the catheter does not advance beyond the needle tip, we do not recommend rotating the needle, as this increases the risk of inadvertent dural puncture. Several maneuvers have been described to overcome the problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>The simplest is to ask the patient to take a deep breath while the clinician maintains gentle pressure on the epidural catheter. In one study, epiduroscopy demonstrated that this maneuver &quot;opened&quot; the space at the needle tip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidural-and-combined-spinal-epidural-anesthesia-techniques/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Reinsertion of the epidural needle at a steeper angle may facilitate advancement of the catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidural-and-combined-spinal-epidural-anesthesia-techniques/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This is best achieved by withdrawing the epidural needle 0.5 to 1.0 cm, reattaching the LOR syringe, and re-advancing at a steeper angle by applying downward pressure to the hub of the needle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Alternatively, approximately 5 mL of saline may be injected through the needle into the epidural space and the catheter reinserted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If resistance to threading the epidural catheter occurs after advancing the catheter beyond the tip of the epidural needle (indicated by the centimeter calibration on the catheter), the catheter and the needle must be withdrawn together and the procedure started anew. There is a risk of shearing off the catheter tip if it is withdrawn through the needle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Paresthesias during needle or catheter placement</strong> &ndash; If the patient complains of paresthesias during needle or catheter advancement, further advancement should stop.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If paresthesias occur during needle placement, the needle should be withdrawn and repositioned at a different angle towards the midline, away from the side of the paresthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Transient paresthesias are common during epidural catheter placement. If a paresthesia resolves, the catheter can be advanced. If the paresthesia recurs, the needle and catheter should be withdrawn and the procedure repeated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood in the epidural needle or catheter</strong> &ndash; The epidural needle may puncture a blood vessel either in the soft tissue or in the epidural space as it is advanced. The needle should be removed, flushed with saline, and readvanced at a different angle through the same or a different puncture site. Clotted blood may occlude the epidural needle, prevent LOR, and increase the risk of unintentional dural puncture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Unintentional dural puncture</strong> &ndash; Unintentional dural puncture may be recognized at the time of epidural needle advancement or after threading the epidural catheter. CSF can flow into the LOR syringe from the hub of the epidural needle or from the proximal end of the catheter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Further management after unintentional dural puncture depends on the clinical situation and provider preference. There are two management options for neuraxial anesthesia after unintentional dural puncture:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Remove and replace the epidural needle and catheter at a different interspace, or</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For lumbar neuraxial anesthesia, place or leave the catheter in the subarachnoid space and proceed with continuous spinal anesthesia. An intrathecal catheter should not be left in place after unintentional dural puncture in the thoracic spine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Advantages and disadvantages of these options are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F113034\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113034 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p>If postoperative neuraxial analgesia is planned, the epidural should be replaced at another interspace. Although continuous spinal analgesia is possible, it is generally not advised because of the risk of drug-dosing errors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2777128275\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidural test dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale for administering an epidural test dose is to determine whether the epidural catheter has been unintentionally placed in an epidural vein or the subarachnoid space. The unintentional subarachnoid injection of an epidural dose of local anesthetic (LA) could result in high or total spinal anesthesia, while an unintentional intravenous (IV) injection could cause LA systemic toxicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity#H2907251082\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Local anesthetic systemic toxicity&quot;, section on 'Local anesthetic dose'</a>.)</p><p>While a negative epidural test dose does not eliminate the possibility that the epidural catheter is malpositioned in a vein or the subarachnoid space, it improves the safety of epidural anesthesia.</p><p>The most commonly used test dose (and the one used by the authors) consists of 3 mL of 1.5% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> (1:200,000). The onset of acute tachycardia within one minute or dense motor block within five minutes constitutes a &quot;positive&quot; test dose. The LA dose used should be adequate to cause spinal anesthesia if injected in the subarachnoid space but not so large as to cause high or total spinal anesthesia. An increase in heart rate of 20 to 30 beats per minute is usually observed after 20 to 40 seconds following an intravenous injection of epinephrine 15 mcg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidural-and-combined-spinal-epidural-anesthesia-techniques/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroprocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Chloroprocaine</a> is the only LA that can be used alone (without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>) as a single test dose to rule out both intravascular and intrathecal injection. Intravascular chloroprocaine 90 mg will cause subtoxic symptoms of LA systemic toxicity (eg, tinnitus, circumoral paresthesias) in the unpremedicated patient, and intrathecal injection will result in spinal anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidural-and-combined-spinal-epidural-anesthesia-techniques/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The use of an epidural test dose in obstetrics is discussed separately.

The most common CSE technique is a needle-through-needle technique, which involves siting the tip of an epidural needle in the epidural space, followed by insertion of a long spinal needle through the epidural needle to inject spinal drugs, followed by removal of the spinal needle and threading of the epidural catheter in the normal fashion. Alternatively, an epidural catheter may be placed, after which a spinal anesthetic is performed at a more caudal interspace. The technique for needle-through-needle CSE is described here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3998518015\"><span class=\"h2\">CSE equipment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combined spinal-epidural (CSE) is usually performed with a standard epidural needle and a long spinal needle. Specialized equipment is also available, including a double-lumen epidural needle, an epidural needle with a separate hole for the spinal needle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidural-and-combined-spinal-epidural-anesthesia-techniques/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], <span class=\"nowrap\">and&nbsp;epidural/spinal&nbsp;needle</span> sets with hubs that lock together.</p><p>Typically, an approximately 4.7- to 5-inch (119- to 127-mm), small-gauge, pencil-point spinal needle (ie, 25- to 27-gauge) is used with a standard 8.89-cm (3.5-inch) epidural needle. In the rare instance in which a longer epidural needle is used, an even longer spinal needle is required. When the spinal needle hub is inserted up to the epidural needle hub, the spinal needle should protrude beyond the tip of the epidural needle 12 to 15 mm. A standard epidural catheter is threaded.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3955878760\"><span class=\"h2\">CSE technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As for single-shot spinal anesthesia, combined spinal-epidural (CSE) is performed below the L2 to L3 interspace to avoid puncturing the spinal cord.

Slight resistance may be felt as a 25-gauge spinal needle exits the epidural needle. Advance the needle several millimeters, stopping if a pop or give is felt as the spinal needle punctures the dura and arachnoid membranes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grasp the spinal and epidural needle hubs securely in the nondominant hand to prevent spinal needle movement, and remove the spinal needle stylet with the dominant hand to check for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow. If there is no flow, replace the stylet and continue to advance the spinal needle, stopping again when a pop is felt. If neither a &quot;dural pop&quot; nor CSF is appreciated, then the epidural needle is most likely in the lateral epidural space, left or right of midline, or not in the epidural space at all. Alternatively, the spinal needle may not protrude far enough beyond the epidural needle to reach the dura, although this is unlikely. In either case, the epidural and spinal needle can be withdrawn and the procedure can be repeated at the same or at a different interspace, or the spinal portion can be abandoned and the epidural catheter can be inserted. If the catheter does not thread easily into the epidural space, the epidural needle should be removed and the procedure attempted from a different angle or at a different interspace.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If CSF flows freely from the spinal needle, attach the spinal syringe and inject the intrathecal medication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We do not routinely aspirate for CSF before injection during a labor CSE, but practice varies, and it may be helpful in certain situations. Considerations regarding aspiration through the spinal needle in this setting include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Aspiration may increase the risk of spinal needle dislodgement but can also re-confirm correct spinal needle location if dislodgement is suspected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Aspiration prior to injection can help confirm that drugs are deposited in the subarachnoid space (this is not necessary for labor analgesia but may be beneficial during spinal anesthesia for operative delivery or other surgeries).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>CSF flow may be slow if a 27-gauge spinal needle is used or if the procedure is performed in the lateral position. In some cases, CSF cannot be aspirated, despite having the spinal needle tip sited correctly in the subarachnoid space. As long as CSF drips from the spinal needle, spinal drug solution can be injected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the spinal injection is complete, repeat aspiration may be helpful to confirm that the entire spinal dose was deposited in the subarachnoid space.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the spinal needle and syringe together, leaving the epidural needle in place.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert the epidural catheter, attach the catheter connector, aspirate to confirm the absence of CSF or blood return, and apply a dressing.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1331565023\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose of spinal drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are various options for management of CSE anesthesia initiated for surgery, including administration of a full dose of spinal drug (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108422 \">table 3</a>), followed by epidural medication as necessary, or administration of a partial spinal dose (ie, sequential CSE) with epidural administration to achieve adequate surgical anesthesia.

Thus, the technique may be particularly useful for patients at high risk for hypotension or at high risk for complications of hypotension.

Waiting until sensory blockade begins to regress will result in breakthrough pain and is typically avoided.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bolus dosing</strong> &ndash; Typically, approximately one-half the original epidural dose of LA is injected incrementally (ie, 3 to 5 mL increments) at regular intervals (45 to 60 minutes for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> and 90 to 120 minutes for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a>) to maintain anesthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infusion</strong> &ndash; Epidural anesthesia may be maintained with a continuous infusion, typically a mixture of a long-acting LA (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> 0.5%, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a> 0.75%, or levobupivacaine 0.75%) with or without an opioid (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> 2 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> at 4 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span>. </p><p/><p>If the patient experiences breakthrough pain during the surgical procedure, additional LA (and appropriate adjuvants) should be immediately injected through the epidural catheter to reestablish anesthesia.</p><p>Patients who receive combined general-epidural anesthesia are unable to complain of symptoms of impending local anesthetic systemic toxicity or total spinal anesthesia. Therefore, epidural drugs should be injected slowly, incrementally, and cautiously while observing for signs of toxicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2716613540\"><span class=\"h2\">Sedation during epidural anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sedation is administered as required and depending on the clinical setting. This is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-anesthesia-technique#H520191907\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal anesthesia: Technique&quot;, section on 'Sedation during spinal anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1645778215\"><span class=\"h2\">Recovery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should recover in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) or recovery room after epidural anesthesia. In most cases after a surgical level of epidural anesthesia, the anesthetic is still in effect when the patient arrives in the PACU; BP must be measured frequently until stabilization and must be again increased in frequency with epidural bolus injection or significant increase in infusion rate. In stable patients, discharge from the PACU is safe after the sensory level of anesthesia has begun to regress.</p><p>When the epidural catheter is removed, the tip should be checked to make sure that it is intact and the catheter has been completely removed. If the catheter does not slide out with gentle traction, repositioning the patient as for epidural placement may help.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H930240720\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDURAL ANALGESIA FOR POSTOPERATIVE PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidural analgesia is often used for postoperative analgesia in patients who have had epidural anesthesia. Typically, the patient is transported to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), and the epidural catheter is connected to an epidural infusion pump (eg, patient-controlled epidural analgesia [PCEA] pump) containing a low-concentration local anesthetic <span class=\"nowrap\">(LA)/opioid</span> solution. A bolus dose is usually not necessary in patients with already established epidural block. The PCEA protocol is initiated as soon as the patient is stable.</p><p>An epidural catheter may be placed in the immediate preoperative period with the plan for postoperative epidural analgesia but not intraoperative epidural anesthesia. A test dose should be administered at the time the catheter is inserted or just prior to initiation of epidural dosing (in cases where an epidural is placed preoperatively but not used until the postoperative period). There are a number of options for initiating postoperative analgesia in this setting. Two of them that we commonly use are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An epidural infusion of a dilute <span class=\"nowrap\">LA/opioid</span> solution may be initiated several hours before the end of the surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bolus of dilute <span class=\"nowrap\">LA/opioid</span> solution may be administered around the time of skin closure, anticipating onset of analgesia shortly before the patient emerges from general anesthesia.</p><p/><p>With either technique, if analgesia is not satisfactory on emergence from general anesthesia, an additional bolus dose of the analgesic solution should be administered. The PCEA protocol is then initiated once the patient arrives in the PACU and is stable. If single-shot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> is planned for postoperative analgesia, epidural injection should be timed to anticipate emergence from general or epidural anesthesia.</p><p>Examples of solutions and doses used for postoperative epidural analgesia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>0.1% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> with 2 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> or 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> at 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>0.0625% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> with 2 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> or 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> at 8 to 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>0.2% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a> with 2 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> at 5 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span></p><p/><p>Doses on the low end of the above ranges should be used for thoracic epidural, especially high-thoracic epidural, and in older patients.</p><p>All the mixtures listed can also be administered as a PCEA with varying bolus doses and lockout interval depending on the clinical setting.
