This defect accounts for approximately 7 to 10 percent of cases of congenital heart disease and is one of the most common congenital heart lesions requiring intervention in the first year of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-tetralogy-of-fallot/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

What is recognized is that during development, there is anterior and cephalad deviation of the infundibular septum. This results in a malaligned ventricular septal defect (VSD), with the aortic root overriding the defect and leading to subsequent right ventricular outflow obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82493\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82493 \">figure 1</a>). The ensuing right ventricular hypertrophy is thought to be a response to the large VSD and right ventricular outflow obstruction with resultant systemic right ventricular systolic pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2053890\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventricular septal defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The VSD in TOF is most commonly a single large malaligned subaortic defect located in the perimembranous region of the septum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52641\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52641 \">image 1</a>). The VSD can extend into the muscular septum. There are rarely other muscular ventricular septal defects.

There may also be further obstruction at the branch pulmonary arteries. These may be diffusely hypoplastic or have focal areas of stenosis, most commonly at the proximal branch pulmonary arteries. The proximal left pulmonary artery near the site of ductal insertion is a frequent location for stenosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64416%7ECARD%2F78255\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64416 graphicRef78255 \">image 3A-B</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2053902\"><span class=\"h2\">Overriding aorta</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overriding aorta is a congenital anomaly, in which the aorta is displaced to the right over the VSD rather than the left ventricle. This results in blood flow from both ventricles into the aorta.</p><p>The degree of aortic override of the VSD can vary widely and is one of the major factors used by some groups to differentiate between TOF and double outlet right ventricle. If one defines double outlet right ventricle as the absence of <span class=\"nowrap\">aortic/mitral</span> valve fibrous continuity, then the degree of override is not relevant to diagnosis. If, however, one defines double outlet right ventricle as a condition with greater than 50 percent aortic override, then, by definition, the degree of aortic override in TOF is limited.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2053908\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated cardiac features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of frequently associated anatomic features that are important to look for when evaluating a patient with TOF, since they affect therapy.

Since the VSD is typically large and unrestrictive, the pressure in the right ventricle reflects that of the left ventricle. As a result, the direction of blood flow across the VSD will be determined by the path of least resistance for blood flow, not by the size of the VSD. If the resistance to blood flow across the obstructed right ventricular outflow tract is less than the resistance to flow out of the aorta into the systemic circulation, blood will naturally shunt from the left ventricle to the right ventricle and into the pulmonary bed. In this situation, there is predominately a left-to-right shunt and the patient will be acyanotic.</p><p>As the degree of right ventricular outflow obstruction increases, the resistance to blood flow into the pulmonary bed also increases. If the right ventricular obstruction is significant enough to increase resistance, it will be easier for blood to cross the VSD from the right ventricle into the left ventricle and go out the aorta, which now becomes the path of least resistance. This right-to-left shunt across the VSD results in a large volume of desaturated blood entering the systemic circulation causing cyanosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82493\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82493 \">figure 1</a>). In patients with unrepaired TOF, chronic cyanosis can result in erythrocythemia.</p><p>One of the physiologic characteristics of TOF is that the right ventricular outflow obstruction can fluctuate. An individual with minimal cyanosis can develop a dynamic increase in right ventricular outflow tract obstruction with a subsequent increase in right-to-left shunt and the development of cyanosis. In the most dramatic situation, there can be near occlusion of the right ventricular outflow tract with profound cyanosis. These episodes are often referred to as &quot;tet spells&quot; or &quot;hypercyanotic spells.&quot; The exact etiology of these episodes is unclear, although there have been a number of proposed mechanisms, including increased infundibular contractility, peripheral vasodilatation, hyperventilation, and stimulation of right ventricular mechanoreceptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-tetralogy-of-fallot/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2053926\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3792923580\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of the patient with TOF is dependent upon the degree of right ventricular outflow obstruction:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with severe obstruction and inadequate pulmonary flow typically present in the immediate newborn period with profound cyanosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with moderate obstruction and balanced pulmonary and systemic flow may be noticed during elective evaluation for a murmur. These children may also present with hypercyanotic (&quot;tet&quot;) spells when RVOT is obstructed during periods of agitation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with minimal obstruction may present with pulmonary overcirculation and heart failure.</p><p/><p>In addition, some affected newborns will be detected by an evaluation prompted by a failed pulse oximetry screening test. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-using-pulse-oximetry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Newborn screening for critical congenital heart disease using pulse oximetry&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most children with TOF are symptomatic and cyanotic; there is a subgroup, however, with typical morphology and hemodynamics that remains clinically asymptomatic for a period of time (pink variant). In general, the earlier the onset of systemic hypoxemia, the more likely it is that severe pulmonary outflow tract stenosis or atresia is present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2053932\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On inspection, individuals with TOF are usually comfortable and in no distress. However, during hypercyanotic (tet) spells, they will become hyperpneic, and infants will often become agitated. If cyanosis is present, it is most easily seen in the nail beds and lips.</p><p>On palpation, one may appreciate a prominent right ventricular impulse and occasionally a systolic thrill. Hepatomegaly is uncommon. Peripheral pulses are usually normal, although the presence of prominent pulses may suggest the existence of a significant patent ductus arteriosus or aorticopulmonary collaterals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2053938\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac auscultation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On auscultation, the first heart sound is normal, and the second heart sound is most commonly single because the pulmonic component is rarely audible. Third and fourth heart sounds are uncommon. An early systolic click along the left sternal border may be heard, which is thought to be due to flow into the dilated ascending aorta. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-a-cardiac-murmur#H14181627\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the infant or child with a cardiac murmur&quot;, section on 'Heart sounds'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2053944\"><span class=\"h3\">Murmur</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The murmur in TOF is due primarily to the right ventricular outflow obstruction, not the VSD. The murmur is typically crescendo-decrescendo with a harsh systolic ejection quality; it is appreciated best along the left mid to upper sternal border with radiation posteriorly. It can, however, have a more regurgitant quality that can be easily mistaken for a VSD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-a-cardiac-murmur\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the infant or child with a cardiac murmur&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The murmur is due both to the degree of obstruction and to the amount of flow across the obstruction. In TOF, unlike isolated valvar pulmonary stenosis, the amount of flow across the right ventricular outflow tract will decrease as the obstruction increases, due to the shunting of blood right-to-left across the VSD. Thus, as the obstruction increases, the murmur will become softer. During severe hypercyanotic (&quot;tet&quot;) spells, the murmur may actually disappear due to the markedly diminished flow across the obstruction.

Other tests that are often performed during the evaluation of TOF include electrocardiogram and chest radiography. Findings from these studies are often suggestive but not conclusive for the diagnosis of TOF. Cardiac catheterization is sometimes needed to further delineate anatomy and hemodynamic changes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4092707668\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Improvements in prenatal screening and fetal echocardiography have led to an increase in prenatal diagnosis of TOF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-tetralogy-of-fallot/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Fetal diagnosis allows for advanced planning for delivery and perinatal management, which is particularly important if there is evidence of severe right ventricular outflow tract obstruction necessitating prostaglandin therapy to maintain ductal patency. The approach to screening, evaluation, and pregnancy management of suspected fetal cardiac abnormalities is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal cardiac abnormalities: Screening, evaluation, and pregnancy management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2053956\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two-dimensional echocardiography and Doppler examination allow assessment of all essential features of TOF and have a crucial role in diagnosis and preoperative evaluation. Complete echocardiographic evaluation may obviate the need for other imaging or diagnostic studies before surgical repair. Most of the information can be achieved with transthoracic echocardiography, but occasionally transesophageal echocardiography may be helpful for specific questions raised with transthoracic echocardiography. A complete study must address:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The location and number of VSDs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anatomy and severity of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The coronary artery and aortic arch anatomy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of any associated anomalies</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2053962\"><span class=\"h3\">Ventricular septal defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The characteristic large malaligned VSD must be evaluated in multiple views. The degree of aortic override can be best assessed in parasternal long axis and apical views (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71450\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef71450 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79575\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef79575 \">movie 2</a>). The extension of the defect from the membranous septum, beneath the tricuspid valve, and into the infracristal outlet septum is well seen in the parasternal short axis view; extension into the supracristal region, if present, can be seen in this view as well (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73954\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef73954 \">movie 3</a>). Potential extension of the defect posteriorly toward the inlet septum, or apically into the trabecular septum, can be examined in apical views; the transducer is swept through serial imaging planes from the more caudal views of the inlet septum to the anteriorly angulated views, showing the overriding aorta in continuity with both the mitral and tricuspid valves.</p><p>The subcostal views are also helpful to delineate the bounds of the VSD, allowing particularly good representation of the relationship between the defect and the tricuspid and aortic valves. The subcostal right oblique view, obtained by rotating the transducer counterclockwise from the coronal views, is also helpful in identifying any potential extension of the defect into the supracristal region. In the rare cases of restrictive VSD in this lesion, this view also defines abnormal tricuspid valve attachments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-tetralogy-of-fallot/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2053968\"><span class=\"h3\">Right ventricular outflow obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The multiple levels and severity of obstruction in the right ventricular outflow tract can also be evaluated by echocardiography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53046\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53046 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64797\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef64797 \">movie 4</a>). Parasternal short axis and subcostal coronal and sagittal views allow the best examination of the infundibulum and pulmonary valve. These views demonstrate the anterior deviation of the conal septum and the infundibular muscle bundles that contribute to infundibular obstruction. The size of the usually hypoplastic pulmonary annulus can be assessed and compared with normal values for patient size and body surface area. This is important to establish the potential need for a transannular patch. The pulmonary valve may appear thickened and may dome in these views.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2053974\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary arteries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The size and anatomy of the main pulmonary artery, the pulmonary arterial confluence, and the proximal branch pulmonary arteries can also be assessed in parasternal short axis views. The proximal branch pulmonary arteries should be assessed as far distally as possible in high parasternal views and in suprasternal notch long and short axis views, directing the transducer into the left and right chest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72460\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef72460 \">movie 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51331\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef51331 \">movie 6</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2053980\"><span class=\"h3\">Coronary arteries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The proximal coronary anatomy should be defined echocardiographically in patients with TOF. In addition to examining the coronary anatomy in the traditional short axis view, the examination should include sweeping the transducer anterior to the pulmonary outflow tract in parasternal long and short axis views (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63092\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef63092 \">movie 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-tetralogy-of-fallot/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. This permits the identification of variations in coronary anatomy, including the origin of the left anterior descending from the right coronary artery or dual vessel supply to the anterior descending distribution; in these situations, coronary branches crossing anteriorly complicate the surgical approach to relief of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2053986\"><span class=\"h3\">Aortic arch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aortic arch situs and the branching patterns of the brachiocephalic arteries are defined in the suprasternal notch long and short axis views. Complete evaluation of the arch in these views is also important in delineating the presence of additional potential sources of pulmonary blood flow, including aorticopulmonary collaterals and a patent ductus arteriosus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus in term infants, children, and adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2053992\"><span class=\"h3\">Atrial and ventricular septa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The echocardiographic evaluation of patients with TOF is completed by using both two dimensional imaging and color flow mapping of the atrial septum and ventricular septum in multiple imaging planes. This assessment defines additional atrial and ventricular septal defects and evaluates potential abnormalities of pulmonary and systemic venous return and the rare associated occurrence of left sided obstructive lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2053998\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemodynamic echocardiographic assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As previously discussed, the large and generally unrestrictive defect in this lesion permits equalization of right and left ventricular pressures. The direction and degree of shunting is determined by the balance of resistance to flow into the systemic and pulmonary circulations and, to a large degree, by the severity of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The modified Bernoulli equation, applied to the peak flow velocity measured in the right ventricular outflow tract, can be used to calculate the outflow tract gradient:</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;P</span> &#160;= &#160;4V<sup>2</sup></p><p>Where <span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;P</span> = peak pressure gradient between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery (mmHg), V = velocity obtained by continuous wave Doppler interrogation of the right ventricular outflow tract. The pulmonary artery pressure can be estimated by subtracting this pressure gradient from the systemic blood pressure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-doppler-echocardiography#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of Doppler echocardiography&quot;, section on 'Relationship between Doppler velocity and pressure gradient'</a>.)</p><p>While the modified Bernoulli equation is not valid in the setting of tunnel-like <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> multiple levels of obstruction, values obtained with this method correlate with those obtained in the cardiac catheterization laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-tetralogy-of-fallot/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In practice, the contributions of the infundibulum value and branch pulmonary arteries cannot be separated by Doppler interrogation.</p><p>In patients with minimal right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, the gradient across the right ventricular outflow tract will be low; the estimated pulmonary arterial pressure will be elevated; and shunting through the VSD, as assessed by pulsed Doppler and color flow mapping, will be predominantly left-to-right through much of the cardiac cycle. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical features of isolated ventricular septal defects in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with a large left-to-right shunt, left atrial and left ventricular dilation may be apparent by two dimensional imaging. In patients with more severe right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, the estimated pulmonary artery pressure is normal, and pulsed Doppler and color flow mapping demonstrate increasing right-to-left shunting at the ventricular septal defect during the cardiac cycle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2054004\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ECG in TOF typically shows right atrial enlargement and right ventricular hypertrophy. Right axis deviation, prominent R waves anteriorly and S waves posteriorly, an upright (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81339\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef81339 \">waveform 1</a>) T wave in V1 (after two days of life), and a qR pattern in the right sided chest leads may also be seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81339\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef81339 \">waveform 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-chamber-enlargement-and-hypertrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Chamber enlargement and hypertrophy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2054010\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest x-ray</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic chest x-ray of a patient with TOF demonstrates a &quot;boot shaped&quot; heart with an upturned apex and a concave main pulmonary artery segment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78997\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78997 \">image 5</a>). The heart size is often normal, and pulmonary flow will appear normal or decreased. A right aortic arch can be seen in 25 percent of patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2054016\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac catheterization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although echocardiography can reveal the anatomy in many patients with TOF, cardiac catheterization may still be necessary to further delineate the structure. It is particularly helpful for assessing levels of right ventricular outflow obstruction, branch pulmonary artery stenosis or hypoplasia, coronary artery anatomy, presence of aorticopulmonary collaterals, and presence of accessory ventricular septal defects.</p><p>The hemodynamic findings at catheterization typically reveal normal or only mildly elevated filling pressures. The left and right ventricular systolic pressures are equal and systemic due to the presence of the large VSD. Pulmonary artery pressures are normal or low. Saturations will indicate the degree of right-to-left shunting.</p><p>Angiographic assessment should be geared toward the information that is needed; biplane angiography is ideal. A right ventricular injection will often adequately demonstrate the multiple levels of right ventricular obstruction as well as the anatomy of the branch pulmonary arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57537\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57537 \">image 2</a>). This is typically done with the AP camera angled in a cranial and left anterior oblique projection, which allows better delineation of the branch pulmonary arteries. The lateral camera is kept in straight lateral projection, which provides excellent visualization of the infundibular and pulmonary valve anatomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79323\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79323 \">image 6</a>).</p><p>An aortic root injection will usually provide adequate identification of the coronary arteries, although selective injections may occasionally be needed. The coronary arteries usually are seen well with the AP camera in a right anterior oblique (RAO) projection and the lateral camera in a long axial oblique projection. The arch and descending aorta may also be seen in this view and provide evidence of the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus or collateral vessels. If collateral vessels are identified, selective injections are helpful to assess the areas of the pulmonary bed that they supply and whether they are the sole supply to these areas.</p><p>The ventricular septal defect is best seen from a left ventricular injection in a long axial oblique projection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52641\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52641 \">image 1</a>). With the AP camera in an RAO projection, one will often also see the infundibular obstruction from left to right flow across the VSD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63257\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63257 \">image 7</a>).</p><p>Cardiac catheterization can also play a therapeutic role in some patients with TOF. Balloon valvuloplasty of the pulmonary valve can improve pulmonary flow in many children; there may also be an increase in pulmonary valve annulus size that may decrease the need for transannular patch repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-tetralogy-of-fallot/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2053884\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, the prevalence of TOF is approximately 3.9 per 10,000 live births. TOF accounts for 7 to 10 percent of congenital heart disease. (See <a href=\"#H2053878\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although TOF typically occurs sporadically without other anomalies, it can be present as part of a known syndrome or genetic disorder, such as Down syndrome. Other associated cardiac anomalies occur in approximately 40 percent of patients with TOF. (See <a href=\"#H2053914\" class=\"local\">'Genetic factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2053908\" class=\"local\">'Associated cardiac features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathophysiologic effects of TOF are largely dependent upon the degree of RV outflow obstruction. The direction of blood flow across the VSD is determined by the path of least resistance for blood flow and not by the size of the VSD. If the resistance to the RV outflow is lower than systemic resistance, then there is a predominant left-to-right flow, and the patient is not cyanotic. However, with significant RV obstruction, there will be a right-to-left shunt across the VSD, resulting in cyanosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82493\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82493 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2053920\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation is dependent on the degree of RV outflow obstruction and determines whether there is a left-to-right (acyanotic) or right-to-left shunt. In general, the earlier the onset of systemic hypoxemia, the more likely it is that severe pulmonary outflow tract stenosis or atresia is present. In addition to persistent cyanosis in severely affected patients, other findings include intermittent hypercyanotic (tet) spells, crescendo-decrescendo harsh systolic ejection murmur, and a single second heart sound. (See <a href=\"#H2053926\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of TOF is typically made by echocardiography, which can usually delineate the location and number of VSDs, the anatomy and severity of RV outflow tract obstruction, the coronary artery and aortic arch anatomy, the presence of any associated anomalies, and the hemodynamic abnormalities associated with the anatomical defects.
