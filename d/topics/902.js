Many patients with esophageal disease have a high risk of pulmonary aspiration due to esophageal mass, stricture, or achalasia. Precautions for a full stomach are always employed since esophageal contents are unknown and retained ingested food may be present even after an appropriate fasting period. If general anesthesia is planned, these precautions include a rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) technique or awake endotracheal intubation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-in-adults#H459772238\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for gastrointestinal endoscopy in adults&quot;, section on 'Airway management'</a>.).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessing the airway.

If thoracoscopy or open thoracotomy is planned, plan placement of a device to achieve OLV.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or liver disease are common in patients with esophageal cancer, who often have a history of smoking <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> excessive alcohol consumption.

Additional invasive monitoring for patients undergoing major intrathoracic or intra-abdominal procedures typically includes an intra-arterial catheter to continuously monitor systemic blood pressure and a bladder catheter to intermittently monitor urine output. If there is an anticipated need for vasoactive drug infusions or for large-bore intravascular access to administer fluid or blood, a central venous catheter (CVC) may be inserted. Although central venous pressure (CVP) is a poor predictor of intravascular volume status and fluid responsiveness, it is typically monitored to provide supplemental data when a CVC is available.

Some clinicians administer oral sodium citrate 30 mL approximately 10 minutes prior to induction of general anesthesia to patients with symptomatic GERD, except for those with a significant esophageal obstruction (eg, tumor or stricture) or an esophageal motility disorder.

If thoracic epidural catheter placement is technically difficult due to anatomical considerations, a lumbar epidural technique is a reasonable alternative and may be as effective for postoperative analgesia, particularly if an opioid is added to the continuous epidural infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-esophageal-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>PVB techniques are an alternative to epidural analgesia, and are as effective in controlling acute pain in patients undergoing thoracotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-esophageal-surgery/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. A PVB catheter may be placed before surgery, or direct surgical placement into the open chest is an option in open thoracotomy cases.

It is particularly important to elevate the head of the bed to a 30-degree angle to minimize risk of regurgitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) for anesthesia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2031912521\"><span class=\"h4\">Considerations for one lung ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If open thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is planned, airway control typically involves placement of a device to achieve one lung ventilation (OLV). A double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT) may be inserted as part of the induction and endotracheal intubation sequence, or a single-lumen endotracheal tube (ETT) may be initially inserted with subsequent placement of a bronchial blocker. Final positioning of these devices is accomplished with fiberoptic bronchoscopic guidance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-isolation-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung isolation techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If an RSII technique is planned, the anesthesiologist should consider the predicted difficulty of endotracheal intubation, then select appropriate equipment and techniques for initial airway management and OLV. Selections are based on the patient's anatomy and esophageal pathology, as well as the anesthesiologist's expertise with available equipment.

Use of inhalation techniques compared with TIVA for general anesthesia has no clinically significant effect on oxygenation during OLV.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-maintenance-and-emergence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Maintenance and emergence&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The need for administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) is procedure-specific. For example, the surgeon may not need muscle relaxation during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) or repair or a Zenker's diverticulum. However, administration of an NMBA is often employed to improve surgical exposure and avoid any movement of the diaphragm during complex surgical procedures (eg, esophageal fundoplication, esophagectomy, repair of an esophagorespiratory fistula).

Timing of initiation of neuraxial infusion is based on the planned surgical procedure and hemodynamic stability of the patient. Typical thoracic epidural infusion solutions include an opioid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> with or without a local anesthetic agent (eg, 0.1% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a>), administered at approximately 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span>.

These processes result in development of atelectasis, shunting, and hypoxemia, which may lead to postoperative respiratory failure, pneumonia, or sepsis.

In several meta-analyses of pain management after thoracotomy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intra-abdominal incisions, TEA analgesia was generally superior to systemic opioid analgesia, with regard to pain scores, requirements for supplemental opioid analgesia, and pulmonary complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-esophageal-surgery/abstract/2,7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7-12</a>]. Benefits of TEA after esophagectomy include lower incidences of postoperative pneumonia and esophageal anastomotic leak, shorter length of stay in the intensive care unit, and better postoperative analgesia, compared with use of IV opioids alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-esophageal-surgery/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].

Meta-analyses suggest that continuous PVB analgesia provides comparable pain relief with fewer adverse side effects than TEA after thoracotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-esophageal-surgery/abstract/2,7,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,9,10</a>]. Even single-dose bilateral PVB provides superior analgesia, better maintenance of pulmonary function, and shorter length of hospital stay after esophagectomy, compared with IV opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-esophageal-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, many clinicians are not familiar with the PVB technique.

Alternative regional techniques include intercostal nerve blocks for thoracotomy, transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block for laparotomy, or intrathecal opioid analgesia. Addition of a supplemental IV opioid analgesic technique may be necessary, typically with a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-esophageal-surgery/abstract/7,16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16-19</a>].

Crystalloid is administered initially, while colloids are avoided or used only to replace an equivalent volume of blood loss. Red blood cells (RBCs) are transfused if necessary to treat hemoglobin &lt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. Similar to open pulmonary resection, fluid overload may cause damage to the endothelial glycocalyx and impair vascular homeostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-esophageal-surgery/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Administration of larger fluid volume (ie, &ge;4 L) is associated with increased incidence of pulmonary complications in the postoperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-esophageal-surgery/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].

We employ dynamic indices to detect hemodynamic responses to each fluid challenge (ie, volume responsiveness) when possible, thereby guiding goal-directed fluid therapy to maintain normovolemia. Dynamic hemodynamic parameters based on analysis of respirophasic variation in the continuous arterial pressure waveform during positive pressure ventilation are often used to provide goal-directed therapy for major surgical procedures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F86275\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86275 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F85850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85850 \">table 2</a>).

If hypotension persists despite maintenance of normovolemia, administration of a <span class=\"nowrap\">vasopressor/inotropic</span> agent is likely to restore systemic arterial blood pressure and blood flow to the esophageal anastomotic site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-esophageal-surgery/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. We prefer norepinephrine administered by infusion to provide vasopressor and inotropic, since this may produce less splanchnic vasoconstriction and better preservation of cardiac output than vasopressor agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F96387\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96387 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-esophageal-surgery/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>Some surgeons request avoidance of any vasopressor during esophagectomy due to concerns regarding potential vasoconstriction of blood vessels supplying the esophageal anastomosis, leading to tissue ischemia, necrosis, and anastomotic leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-esophageal-surgery/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, untreated intraoperative hypotension is also associated with postoperative anastomotic leaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-esophageal-surgery/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Furthermore, complete avoidance of vasopressors may lead to excessive fluid administration during attempts to treat hypotension.

In some patients, extubation is not possible and a period of postoperative controlled mechanical ventilation is necessary. If a double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT) is used to achieve OLV, it is usually changed to a single-lumen ETT before leaving the operating room at the end of the procedure. A tube exchanger is employed to maintain access to the airway during this exchange, as described separately.

Esophageal perforation may be caused by upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy procedures, most commonly when therapeutic interventions are performed <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in patients with esophageal diverticula. Another in-hospital cause is surgical trauma during an intrathoracic procedure (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-esophageal-perforation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of esophageal perforation&quot;</a>). Outside of hospital settings, vomiting against an esophageal constriction (ie, Boerhaave syndrome) may cause esophageal rupture.

An intra-arterial catheter and central venous catheter (CVC) are inserted if not already present, ideally before anesthetic induction. However, insertion should not unduly delay emergency surgical intervention. Insertion of two large-bore peripheral IV catheters (eg, 16 G or larger) is an alternative strategy that allows initial rapid administration of fluids, blood transfusions, and vasoactive agents.
