These autoantigens are referred to as &ldquo;Ro52&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ro60,&rdquo; respectively. The two autoantigens were originally thought to interact with each other, but subsequent studies have shown that the two proteins reside in distinct cellular compartments, with Ro60 localized to the nucleus and nucleolus and with Ro52 localized to the cytoplasm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11717213\"><span class=\"h2\">Ro60</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The amino acid sequence of the Ro60 autoantigen was described in the late 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]; Ro60 was shown to bind small, non-coding RNAs termed &ldquo;Y RNAs.&rdquo; Although the function of Y RNAs is unknown, one report suggests that Y RNAs may be a source of micro (mi)RNA molecules, which have a role in the regulation of messenger (m)RNA stability and translation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The crystal structure of Ro60 suggests that the protein can bind to both single- and double-stranded (ds)RNA. The protein may function as a &ldquo;RNA chaperone&rdquo; that binds to misfolded pre-5S ribosomal RNA and may hasten the degradation of the defective molecule. Ro60 may also bind to other cellular and viral RNAs in the cell, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) early RNA 1 (EBER1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Mice that lack the functional gene encoding Ro60 develop an autoimmune syndrome characterized by anti-ribosome and anti-chromatin antibodies, as well as glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], suggesting that Ro60 may have an important role in preventing systemic autoimmune disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11717220\"><span class=\"h2\">Ro52</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The amino acid sequence of the Ro52 autoantigen was reported in 1991 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Ro52 is an interferon-inducible protein that belongs to the &ldquo;tripartite motif&rdquo; family of proteins. Ro52 contains an amino (N)-terminal RING finger domain, followed by B-box and coiled-coil domains and by a carboxy (C)-terminal B30.2 or &ldquo;PRYPRY&rdquo; domain. The protein localizes to the cytoplasm and functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, an enzyme that adds ubiquitin molecules to target proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Ro52 interacts with a broad range of substrates and may either enhance or inhibit the function of target proteins. It interacts with the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules, via its C-terminal B30.2 domain, and catalyzes the poly-ubiquitinization of misfolded IgG, thereby hastening its degradation in proteasomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Ro52, like Ro60 and La (see <a href=\"#H11717236\" class=\"local\">'La/SSB antigen'</a> below), may also have a role in the regulation of mRNA stability. Ro52 interacts with and enhances the activity of decapping protein (DCP) 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], a protein that removes the 5&rsquo; cap from mRNA molecules. Removal of the 5&rsquo; cap exposes mRNA molecules to degradation by exoribonuclease I.</p><p>Ro52 may also have important roles in the regulation of inflammation. Ro52 adds an ubiquitin molecule to activated inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta (IKKB) and, thereby, down-regulates proinflammatory nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB) signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Ro52 also inhibits inflammation by targeting interferon regulatory factors (IRF) 3 and 7 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Consistent with the effects of Ro52 on NFKB signaling and IRF stability, mice that lack Ro52 develop an autoimmune disease, which is characterized by hypergammaglobulinemia and renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11717236\"><span class=\"h1\">La/SSB ANTIGEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autoantibodies directed against the <span class=\"nowrap\">La/SSB</span> autoantigen (La) interact with a 47-kD protein, which shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm but which is predominantly found in the nucleus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding La was identified in 1988 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The N-terminus of the protein contains a &ldquo;La&rdquo; RNA-binding domain and an adjacent RNA recognition motif (RRM), which cooperate to bind RNA. The C-terminus of the protein contains a second RRM followed by a short basic motif (&ldquo;SBF&rdquo; domain) and a nuclear localization sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The N-terminal portion of La mediates the interaction with the 3&rsquo; end of RNA polymerase III transcripts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. La participates in the processing of small, noncoding RNAs such as ribosomal 5S RNA.</p><p>La also binds cellular transfer (t)RNAs, as well as viral RNA molecules, including those produced by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Hepatitis A and C, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems/abstract/16,20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20-24</a>]. La may regulate the translation of viral RNAs by enhancing internal ribosomal entry site function. A report suggests that La has a critical role in regulating RNA interference (RNAi) by enhancing RNAi turnover in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. If confirmed, this result would suggest that La has a role in the regulation of messenger (m)RNA stability and translation. A mouse model that lacks the La protein has not been reported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349797881\"><span class=\"h1\">DETECTION OF ANTI-Ro AND ANTI-La ANTIBODIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H795098207\"><span class=\"h2\">Solid phase assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, antibodies directed against the Ro and La antigens were detected by immunodiffusion or by counter-immunoelectrophoresis. Most laboratories have adopted solid phase assays, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) or antigen-coated fluorescent microsphere and flow cytometry-based assays. Solid phase assays use either native or recombinant protein as substrate. These assays have advantages over other techniques including decreased cost, increased sensitivity for the detection of the corresponding autoantibodies, and the ability to quantify the amount of antibody. The increased sensitivity of solid phase assays comes at the cost of decreased specificity for the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. The reported prevalence of anti-Ro and anti-La autoantibodies in patients with autoimmune diseases depends to a great extent on the method used to detect the autoantibodies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29645360\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunofluorescence staining on HEp-2 substrates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients in whom the only autoantibodies present are anti-Ro antibodies may have a falsely negative antinuclear antibody (ANA) test using the traditional human epithelial cell line-2 (HEp-2) cell substrate; Ro60 immunoreactivity may be lost during the preparation of the cells and Ro52 is a cytoplasmic, rather than nuclear, autoantigen.</p><p>The ability to detect anti-Ro60 antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence has been enhanced by the use of a modified HEp-2 cell substrate (&ldquo;HEp-2000&rdquo;), in which transfection of a complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding Ro-60 was used to over-express the protein in 10 to 20 percent of the cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>Anti-Ro60 antibodies produce nucleolar and nuclear speckled staining patterns in transfected cells on the Hep-2000 substrate. Only 10 to 20 percent of the cells will produce this staining pattern if anti-Ro60 antibodies are the only autoantibodies present in a patient&rsquo;s serum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F86981\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86981 \">picture 1</a>). A limitation of the HEp-2000 substrate for detecting anti-Ro60 antibodies occurs when other autoantibodies are present in addition to anti-Ro60 antibodies. For example, antibodies directed against DNA will produce a homogeneous nuclear staining pattern in all cells and may obscure the characteristic anti-Ro60 pattern. As of 2012, only approximately 25 percent of clinical and commercial laboratories in the United States use the HEp-2000 substrate, while in Europe and Australia, Hep-2000 is used as the ANA substrate in approximately 75 percent of such laboratories. In laboratories using the traditional HEp-2 cell substrate, solid phase assay, instead of indirect immunofluorescence, is the more reliable approach to detecting anti-Ro60 antibodies.</p><p>In contrast to anti-Ro60, anti-Ro52 antibodies can be detected by indirect immunofluorescence using the traditional HEp-2 cell substrate. However, under normal tissue culture conditions, Ro52 localizes to the cell cytoplasm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F86982\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86982 \">picture 2</a>). Because Ro52 is not a nuclear autoantigen, autoantibodies directed against this antigen may not be reported by those commercial laboratories that only report the presence of antinuclear (but not anticytoplasmic) antibodies.</p><p>Although La has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, the protein is predominantly found in the nucleus of HEp-2 cells. Autoantibodies directed against La produce a speckled nuclear staining pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F86983\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86983 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11717265\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anti-Ro antibodies, detected by solid phase immunoassays, which have traditionally detected both Ro60 and Ro52, have been found in patients with a range of autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, 32 percent), Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome (59 percent), idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM, 19 percent), systemic sclerosis (21 percent), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD, 29 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA, 15 percent), as well as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC; previously referred to as primary biliary cirrhosis) and undefined connective tissue disease (UCTD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Women with anti-Ro antibodies (with or without anti-La and with or without autoimmune disease) are at increased risk for having a child with neonatal lupus syndrome. Anti-Ro antibodies may be the only autoantibodies present in more than half of the patients with &ldquo;antinuclear antibody (ANA)-negative&rdquo; SLE. Anti-Ro antibodies may also be the first detectable autoantibodies that precede the development of SLE and Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome in asymptomatic individuals.

One report suggests that the presence of anti-Sm antibodies, rather than anti-Ro antibodies, is associated with photosensitivity in patients with SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11717440\"><span class=\"h2\">Anti-Ro antibodies and other autoimmune diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anti-Ro antibodies may be present in conditions other than SLE and Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome, including PBC, IIM, and RA. Anti-Ro52 antibodies were detected in 28 to 32 percent of patients with PBC and the presence of these antibodies provide an important clue to the diagnosis of this treatable, but sometimes asymptomatic, autoimmune liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>].
