Most women with high blood pressure will have a normal pregnancy. But women with high blood pressure have a higher chance of having certain problems during pregnancy, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preeclampsia &ndash; Women with preeclampsia have high blood pressure and too much protein in their urine or problems with certain organs. Preeclampsia usually happens during the second half of pregnancy, and can be a dangerous condition. It can cause problems with a baby's growth in the mother's uterus. It can also affect the mother's liver, kidneys, blood, heart, eyes, and nervous system. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Placental abruption &ndash; The placenta is the organ inside the uterus that brings the baby nutrients and oxygen, and carries away waste. It is attached to the inside wall of the uterus. A placental abruption is when part or all of the placenta separates from the uterus before the baby is born. If this happens, the baby might not get enough nutrients and oxygen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slowed growth of the baby &ndash; The baby can be small and not grow normally.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7861124\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do before trying to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before you try to get pregnant, talk with your doctor. He or she will work with you to get your blood pressure under control. If you are taking blood pressure medicines, this might involve changing your dose or switching to a different medicine. Your doctor will also make sure that your blood pressure medicine is safe to take during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7861139\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I have tests during pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. At each visit, the doctor or nurse will check your blood pressure and your baby's growth. You will also have tests to check your baby's health at different times during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7861154\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need to take blood pressure medicine during pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. This depends on how high your blood pressure is. If it is very high, you will need to take medicine during pregnancy to keep it under control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7861169\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor or nurse right away if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You don't feel your baby move as much as usual.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You start having contractions. A contraction is when the uterus muscle squeezes. This can cause pain and make your belly hard.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have belly pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have bleeding from the vagina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have any symptoms of preeclampsia. These can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A bad headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Changes in vision, such as blurry vision or flashes of lights</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pain in the upper belly</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7861184\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I have a normal vaginal delivery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Most women can have a normal vaginal delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7861198\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my baby be healthy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably. If you have high blood pressure during pregnancy, you are more likely to give birth earlier than normal. That's because if you have preeclampsia, a placental abruption, or a baby that is small for its age, the doctor might need to deliver your baby early. But if your blood pressure is under control during pregnancy, chances are good that your baby will be healthy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7861213\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-high-blood-pressure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for high blood pressure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preeclampsia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-plan-and-prepare-for-a-healthy-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to plan and prepare for a healthy pregnancy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Preeclampsia (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
