The following is a brief discussion of the role of each of these modalities in assessing knee tumors and tumor-like disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8715823\"><span class=\"h2\">Plain film radiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain film is the initial modality of choice for detection and assessment of the general features of the tumor. Accuracy of plain film for detection of soft tissue tumors is limited. Plain film is the most valuable method to evaluate the margin between normal bone and a neoplasm that is characteristic of bone tumor (zone of transition). Radiographic features of the zone of transition are important in distinguishing between benign and malignant bone lesions. Plain film radiography also demonstrates the extent of cortical destruction, periosteal reaction, matrix calcifications, and pathological fractures. Certain radiographic patterns, combined with the age of the patient, can be very suggestive of specific tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8715830\"><span class=\"h2\">CT scanning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT is the best method for detection of juxtaarticular bone lesions not optimally seen by plain film. CT provides better assessment of cortical invasion, pathological fracture, periosteal reaction, and matrix mineralization and detection of cystic or fatty nature of tumor. CT is used for biopsy guidance, preoperative evaluation, and detection of recurrence. For primary bone tumors, intravenous contrast is not usually indicated. For soft tissue masses, use of CT with intravenous contrast is recommended when MRI is not available or is contraindicated; in these cases, contrast administration helps to delineate the mass, distinguishing it from adjacent soft tissue, and shows cystic and necrotic areas, vascularity, and the relationship to vascular structures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8715837\"><span class=\"h2\">MR imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI is nonspecific for differentiation of most tumors. MRI is the modality of choice for local staging, for definition of medullary and extracortical spread, and for delineation of tumor in relation to critical neurovascular structures.</p><p>The zone of transition, an important feature in plain film imaging, as discussed earlier (see <a href=\"#H8715823\" class=\"local\">'Plain film radiography'</a> above), is not valid on MRI. Gadolinium contrast administration may be useful to differentiate solid from cystic or necrotic tumor, to evaluate response to nonsurgical therapy, and to detect tumor recurrence.</p><p>Administration of gadolinium-containing MRI contrast agents should be avoided in patients with severely impaired renal function (eg, estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span>. If gadolinium-based imaging must be performed in a patient with moderately to severely impaired renal function, there may be a role for dialysis to reduce the risk of development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NFS). Approaches to prevention of NFS are discussed separately.

Other tumor-like lesions that occur within the knee joint are Hoffa&rsquo;s disease and cystic masses such as meniscal cyst and intraarticular ganglion cyst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-knee-tumors-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Primary malignant intraarticular knee lesions include synovial sarcoma and synovial chondrosarcoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8715858\"><span class=\"h2\">Tenosynovial giant cell tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TGCT is an idiopathic, benign disorder occurring primarily in young and middle-aged adults. The pathologic process can involve any joint, bursa, or tendon sheath. The disease is characterized by synovial hypertrophy with diffuse hemosiderin deposits within the joint. The knee is the most commonly involved joint in TGCT. TGCT typically involves one compartment of the knee, and the joint space is maintained until late in the disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain film radiography &ndash; Plain film radiography often demonstrates a joint effusion, suprapatellar soft tissue density, and erosions in the femur and tibia, without signs of bone repair or osteophyte formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-knee-tumors-in-adults/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) &ndash; MRI confirms the diagnosis of TGCT. MRI findings of TGCT are joint effusion and nodular intraarticular masses with low signal intensity in most (T1, T2, short tau inversion recovery [STIR]) sequences from hemosiderin deposition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F54059\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54059 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-knee-tumors-in-adults/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Bony erosions (when present) and extraarticular extension of the lesion are well-demonstrated on MRI. MRI is useful in the preoperative planning and the postoperative follow-up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography (CT) &ndash; CT demonstrates hyperdense, hemosiderin-laden masses and delineates bone cysts and erosions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-knee-tumors-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. CT is also valuable for needle biopsy guidance when MRI is nondiagnostic or contraindicated, and for preoperative planning.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8715865\"><span class=\"h2\">Synovial (osteo)chondromatosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Synovial chondromatosis is a benign disorder of the synovial lining, characterized by the presence of loose cartilaginous bodies. Ossification of these cartilaginous bodies may occur in 70 to 95 percent of cases (osteochondromatosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-knee-tumors-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This monoarticular disorder is more common in men. The knee is the most commonly involved joint. Secondary osteoarthritis is present due to cartilage damage from the presence of loose bodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-knee-tumors-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain film radiography &ndash; Plain film radiography demonstrates joint effusion and is diagnostic when the chondroid loose bodies are ossified enough to be visualized by radiograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55713\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55713 \">image 2</a>). Erosions are not a common feature in the knee because of the expansile nature of this joint as compared with the hip joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-knee-tumors-in-adults/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT and MRI &ndash; CT or MRI is recommended when synovial chondromatosis is clinically suspected and when radiographs are normal or only demonstrate joint effusion. CT is the optimal imaging modality to detect and characterize calcification, which is present in majority of cases. MRI and CT show the loose bodies when they are not visible on plain film. MRI and CT also show the extent of the lesions, required for preoperative assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-knee-tumors-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8715872\"><span class=\"h2\">Synovial hemangioma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Synovial hemangioma is a rare benign vascular lesion that most commonly affects the knee joint. It occurs mostly in children and adolescents and presents with swelling, pain, and nontraumatic hemarthrosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemarthrosis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemarthrosis&quot;, section on 'Tumors'</a>.)</p><p>Plain film radiography is normal in half of the patients or shows joint effusion, soft tissue swelling, and erosions. The presence of phleboliths is suggestive of hemangioma, but MRI is the modality of choice for diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-knee-tumors-in-adults/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8715879\"><span class=\"h2\">Lipoma arborescens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lipoma arborescens is an intraarticular disorder characterized by benign lipomatous proliferation of the synovium, manifested as slowly progressive and painless joint effusion. Etiology is unknown; however, it can be associated with osteoarthritis and chronic inflammation of the synovium such as rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-knee-tumors-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It occurs more commonly in men, in the fourth and fifth decade, and, most often, in the knee joint. MRI demonstrates characteristic villous synovial masses that have fat signal intensity on all imaging sequences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F64392\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64392 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-knee-tumors-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2378418900\"><span class=\"h2\">Hoffa&rsquo;s disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hoffa&rsquo;s disease affects mainly young women and presents with anterior knee pain during climbing and descending the stairs. Activities predisposing to development of Hoffa&rsquo;s disease are jump sports such as basketball, volleyball, and high jumping. Hyperextension of the knee during these activities result in impingement of the fat pad, leading to inflammation, bleeding, necrosis, fibrosis, and possible ossification. Plain radiography shows joint effusion and anterior soft tissue swelling. MRI shows edema and fibrosis of the infrapatellar fat pad, which may contain hemosiderin deposits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-knee-tumors-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2566595819\"><span class=\"h2\">Meniscal cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the knee, cysts can occur in the meniscus in association with meniscal degeneration and tears. They usually develop in the medial meniscus and may reach up to 2 cm. They are filled with mucoid fluid and present as well-defined cystic masses on MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-knee-tumors-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2458060595\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraarticular ganglion cyst</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A ganglion cyst is a benign cystic mass without a synovial lining, surrounded by connective tissue and filled with gelatinous fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-knee-tumors-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Ganglion cysts can be intraarticular, extraarticular, intraosseous, and periosteal. Intraarticular ganglion cysts are uncommon lesions that typically arise from the cruciate ligaments, most commonly the anterior cruciate ligament, or within Hoffa&rsquo;s fat pad. They present as multilocular cysts on MRI. Intravenous contrast may be required to differentiate between a ganglion cyst and hemangioma or synovial sarcoma in Hoffa&rsquo;s fat pad [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-knee-tumors-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].
