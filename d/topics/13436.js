Temperature monitoring is not typically necessary during mild or moderate sedation, or if a peripheral nerve block is used without general anesthesia because thermoregulatory control is well maintained in these circumstances.

Management of cooling and hypothermia during CPB and subsequent rewarming to reestablish normothermia are discussed separately.

Undesirable alternative sites include uncompensated skin temperature since it is generally lower than core temperature (although forehead temperature is less variable than other cutaneous sites) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Temperatures in the external aural canal and rectum also equilibrate poorly with core temperature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H856773501\"><span class=\"h1\">ANESTHETIC EFFECTS ON THERMOREGULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both general and neuraxial anesthesia profoundly impair thermoregulatory control, with the consequence that unwarmed surgical patients become hypothermic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2154643773\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal thermoregulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normally, body temperature is tightly regulated in the core compartment (primarily in the trunk and head), which constitutes approximately one-half the body mass and dominates central thermoregulatory responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Peripheral tissues (primarily the arms and legs) act as a thermal buffer and vary over a fairly wide range. For example, peripheral tissues are normally 2 to 4&deg;C cooler than the core in patients exposed to hospital ambient temperatures.</p><p>The primary thermoregulatory defenses in humans are arteriovenous shunt vasoconstriction and shivering in response to cold, and active precapillary vasodilation and sweating in response to heat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. The thresholds for vasoconstriction (or vasodilation) and sweating are similar, while the shivering occurs at a 1&deg;C lower temperature threshold (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F116093\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116093 \">figure 1</a>). However, intraoperative models of the human thermoregulatory system are not as simple as an <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;on/off&quot;</span> thermostat because of sequential activation of defenses as well as the effects of anesthesia on thermoregulatory control, as noted below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H749007265\" class=\"local\">'Effects of general anesthesia'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1990046923\" class=\"local\">'Effects of neuraxial anesthesia'</a> below.)</p><p>In older adults, cold-defense thresholds are reduced approximately 1&deg;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In infants, but not in adults, non-shivering thermogenesis is an additional thermoregulatory defense [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H749007265\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects of general anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhalation anesthetics, including volatile agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/16,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18,19</a>], as well as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]), and intravenous (IV) anesthetics including sedative-hypnotic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexmedetomidine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]) and opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] impair thermoregulatory control in a dose-dependent fashion. Some sedative agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> do not appreciably impair thermoregulatory control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The precise mechanisms by which anesthetic agents impair thermoregulatory control are unknown. Typical combinations and doses of agents used to maintain general anesthesia synchronously reduce the thresholds for vasoconstriction and shivering in a concentration-dependent manner that is linear for IV anesthetic agents, but disproportionately greater at higher concentrations of volatile anesthetics. Most general anesthetic agents also obscure the normal pattern of shivering and reduce maximum shivering intensity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], although gain and maximum intensity of shivering are maintained with opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Notably, shivering is not possible when patients are paralyzed by neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs).</p><p>Overall, general anesthetics decrease the vasoconstriction threshold to approximately 34.5&deg;C, and decrease the shivering threshold to 1&deg;C lower than the vasoconstriction threshold. Sweating usually remains nearly intact during general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The result is that the normally regulated range of core temperatures that spans only a few tenths of a degree Celsius increases 10- to 20-fold during general anesthesia. Only when core temperature decreases to below the vasoconstriction threshold (or exceeds the sweating threshold) will anesthetized patients activate thermoregulatory defenses.</p><p>In addition to decreasing the vasoconstriction threshold, volatile anesthetic agents reduce gain of the response (ie, the extent to which vasoconstriction increases with further reduction in core temperature) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Once thermoregulatory vasoconstriction is triggered, it effectively constrains metabolic heat to the core thermal compartment even during general anesthesia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1990046923\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects of neuraxial anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the local anesthetics used in neuraxial anesthetic techniques (eg, epidural or spinal anesthesia) do not reach the brain, patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia become hypothermic to a degree that is similar to those having general anesthesia. Impairment of thermoregulatory control by neuraxial anesthesia occurs via three mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypothermia provokes less thermal discomfort than would be expected in the presence of a neuraxial block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Consequently, patients typically do not complain of feeling cold during epidural or spinal anesthesia even if they are hypothermic. The mechanisms for reduced thermal discomfort are unknown, but are probably due to tonic cold signals from the lower body being blocked. This absence of tonic cold signals from the lower body is interpreted by the hypothalamus as indicating a relatively warm state.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuraxial anesthesia impairs central thermoregulatory control, reducing the vasoconstriction and shivering thresholds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Changes in the shivering threshold are proportional to the block height. The precise mechanisms by which administration of local anesthesia in a location distant from the brain can impair central thermoregulatory control are unknown, but are likely peripherally mediated, and probably due to tonic cold signals from the lower body being blocked, similar to impairment of thermal discomfort by neuraxial anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Central impairment is evident even when epidural anesthesia is induced with a short-acting local anesthetic with a plasma half-life of only seconds such as 2-chloroprocaine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, impairment of central thermoregulatory control is less after neuraxial anesthesia compared with general anesthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since active vasodilation, sweating, vasoconstriction, and shivering are autonomic thermoregulatory defenses that are primarily neurally mediated, each requires intact nerve conduction. Neuraxial anesthesia prevents most efferent and afferent neural activity to and from the lower body to the brain including afferent pain signals and the efferent signals controlling vasoconstriction and shivering. With impaired neurally mediated signaling, the gain and maximum intensity of thermoregulatory defenses are substantially reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p>In contrast with neuraxial anesthesia, peripheral nerve blocks do not have clinically important thermoregulatory effects. Peripheral blocks only prevent local neurally-mediated thermoregulatory responses, which can be compensated for in other regions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4203642135\"><span class=\"h2\">Combined general and neuraxial techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients having combined general and neuraxial anesthetic techniques are at highest risk for intraoperative hypothermia due to the additive effects of each technique in impairment of thermoregulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. With combined techniques, the vasoconstriction threshold temperature, rate at which vasoconstriction occurs, and maximum intensity of vasoconstriction are all reduced by the sum of the independent effects of each individual technique. Thus, patients become colder before thermoregulatory defenses are activated and once activated, defenses are less effective in preventing further decreases in core hypothermia compared with patients having either technique alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87204780\"><span class=\"h1\">INTRAOPERATIVE HYPOTHERMIA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3520955002\"><span class=\"h2\">Causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraoperative hypothermia (ie, decrease in core temperature) develops in nearly all unwarmed surgical patients and results from the combination of anesthesia-induced thermoregulatory impairment, cool operating room ambient temperature, and exposure of open body cavities during certain surgical procedures. The most important of these factors is thermoregulatory impairment since unanesthetized adults would otherwise resist surgical heat loss via vasoconstriction and shivering. Intraoperative hypothermia develops with a characteristic three-phase pattern:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the initial hour after induction of general anesthesia or activation of a neuraxial block, core temperature decreases rapidly, due to redistribution from the from core to peripheral tissues (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F116186\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116186 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. This initial rapid reduction in core temperature is primarily due to anesthetic-induced vasodilation resulting from impairment of central thermoregulatory control rather than direct peripheral effects of anesthetics (see <a href=\"#H749007265\" class=\"local\">'Effects of general anesthesia'</a> above). Although this redistribution of heat does not alter mean-body temperature, it does substantially reduce core temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redistribution hypothermia is typically followed by a slower, linear reduction in core temperature that results from heat loss exceeding metabolic heat production. The main routes of heat loss to the environment are usually radiation and convection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F116184\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116184 \">figure 3</a>). Normally, only small amounts of heat are lost via conduction and evaporation. Unknown amounts of heat are lost through surgical incisions, but the amount may be substantial when incisions are large, and especially during open abdominal surgery. The rate at which temperature decreases is a function of the difference between metabolic heat production and heat loss, which in turn depends on ambient temperature, extent of surgical exposure of skin or body cavities, and whether the patient is insulated or actively warmed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once patients become sufficiently hypothermic to activate thermoregulatory vasoconstriction (typically at approximately 34.5&deg;C during general anesthesia), core temperature reaches a plateau and does not decrease further regardless of the incision size or duration of surgery. A plateau in core temperature may also result from a passive process if heat production is balanced against heat loss. Once activated, arteriovenous shunt vasoconstriction effectively retains metabolic heat in the core tissues, thus preventing further decreases in core hypothermia. However, heat loss from peripheral tissues continues. Consequently, body heat content continues to decrease even though core temperature remains constant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1771202618\"><span class=\"h2\">Consequences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cellular functions are temperature-dependent, and hypothermia also provokes systemic responses. Thus, even mild hypothermia (eg, &ge;1 to 2&deg;C reductions in core temperature) may have adverse consequences.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2985110782\"><span class=\"h3\">Coagulopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypothermia causes coagulopathy, primarily due to reversible impairment of platelet aggregation via reduced release of thromboxane A3, which impairs formation of an initial platelet plug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Hypothermia also reduces the activity of enzymes in the coagulation cascade, which in turn reduces clot formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The combination of platelet and enzyme impairment typically increases perioperative blood loss and the need for transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In one meta-analysis, even mild (eg, 1&deg;C) hypothermia increased blood loss by approximately 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Hypothermia-induced coagulopathy is often missed with routine laboratory testing because these tests are performed at 37&deg;C, and are thus reported as normal although they would not be if temperature-adjusted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1492907477\"><span class=\"h3\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are at least three mechanisms by which perioperative hypothermia impairs host defenses against surgical wound contamination:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced tissue perfusion to wounded tissue with reduced access for key immune cells (due to the vasoconstriction that occurs to constrain metabolic heat to the core).

Either systemic warming or local wound warming may comparably reduce infection risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2491275811\"><span class=\"h3\">Prolongation of drug effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even mild hypothermia prolongs the action of drugs used during anesthesia, particularly neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. For example, hypothermia doubles the duration of action of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vecuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vecuronium</a> (2&deg;C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>], and prolongs the duration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atracurium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atracurium</a> by 60 percent (3&deg;C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Similarly, plasma <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> concentrations are increased by 28 percent with hypothermia (3&deg;C), primarily due to reduced hepatic blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Consequences of delayed drug disposition include delayed reversal or neuromuscular blockade and delayed emergence in hypothermic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-problems-in-the-post-anesthesia-care-unit-pacu#H2764252826\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory problems in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU)&quot;, section on 'Pharyngeal muscular weakness'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-emergence-and-emergence-delirium-in-adults#H1984581323\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed emergence and emergence delirium in adults&quot;, section on 'Consider specific drug effects'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90525450\"><span class=\"h3\">Shivering</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vasoconstriction is effective even during anesthesia. Consequently, core temperature rarely decrease to the 1&deg;C lower temperature that would be necessary to reach the shivering threshold. Shivering should be avoided since it acutely augments metabolic rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>] and potentially provokes myocardial ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/14,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,53</a>]. Postoperative shivering is common in hypothermic patients.

These effects increase myocardial oxygen consumption, particularly if shivering occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/14,53,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,53,57</a>]. In patients with ischemic heart disease, these effects may lead to myocardial ischemia and arrhythmias although there is scant evidence that mild hypothermia causes myocardial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3528814401\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention and management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypothermia develops in nearly all unwarmed surgical patients. Even patients who are actively warmed initially develop transient core hypothermia due to redistribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Typically, core temperature decreases during the initial hour of anesthesia, but further decreases depend on ambient temperature, size of the operation, patient morphometric characteristics, and efficacy of insulation or active warming.</p><p>Various perioperative warming strategies are available. These can broadly be categorized as prewarming strategies (before induction of anesthesia), passive insulation, or devices that actively warm the skin surface, heat fluids, warm inspired gases, or are endovascular systems that directly exchange heat with the circulating blood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2144232794\"><span class=\"h3\">Prewarming before induction of anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Redistribution hypothermia can be ameliorated by prewarming patients. Although warming patients before induction of anesthesia or placement of a neuraxial block does not substantially increase core temperature (which remains tightly regulated), the absorbed heat increases peripheral tissue temperature, thereby reducing the normal core-to-peripheral tissue temperature gradient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/12,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,58</a>]. Typically, core temperature in prewarmed patients remains approximately 0.4&deg;C warmer than those who are not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3481555206\"><span class=\"h3\">Passive insulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A single layer of passive insulation reduces cutaneous heat loss 30 percent at typical operating room temperatures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The type of insulation is relatively unimportant since the layer of still air trapped below the insulator is actually the major heat-loss barrier. Fully covered skin approximately compensates for the 30 percent reduction in metabolic heat production that accompanies general anesthesia (see <a href=\"#H749007265\" class=\"local\">'Effects of general anesthesia'</a> above). Adding additional layers of insulation provides little additional benefit. For example, three layers of passive insulation only reduces heat loss by approximately 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

These systems are effective because modest heat intensity is distributed over a large body surface area. Since the air does not reach dependent regions of the skin, the dangerous combination of heat and pressure on skin is avoided. In the supine position, forced-air warming is more effective on the lower body because a larger body surface area is covered compared with upper body warming [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].

However, laminar flow itself paradoxically increases infection risk, apparently by detaching bacterial particles from bedside personnel and driving them directly into the incision. There is no clinical evidence that forced-air warming increases infection risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>], and both major trials showing that normothermia reduces infection risk were conducted with forced-air warming [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Furthermore, there is no effect of forced-air warming on the number of bacterial colonies that grow when bacterial culture plates are placed near patients who are having surgery with laminar flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H501856449\"><span class=\"h4\">Fluid warming</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluid warming does not significantly warm patients because intravenous (IV) fluids can only slightly exceed core temperature. Thus, fluid warming does not compensate for initial hypothermia due to redistribution from peripheral to core tissues, nor for subsequent losses from skin surface and surgical incisions. Similarly, warming of irrigation fluids used in the peritoneal cavity does not transfer meaningful amounts of heat to the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-temperature-management/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>Fluids of any type should be warmed prior to administration in large volumes (eg, more than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/hour)</span>. Patients can be cooled considerably by infusion of unwarmed IV fluid or exposure to unwarmed peritoneal irrigation fluid. For example, each liter of fluid infused at ambient temperature reduces mean body temperature by 0.25&deg;C in a 70 kg patient. A unit of refrigerated blood also reduces mean body temperature by 0.25&deg;C since the unit is approximately one-half a liter but is twice as cold as room temperature crystalloid.
