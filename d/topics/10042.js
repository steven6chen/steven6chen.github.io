These methods are the best choice for many women and teens who want birth control. That's because they work so well to prevent pregnancy. People who use them also like not having to think about their birth control every day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102130766\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the different types of long-acting methods of birth control?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-acting birth control methods include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrauterine devices (IUDs) &ndash; These are small, T-shaped devices made of flexible plastic. If you get an IUD, a doctor or nurse will put it into your uterus through the vagina and cervix. Some IUD brand names include Paragard, Mirena, Liletta, and Skyla.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Paragard contains copper. It can stay in place and keeps working for up to 10 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mirena, Liletta, and Skyla all release the hormone progestin. They can stay in place and keep working for 3 to 5 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birth control implant &ndash; This is a flexible plastic rod that is 1.5 inches long (about the size of a match). A nurse or doctor injects the implant under the skin on the inside of your upper arm. It contains progestin, which is slowly released into the body. The implant, called Nexplanon, lasts for 3 years.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102130781\"><span class=\"h1\">How well do long-acting methods of birth control work?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Of all birth control options, long-acting methods work the best to prevent pregnancy. Fewer than 1 in 100 women who have an IUD or birth control implant get pregnant during the first year of use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102130798\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the benefits and downsides of long-acting methods of birth control?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main benefit of long-acting birth control is that you do not have to remember to do anything or take any medicines on a regular basis.</p><p>The main downside of these methods is that unlike condoms, they do not protect against infections you can catch during sex (called &quot;sexually transmitted infections&quot; or &quot;sexually transmitted diseases&quot;).</p><p>Because of the cost of putting in an IUD or implant, these choices are best for women who do not want to become pregnant for at least 1 year. A doctor or nurse needs to remove the IUD or implant when you don't want to use it anymore.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102130815\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I change my mind and want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have an IUD or birth control implant, you can have the device removed. You will likely be able to get pregnant right away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102130832\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-birth-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Choosing birth control (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-contraception-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Emergency contraception (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sterilization-for-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sterilization for women (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-birth-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hormonal birth control (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-devices-iud-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Intrauterine devices (IUD) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-acting-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Long-acting methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=birth-control-which-method-is-right-for-me-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Birth control; which method is right for me?
