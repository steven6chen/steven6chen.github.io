In 2012 and 2013, CVD was estimated to result in 17.3 million deaths worldwide on an annual basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. As a diagnostic category, CVD includes four major areas:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary heart disease (CHD), manifested by myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris, heart failure, and coronary death</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebrovascular disease, manifested by stroke and transient ischemic attack</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral artery disease, manifested by intermittent claudication</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic atherosclerosis and thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysm</p><p/><p>An overview of the established risk factors for CVD is presented here. An overview of the possible emerging CVD risk factors, data supporting the importance of the individual risk factors (eg, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking), coronary risk factors of particular importance in women and in young patients, and estimation of coronary risk in an individual patient are discussed elsewhere.

Coronary heart disease (CHD) accounts for approximately one-third to one-half of the total cases of CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The lifetime risk of CHD was illustrated in a study of 7733 participants, age 40 to 94, in the Framingham Heart Study who were initially free of CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The lifetime risk for individuals at age 40 was 49 percent in men and 32 percent in women. Even those who were free from CHD at age 70 had a non-trivial lifetime risk of developing CHD (35 and 24 percent in men and women, respectively). Similar findings have been reported in a meta-analysis of 18 cohorts involving over 250,000 men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

In one cohort of over 1.9 million persons age 30 years or older free of known baseline CVD who were followed for a median of six years, the majority of initial CVD presentations were neither myocardial infarction (MI) nor stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These presentations, which included angina, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, transient ischemic attack, and abdominal aortic aneurysm, along with some less common manifestations, represented 66 percent of the initial CVD presentations.</p><p>While CVD remains the leading cause of death in most developed countries, mortality from acute MI appears to have decreased by as much as 50 percent in the 1990s and 2000s. Among 49 countries in Europe and northern Asia, over four million persons die annually from CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the United States, approximately 1.5 million persons suffer a heart attack or stroke annually, resulting in over 250,000 deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

Between 1990 and 2010, it is estimated that the global burden of CHD increased by 29 percent due to increases in therapy and longevity along with global population growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Additionally, 2010 data showed significant regional variation in CHD mortality, with the largest number of CHD deaths seen in South Asia but the highest rates of CHD mortality seen in Eastern Europe and Central Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In a study of 156,424 persons from 17 countries (3 high-income, 10 middle-income, 4 low-income), the INTERHEART risk score (for assessing risk factors) was highest in high-income countries and lowest in low-income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, CVD events and mortality appeared inversely related to the INTERHEART score, with significantly lower rates of CVD events and mortality in high-income countries compared with middle- and low-income countries, a finding which is purportedly due to greater risk factor modification in high-income countries.</p><p>Many risk factors for CVD are modifiable by specific preventive measures. In the worldwide INTERHEART study of patients from 52 countries, nine potentially modifiable factors accounted for over 90 percent of the population-attributable risk of a first MI: smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, daily consumption of fruits and vegetables, regular alcohol consumption, and regular physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4874544\"><span class=\"h1\">NONCORONARY ATHEROSCLEROTIC DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients without known coronary heart disease (CHD) have a risk of subsequent cardiovascular events that is equivalent to that of patients with established CHD. Noncoronary atherosclerotic arterial disease includes patients with carotid artery disease, peripheral artery disease, or abdominal aortic aneurysm. Patients with any form of noncoronary atherosclerotic arterial disease have a 10-year risk of developing CHD that exceeds 20 percent. Concurrent risk factors should be treated aggressively in such patients.

The five leading modifiable risk factors (hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and smoking) are estimated to be responsible for more than half of cardiovascular mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. On the other hand, the absence of major risk factors predicts a much lower risk of CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

This insidious process begins with fatty streaks that are first seen in adolescence; these lesions progress into plaques in early adulthood, and culminate in thrombotic occlusions and coronary events in middle age and later life.

Risk factor assessment is useful in adults to guide therapy for dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes, and multivariate formulations can be used to help estimate risk for coronary disease events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

The relative difference in CHD risk between the sexes was largest among the youngest subjects (25 to 49 years), but the absolute difference was largest in the older age group due to a higher prevalence (60 to 64 years). Almost half of the difference in CHD risk between men and women was associated with the sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors, particularly the high-density lipoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">(HDL)/total</span> cholesterol ratio and smoking. Differences in serum total cholesterol, blood pressure, body mass index, and prevalence of diabetes accounted for approximately one-third of the age-related increase in CHD prevalence in men and 50 to 60 percent in women.</p><p>Based upon the absolute, relative, and attributable risks imposed by the various risk factors, concepts of &quot;normal&quot; have evolved from usual or average to more optimal values associated with long-term freedom from disease. As a result, optimal blood pressure, blood glucose, and lipid values have been revised downward in the past 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>].</p><p>Some authors have asserted that approximately one-half of all patients suffering a manifestation of CHD have no established risk factors other than age and gender, a claim that has contributed to efforts to identify other markers of cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].

Patients in the highest quintile of weight fluctuation (mean variability of 3.9 kg) had significantly higher risks of any CHD event (64 percent higher), any CVD event (85 percent higher), and total mortality (124 percent higher).
