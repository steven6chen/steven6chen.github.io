However, cervical cancer is a treatable condition, and there is an excellent chance of cure if the cancer is found and treated in the early stages.</p><p>This article discusses the diagnosis and treatment of women with early-stage cervical cancer. A separate article discusses issues specific to the treatment of early-stage cervical cancer in women who may want to become pregnant in the future. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-preservation-in-women-with-early-stage-cervical-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Fertility preservation in women with early-stage cervical cancer (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More detailed information about cervical cancer, written for health care providers, is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Professional level information'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4327830\"><span class=\"h1\">THE CERVIX</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cervix is the bottom part of the uterus (womb). The cervix opens into the vagina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The cervix is composed of two main types of cells. The outer layer of the cervix is covered with cells called squamous cells. &quot;Squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix&quot; is the name for a cancer that affects these cells.</p><p>The cervix also includes glandular (also called columnar) cells, which line the canal of the cervix that leads into the uterus (the endocervical canal). These cells can also become cancerous; when they do, they are called &quot;adenocarcinoma of the cervix.&quot;</p><p>Although they arise from different types of cells, squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the cervix are treated similarly in the early stages. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4327880\"><span class=\"h1\">CERVICAL CANCER RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cervical cancers are caused by infection with a virus called human papillomavirus (HPV).</p><p>HPV is spread by direct skin-to-skin contact, including sexual intercourse, oral sex, anal sex, or any other contact involving the genital area (eg, hand-to-genital or mouth-to-genital contact). HPV infection can also cause a noncancerous condition called condyloma (genital warts). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-warts-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Genital warts in women (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>HPV infection is very common. Approximately 75 to 80 percent of sexually active adults will acquire a genital HPV infection before the age of 50. There are many types of HPV, and these affect different areas of the body. Most HPV infections are temporary because the body's immune system effectively clears the infection.</p><p>Of the HPV types that infect the cervix and surrounding areas (vagina, vulva, anus), most do not cause cancer. Some HPV types cause genital warts. The HPV types that are high risk for causing cancer will do so if the infection persists. Approximately 10 to 20 percent of women with a cervical HPV infection will still have the infection after two years. More information about HPV testing is available in a separate article. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cervical cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Additional risk factors for cervical cancer include cigarette smoking and a weakened immune system (caused by certain diseases, medications, or <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS)</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CERVICAL CANCER SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typically, cervical cancer develops slowly over several years. In some women, the cancer does not cause any symptoms, while in others it causes abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge. This can include bleeding between menstrual periods, bleeding after sex, or bleeding after menopause. This bleeding may be spotting or heavy bleeding.</p><p>Abnormal vaginal bleeding can be caused by many other conditions, not related to cancer. If you have abnormal vaginal bleeding, make an appointment to see your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CERVICAL CANCER DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A Pap test is used to detect abnormal cells when they are in the precancerous stage. Treatment of precancerous cells of the cervix can prevent cervical cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cervical cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=follow-up-of-low-grade-abnormal-pap-tests-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Follow-up of low-grade abnormal Pap tests (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=follow-up-of-high-grade-abnormal-pap-tests-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Follow-up of high-grade abnormal Pap tests (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.) </p><p>If a Pap test shows abnormal cells, a biopsy is done to look for cancer cells. A biopsy involves removing a small piece of tissue from the cervix. The biopsy is performed during an office visit using a procedure called colposcopy. The colposcope (similar to a large magnifying lens) magnifies the view of the cervix. This allows the clinician to better see the location, extent, and degree of cervical abnormalities that may not be visible with the naked eye alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colposcopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Colposcopy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The tissue obtained during the biopsy is examined with a microscope to see if cervical cancer cells are present. In some cases, more of the cervix will need to be removed for biopsy; this is done through a procedure called cervical conization or a &quot;cone biopsy&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63427\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63427 \">figure 2</a>). This can be done either in the operating room by a surgeon using a scalpel or in the office using a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). LEEP is performed with a device that uses an electric current to remove a piece of the cervix. You will usually get the results of the biopsy one to two weeks after the biopsy is done. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-a-cervical-biopsy-with-precancerous-cells-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Management of a cervical biopsy with precancerous cells (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If your biopsy shows cervical cancer, you should see a doctor who specializes in cancers of the female reproductive system (called a gynecologic oncologist).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CERVICAL CANCER STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once cervical cancer is diagnosed, the next step is to determine the stage. Staging is a system used to describe the spread of a cancer.</p><p>Cervical cancer is staged upon the results of physical examination and imaging studies. The staging process includes a complete pelvic examination of the cervix, vagina, uterus, and ovaries. A rectal examination is usually done as well. Other procedures may also be performed to look inside your bladder (cystoscopy) or rectum (anoscopy) to see whether the cancer has spread to these areas. You may be asked to undergo computed tomography (CT) scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect whether the cancer has spread outside the pelvis or to other organs. Additional procedures may be done to see whether and where the cervical cancer has spread, although these may not change the official stage.</p><p>A cervical cancer's stage is assigned based on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The size of the cancer</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How deeply the cancer has invaded into the tissue surrounding the cervix</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there are signs of cancer in the vagina, pelvis, bladder, rectum, or local lymph nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77184\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77184 \">figure 3</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there are signs of cancer spread to distant organs (eg, the liver, lungs, or bone)</p><p/><p>Additional procedures may be done to see whether and where the cervical cancer has spread, although these may not change the official stage. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CERVICAL CANCER TREATMENT OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several options for treatment of early-stage cervical cancer. Decisions about treatment depend on the stage of the cancer, your age and health, and your and your doctor's preferences.</p><p>The most common treatment for early-stage cervical cancers is radical hysterectomy (surgical removal of the cervix, uterus, and surrounding tissues called the parametrium). The alternative is radiation therapy (RT), which is usually given in combination with chemotherapy. Some women with the earliest-stage cervical cancers can be treated with cervical conization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63427\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63427 \">figure 2</a>) or simple hysterectomy. For a simple hysterectomy, the cervix and uterus are removed, but not surrounding tissues; this is the same procedure women have for benign problems with the uterus, such as fibroids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-a-cervical-biopsy-with-precancerous-cells-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Management of a cervical biopsy with precancerous cells (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-hysterectomy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Abdominal hysterectomy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is not possible to become pregnant after having a hysterectomy or pelvic RT. In women with early-stage cervical cancer it is sometimes possible to have a less aggressive treatment (such as cervical conization), which would allow you to carry a pregnancy. These issues are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-preservation-in-women-with-early-stage-cervical-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Fertility preservation in women with early-stage cervical cancer (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Radical hysterectomy and lymph node evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radical hysterectomy is a surgical procedure that involves removing the uterus, cervix, some of the vagina, and connective tissues surrounding the cervix and uterus (parametrium; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F78941\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78941 \">figure 4</a>)). The ovaries do not necessarily have to be removed during a radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer; this decision depends upon your age and other factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-hysterectomy-beyond-the-basics#H14\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Abdominal hysterectomy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Removal of ovaries'</a>.)</p><p>At the time of radical hysterectomy, the lymph nodes in the pelvis, and sometimes higher up in the abdomen, are removed and evaluated to check for spread of cancer.</p><p>The surgery is either performed through an incision in the abdomen or can be done through several small incisions, either laparoscopically or robotically. The surgical approach depends on your and your surgeon's preference and other factors.</p><p>The surgery generally takes approximately three hours. Most women stay in the hospital for one to two days after surgery.</p><p>Some women with early-stage cervical cancer need &quot;adjuvant&quot; (additional) treatment in addition to surgery. This may include radiation and possibly chemotherapy. Adjuvant therapy is given if the tissue removed during the surgery shows risk factors for the cancer coming back after surgery. Risk factors include a large or deeply invasive tumor, or cancerous cells found in blood vessels or lymph vessels, in the surrounding tissues (parametria), at the margins (edges) of the tissue, or in lymph nodes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation therapy (RT) refers to the use of high-energy X-rays to kill the cancer cells. There are two ways to deliver radiation therapy: brachytherapy (BT) and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BT is delivered through a device that is temporarily placed in the vagina and uterus, either intermittently or continuously over several days. In some cases it may be necessary for the treatment to be delivered in the hospital, while in others it may be given in the office. BT alone is adequate treatment for the earliest-stage cervical cancers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women with more advanced disease, EBRT is generally added to BT to decrease the chance of the cancer coming back. With EBRT, the source of the radiation is outside the body. The area to be treated (referred to as the radiation &quot;field&quot;) is designed carefully to limit the amount of radiation directed at healthy tissue. During EBRT, your body is positioned beneath the X-ray machine in the same way every day, and the radiation field is exposed to the radiation beam for a few seconds (similar to having an X-ray) once per day, five days per week for five to six weeks. This is done as an outpatient procedure, and you can usually continue your normal daily activities during treatment.</p><p/><p>Side effects of RT may include effects on bowel or bladder function (eg, frequent urination), vaginal narrowing leading to painful sex, or menopause. </p><p>Ask your doctor or nurse about how to prevent or manage these side effects. To prevent vaginal narrowing, you may be advised to use a vaginal dilator. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Sexual issues after treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women who undergo EBRT for cervical cancer are given chemotherapy along with the radiation therapy (an approach termed &quot;chemoradiation&quot;). Chemotherapy drugs are medicines that stop or slow the growth of cancer cells.</p><p>Chemotherapy has the ability to enhance the damaging effect of RT on cervical cancer cells; when chemotherapy drugs are used in this manner, they are referred to as &quot;radiation sensitizers.&quot; The chemotherapy is usually given in a vein once per week during the course of EBRT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4327929\"><span class=\"h2\">Support during treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women and families affected by cervical cancer worry about their short- and long-term health and the risk of the cancer coming back. You might continue to worry for many years after treatment ends.</p><p>It is important to talk openly and honestly with your family and health care team. Many women benefit from bringing a family member or friend to doctor visits; this person can help you to understand your options, ask important questions, take notes, and feel supported.</p><p>A variety of support options are available, both during and after treatment, including individual counseling, support groups, and Internet-based discussion groups. A list of reputable groups is available below. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Where to get more information'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4327966\"><span class=\"h1\">CERVICAL CANCER PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Every person with cancer is different, and it is difficult to predict what an individual woman should expect in the future. The chances that early-stage cervical cancer can be cured are good in most cases. When discussing chances of cure, it is important to remember that these numbers represent averages and do not necessarily predict what will happen to you.</p><p>The survival rates for women with early-stage cervical cancer who have standard treatment are excellent. In the earliest stages (stage IA) at five years after diagnosis, approximately 95 percent of women are alive. This means that 5 percent of women died, although the cause of death was not necessarily related to the cancer. For slightly larger cancers (stage IB1, meaning that the cancer is confined to the cervix and smaller than 4 cm), approximately 90 percent of women are alive at five years after diagnosis. The chance of the cancer coming back or spreading to other organs and becoming life-threatening may increase if it has spread to the lymph nodes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">CERVICAL CANCER FOLLOW-UP</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After cervical cancer treatment, periodic follow-up testing and examination are recommended. There is no established schedule of testing and follow-up visits. Based on research findings and recommendations of expert groups, this is our general approach to cervical cancer follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-treatment-early-stage-cancer-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A careful physical examination every three to four months for two years, then every six months during years 3 to 5, and annually thereafter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervicovaginal cytology (Pap smear) annually.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other tests, including blood tests, pelvic ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), CT with positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are not recommended for women who have no symptoms that suggest a cancer recurrence.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Sexual issues after treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Changes after cervical cancer treatment may include vaginal shortening or narrowing, and decreased vaginal lubrication. In addition, women who were premenopausal before treatment may become postmenopausal (ie, stop having monthly periods and no longer have ovarian function) as a result of pelvic radiation, surgical removal of the ovaries, or chemotherapy. These physical changes impact sexual satisfaction because they may lead to pain during intercourse, difficulty having intercourse because of narrowing or shortening of the vagina, lack of interest in sex, and difficulty having an orgasm.</p><p>Using a vaginal moisturizer or lubricant during intercourse can relieve some of these bothersome symptoms. Your doctor may also discuss the use of hormonal therapy to alleviate some of your symptoms, but this may depend on your age at diagnosis as well as other factors. If you have radiation therapy, you may be taught how to use a vaginal dilator (a device that is placed in the vagina several times a week) to prevent shortening or narrowing. Counseling for sexual <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychological difficulties may also be helpful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-problems-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Sexual problems in women (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL TRIALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progress in treating cervical cancer requires that better treatments be identified through clinical trials, which are conducted all over the world. A clinical trial is a carefully controlled way to study the effectiveness of new treatments or new combinations of known therapies.
