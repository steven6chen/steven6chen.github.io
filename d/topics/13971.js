Traumatic events are experiences that involve serious harm or threat of harm to oneself or others, such as exposure to interpersonal violence, accidents, natural disasters, and injuries. </p><p>A majority of children and adolescents will experience a traumatic event by the time they reach adulthood, both in the United States and internationally. Although trauma exposure is common, only a minority of children who experience a traumatic event develop PTSD. PTSD is defined by four symptom clusters: intrusion, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and hyperarousal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The consequences of PTSD include elevated risk for other mental disorders and suicide, substantial impairment in role functioning, reduced social and economic opportunity, and earlier onset of chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular disease. </p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of PTSD in children are discussed here. Pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions for PTSD in children are discussed separately, as is PTSD in adults.

Although overall rates of trauma exposure are similar in boys and girls, boys are more likely to experience physical violence, whereas girls are more likely to be victims of sexual violence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. Some types of trauma occur more frequently to younger children, including physical abuse by a caregiver, witnessing domestic violence, and kidnapping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Approximately half of all children who experience these types of trauma in their lifetime have been exposed before the age of eight years. Adolescents are more likely to experience other types of trauma, including automobile accidents, rape and sexual assault, physical assault by non-family members, hospitalization for a serious injury or a relative&rsquo;s hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and unexpected death of a loved one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Certain forms of psychopathology place children at greater risk for experiencing traumatic events. In particular, youths with a history of disruptive behavior disorders (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">attention-deficit/hyperactivity</span> disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder) are more likely to experience interpersonal violence, as well as accidents and injuries, compared with children without these conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,9</a>].

Children with PTSD are vulnerable to revictimization; this association is partly mediated by problematic alcohol use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Among influential family characteristics, children who do not live with both biological parents are at heightened risk for experiencing virtually all forms of trauma, most notably interpersonal violence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,12</a>]. This pattern may reflect lower parental supervision of children in families that do not have two parents in the home, or greater risk of maltreatment because of the presence of step-parents or other nonrelated adults in the home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Other aspects of the social environment also influence risk for trauma exposure in children. Over 80 percent of children living in urban areas in the United States have experienced a traumatic event and more than half have experienced interpersonal violence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]; these rates are higher than in children living in nonurban areas. </p><p>Children living in regions experiencing humanitarian emergencies, such as war and armed conflict, are at particularly elevated risk for exposure to traumatic events. Over 15 million children were exposed to armed conflict in 2014 in the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, and Ukraine. An estimated 230 million children live in countries or regions impacted by violence and armed conflict [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Children living in areas experiencing armed conflict are at risk of internal displacement, becoming a refugee, witnessing brutal violence and death, and being orphaned, kidnapped, tortured, raped or recruited as child soldiers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Natural disasters have increased dramatically in both prevalence and associated damage over the past several decades and represent an additional source of pervasive trauma exposure worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Failure to maintain extinction learning following trauma might be the result of a relatively weak extinction memory that fails to inhibit the original fear memory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/42,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,48</a>], even in the presence of safety cues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/41,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,49</a>]. </p><p>Evidence for this model of PTSD has been observed in behavioral and neuroimaging of adults, which reveal disruptions in the structure and function of brain regions involved in fear learning and salience processing including the amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). </p><p>PTSD is specifically associated with heightened amygdala activation, reduced activity in the vmPFC and rostral ACC in response to emotional or threatening cues, and elevated activity in the dorsal ACC during fear conditioning, extinction learning recall, and response selection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/47,50-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,50-54</a>]. Reduced hippocampal volume has been consistently observed among individuals with PTSD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The extent to which these disruptions in neural function represent vulnerability markers for the disorder or consequences of trauma exposure or PTSD onset, however, is unknown. </p><p>Atypical medial prefrontal cortex function has been identified as a potential familial risk factor for PTSD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>], and reduced hippocampal volume has been observed among veterans with PTSD and their monozygotic twins discordant for trauma exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>], indicating that some of these neural differences might increase vulnerability to PTSD.</p><p>Scant neuroimaging research has been conducted in children with PTSD. However, existing studies reveal structural and functional abnormalities that are consistent with evidence from adult samples. Children with PTSD have reduced volume of vmPFC and hippocampus, elevated response in dorsal ACC to threatening cues, and reduced functional connectivity between amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. A 2014 longitudinal study found that children with greater amygdala activation to negative emotional stimuli developed greater PTSD symptoms following exposure to a terrorist attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>], replicating prior findings among adult combat veterans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. This suggests that amygdala hypersensitivity to threat might be a risk factor for the development of PTSD in children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3276263985\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrusion symptoms reflect persistent and uncontrollable thoughts, dreams, and emotional reactions about a traumatic event. These symptoms are the hallmark of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and distinguish it from other anxiety and mood disorders. Intrusive and distressing thoughts about the traumatic event are common in children with PTSD. These thoughts and memories are experienced as involuntary and uncontrollable, ie, they occur when the child does not want to think about the traumatic event. </p><p>Intrusive thoughts are frequently triggered by trauma cues: sights, sounds, smells, people, and places that remind the child of the traumatic event. In young children, intrusive thoughts can be reflected in repetitive play in which details of the traumatic event are acted out or trauma themes (eg, someone being hurt) are expressed. </p><p>Upsetting dreams and nightmares are common in children with PTSD. Although PTSD-related nightmares in adults frequently involve content that is related to the traumatic event (eg, reliving or replaying some aspect of the event), in children, nightmares often involve upsetting or frightening content that is not directly related to the traumatic event. Chronic nightmares can contribute to sleep difficulties in children with PTSD as a result of fearful awakening during or after the dream.</p><p>Additional intrusion symptoms include severe distress and physiologic reactivity in response to cues associated with the traumatic event. Trauma reminders can be both internal (eg, thoughts and memories, physical sensations that are similar to those experienced during the traumatic event) and external (eg, people, places, and sensory experiences associated with the traumatic event).</p><p>Avoidance symptoms often develop in response to distressing and uncontrollable re-experiencing symptoms. When a child experiences significant distress after being exposed to trauma-related cues, they often begin to avoid situations that remind them of the traumatic event. Avoidance of trauma reminders can manifest in two ways: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of thoughts, feelings, and memories of the traumatic event (ie, internal reminders).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of people, places, and activities associated with the traumatic event (ie, external reminders). In young children, avoidance can manifest as restricted play or reduced exploration of their environment.</p><p/><p>Changes in thoughts and emotions frequently occur in children with PTSD. A persistent change in emotional state is particularly common and can involve increases in negative emotions like fear, anger, guilt, and shame, as well as reductions in positive emotions like happiness, interest, and love. Along with reduced positive emotions, children with PTSD may exhibit diminished interest or motivation to engage in activities that they enjoyed before the traumatic event occurred. It may also be more difficult for children to feel attached and connected to significant others, resulting in feelings of detachment or estrangement. </p><p>Children may develop negative beliefs or attitudes about themselves, others, and the world. Common examples are beliefs that they are bad or have been damaged by the trauma, that other people cannot be trusted, and that the world is an unsafe place. A distorted sense of blame is also common in children with PTSD. Many children blame themselves or people close to them for the traumatic event. </p><p>A final set of core PTSD symptoms involves elevated arousal and emotional reactivity. Children may exhibit irritability, have anger outbursts, or become physically aggressive towards others more frequently than was typical for them before the traumatic event. In young children, extreme temper tantrums may become more common. These changes can interfere with peer relationships. Exaggerated emotional and physiologic reactions to unexpected or surprising stimuli, including heightened startle response, can occur among children with PTSD. Increases in risk taking are common in children with PTSD, especially in adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>Children with PTSD often exhibit concentration problems, which can interfere with their performance at school. Hypervigilance to potential threats is common, and children may become more fearful of strangers. Young children may develop separation anxiety. Finally, as noted above, sleep problems are common in children with PTSD. These can include problems falling asleep, staying asleep, or difficulty falling back to sleep after scary dreams. Young children may be afraid to sleep by themselves, even if they did not exhibit this behavior before the traumatic event. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4154694704\"><span class=\"h1\">COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The course of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly variable. Most adolescents who develop PTSD recover from the disorder, although approximately one-third experience a chronic course of illness that can last many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,65,66</a>]. This estimate is consistent across epidemiologic studies and in clinical samples of children with PTSD. As a notable example, a study that followed a sample of children who survived a landslide disaster over many years found that 29 percent still met criteria for PTSD 33 years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>Identifying factors that predict a chronic course is important to allow clinicians to deliver more intensive interventions for children and adolescents with PTSD who are least likely to recover spontaneously. Factors that predict chronic course of PTSD differ from those that predict onset of the disorder.</p><p>In a longitudinal study of over 2500 adolescents in Germany, approximately half of those with PTSD recovered three to four years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

Some symptoms are more easily linked to the traumatic event (eg, intrusive thoughts, avoidance of trauma reminders), while others are common features of a wide range of mental health problems (eg, concentration problems, irritability, negative emotional state). To determine whether the presentation is most consistent with PTSD, assessment should focus on intrusion symptoms, including intrusive thoughts, strong reactivity to trauma cues, nightmares, repetitive play; avoidance of trauma reminders; and hypervigilance.</p><p>Because avoidance of trauma reminders is a hallmark of the disorder, children may be hesitant to discuss the details of a traumatic event or trauma-related symptoms, particularly with an unfamiliar clinician. Assessing the nature and degree of exposure to trauma as well as trauma-related symptoms is often best accomplished with a parent or caregiver for young children. For older children and adolescents, trauma history and symptoms should be assessed with sensitivity.</p><p>A child PTSD assessment should include a careful suicide risk assessment as well as evaluation of anxiety disorders, externalizing behavior problems, and substance use.

Traumatic events are experiences that involve serious harm or threat of harm to oneself or others, such as exposure to interpersonal violence, accidents, natural disasters, and injuries. (See <a href=\"#H1938327113\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidemiologic studies have found high but varying rates internationally in the proportion of children and adolescents experiencing a traumatic event before the age of 18, including 62 percent in the United States, 68.9 percent in Mexico, and 18 to 26 percent in Germany, with lower rates in some high income countries. (See <a href=\"#H3383651874\" class=\"local\">'Trauma exposure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 16 percent of children exposed to a traumatic event have been found to develop PTSD. Studies have found lower rates in high income countries (approximately 8 to 10 percent), and <span class=\"nowrap\">higher/more</span> variable rates in low- and middle-income countries. (See <a href=\"#H2381127649\" class=\"local\">'Subsequent PTSD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for the development of PTSD among children exposed to trauma include a high degree of life threat, interpersonal violence or sexual abuse, and exposure to war <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> displacement. Child characteristics associated with PTSD development include female and co-occurring mental disorders: family characteristics include poor family functioning, parental PTSD, and lesser social support. (See <a href=\"#H1831557666\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of PTSD have been categorized into four clusters: intrusion, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and hyperarousal. Intrusion symptoms, which reflect persistent and uncontrollable thoughts, dreams, and emotional reactions about the traumatic event, distinguish PTSD from other anxiety and mood disorders. They are frequently triggered by trauma cues: sights, sounds, smells, people, and places that remind the child of the event. In young children, intrusive thoughts can be reflected in repetitive play. (See <a href=\"#H3276263985\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The course of PTSD is highly variable; approximately two-thirds of patients recover and one-third experience a chronic course of illness. A more chronic course is associated with poverty, co-occurring bipolar disorder, additional traumatic events after the event leading to PTSD, greater avoidance symptoms, and incident <span class=\"nowrap\">anxiety/somatoform</span> symptoms after PTSD onset. (See <a href=\"#H4154694704\" class=\"local\">'Course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Critical to a diagnostic assessment of PTSD is to determine whether the child&rsquo;s symptoms are the sequelae of a traumatic event. Assessment should focus on intrusion symptoms, including intrusive thoughts, strong reactivity to trauma cues, nightmares, repetitive play; avoidance of trauma reminders; and hypervigilance. Assessment should also include a careful suicide risk assessment as well as evaluation of anxiety disorders, externalizing behavior problems, and substance use. (See <a href=\"#H3243971647\" class=\"local\">'Assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents: Evaluation and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anxiety disorders in children and adolescents: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and course&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=substance-use-disorder-in-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Substance use disorder in adolescents: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DSM-5 includes two sets of diagnostic criteria for PTSD: one applicable to children age six years and older (and adults), and the other for children under six years. The criteria for younger children have a lower threshold for the diagnosis consistent with the disorder. The criteria are organized by four core clusters of intrusion, avoidance, negative <span class=\"nowrap\">cognition/mood,</span> and hyperarousal.
