(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic apheresis (plasma exchange or cytapheresis): Indications and technology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These devices permit selective cell removal (cytapheresis) but have been associated with posttreatment thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasmapheresis-with-hemodialysis-equipment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and require a dedicated centrifuge device. An increasingly popular and often more efficient alternative is to perform plasma exchange by membrane plasma separation (MPS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasmapheresis-with-hemodialysis-equipment/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].</p><p>MPS utilizes a highly permeable membrane and a standard dialysis machine used in its ultrafiltration mode, dialysis-bypass mode (similar to the technique in hemoperfusion). TPE is also possible using NxStage and Prismaflex continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) machines. The NxStage machine employs a cartridge that uses the Plasmaflo OP-05H as the filtration membrane. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Technical considerations'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-daily-home-hemodialysis-the-low-dialysate-volume-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short daily home hemodialysis: The low dialysate volume approach&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For many years, the most commonly used membrane in the United States was the Plasmaflo AP-05H. This filter has been replaced with a slightly more porous filter, the OP-05W [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasmapheresis-with-hemodialysis-equipment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This filter can be used with most dialysis machines, but the Cobe 3 and Hospal machines are incompatible with the filter's tubing.</p><p>The published American experience with MPS is very limited even though thousands of treatments are performed in the United States each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasmapheresis-with-hemodialysis-equipment/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. In some countries, such as Germany and Japan, 90 percent of plasmapheresis treatments are performed by membrane plasma separation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasmapheresis-with-hemodialysis-equipment/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Plasmaflo filter should be operated with a very modest transmembrane pressure (recommended TMP &lt;75 mmHg, although the maximum TMP for the OP-05W is listed as 100 mmHg) and blood flow (50 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> in order to minimize the tendency to hemolysis and filter clotting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasmapheresis-with-hemodialysis-equipment/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]. Limiting TMP can be most easily achieved by limiting blood flow and by regulating filtrate output via use of a double roller pump on the filtrate output of the filter. This double pump also regulates the infusion of replacement fluid (such as albumin or fresh-frozen plasma), matching its rate of return to the volume of plasma removed, thereby eliminating the risk of hypotension or fluid overload.</p><p>Manufacturers generally recommend a filtration fraction of less than 20 percent. The plasma replacement rate should equal plasma removal rate.</p><p>It is important to appreciate that rapid removal and infusion of protein-containing solutions produce volume changes that are essentially limited to the intravascular compartment. Thus, even small mismatches in net plasma removal rate will have a far greater effect on systemic blood pressure than would be produced by an equivalent water shift during standard hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasmapheresis-with-hemodialysis-equipment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The protein permeable membranes, such as the Plasmaflo, are very susceptible to concentration polarization, a phenomenon whereby protein layering on the inner surface of the membrane rapidly limits the maximum achievable filtration rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasmapheresis-with-hemodialysis-equipment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As a result, inappropriately high TMPs will not yield higher filtration rates, but will increase the tendency for the filter to clog (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F52183\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52183 \">figure 1</a>). Dialysis nursing issues have been the subject of several reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasmapheresis-with-hemodialysis-equipment/abstract/11,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6472987\"><span class=\"h2\">Biocompatibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing of the OP-05W reveals a potential for increased bradykinin levels, and it would be wise to discontinue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in any patient who is to be treated with this membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasmapheresis-with-hemodialysis-equipment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) treatments performed with standard centrifugal devices use citrate anticoagulation. Although this technique can be modified for use with a membrane plasma separation (MPS) system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasmapheresis-with-hemodialysis-equipment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], most MPS treatments are performed with heparin. Initial recommendations are to start with a heparin dose of 5000 units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasmapheresis-with-hemodialysis-equipment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] or 40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasmapheresis-with-hemodialysis-equipment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] followed by a maintenance dose approximately 1000 units per hour. The heparin dose should be increased when the hematocrit is reduced. In this setting, there is a relative increase in plasma volume removal (since more of the blood is composed of plasma), leading to enhanced removal of heparin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasmapheresis-with-hemodialysis-equipment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Patients in whom fresh-frozen plasma is used as the replacement fluid can develop further anticoagulation and citrate toxicity since fresh-frozen plasma is 14 percent citrate by volume. Citrate toxicity is most likely to occur when citrate clearance is diminished due to hepatic or renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasmapheresis-with-hemodialysis-equipment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TPE can be performed with any vascular access compatible with standard hemodialysis since the blood-flow requirements are modest. Standard TPE with centrifugal devices can often be performed with bilateral antecubital vein catheters. This approach is less likely to be successful with an MPS system, in which the blood-flow rate is frequently between 100 and 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. However, removal of a larger catheter, such as a large bore, double-lumen catheter, is potentially hazardous after an intensive run of TPE due to a substantial &quot;depletion&quot; coagulopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasmapheresis-with-hemodialysis-equipment/abstract/12,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,18</a>].
