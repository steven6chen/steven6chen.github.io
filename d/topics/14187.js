But it's important to think about this issue before your child starts cancer treatment. That's because some types of cancer treatments can cause fertility problems, even years later.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196197949\"><span class=\"h1\">Which cancer treatments can cause fertility problems?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer treatments that can cause fertility problems include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; Radiation involves getting high doses of X-rays.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; If the sex organs are removed or damaged during treatment, girls won't be able to get pregnant or will have trouble getting pregnant later in life. Or boys won't be able to father a child or will have trouble fathering a child later in life. The sex organs include the testicles (in boys) and the ovaries and uterus (in girls) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F68075\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68075 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p>Both chemotherapy and radiation can damage cells in the male and female sex organs.</p><p>But not everyone who gets chemotherapy or radiation will have fertility problems. With chemotherapy, it depends on the medicine and dose a person gets. With radiation, it depends on the dose and part of the body treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196198009\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do if I want to preserve my child's fertility?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should talk with your child's doctor <strong>BEFORE</strong> your child starts cancer treatment. Treatments that have a lower chance of affecting future fertility might be available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196198024\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there other ways to preserve fertility?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. They depend on your child's sex and whether he or she has gone through puberty.</p><p>For boys and girls who have not yet gone through puberty, the main way to preserve fertility is to shield the sex organs during radiation treatment. This involves wearing a special type of shield on the outside of the body. The shield covers and protects the sex organs, so they aren't damaged by the radiation.</p><p>For boys who have gone through puberty, ways of preserving fertility can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shielding the testicles during radiation treatment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sperm banking &ndash; This involves collecting and freezing sperm before cancer treatment starts. To collect the sperm, your child will need to ejaculate. If he can't, or if there is no sperm in the semen, the doctor can do a procedure to remove sperm from the testicle. After the sperm is collected, it is frozen and stored until needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Freezing and storing small pieces of tissue from the testicle &ndash; Doctors are still testing this procedure to see if it works.</p><p/><p>For girls who have gone through puberty, ways of preserving fertility can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shielding the ovaries or uterus during radiation treatment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moving the ovaries &ndash; If a girl's ovaries are in the path of the radiation, the doctor can do surgery to move them slightly to keep them from getting damaged.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Freezing and storing eggs or small pieces of tissue from the ovary</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196198039\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I decide which option is right for my child?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best way to preserve your child's fertility depends on your child's cancer, treatment, age, and individual situation. Talk with your child's doctor about the possible choices. To make your decision, you might want to think about:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The benefits and downsides of the choices</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How well the doctor thinks they will work</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much they cost &ndash; For example, it costs money to collect, freeze, and store sperm. Health insurance sometimes pays for these things.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196198056\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hodgkin lymphoma in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukemia-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Leukemia in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-sexual-development-puberty-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Normal sexual development (puberty) (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
