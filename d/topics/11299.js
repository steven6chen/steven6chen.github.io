These requirements are currently best met by both primary arteriovenous (AV) fistulas and synthetic grafts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chronic hemodialysis vascular access&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Issues surrounding monitoring and surveillance of hemodialysis AV grafts in the attempt to prevent thrombosis and graft failure are presented in this topic review. Similar issues for hemodialysis AV fistulas are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-monitoring-and-surveillance-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical monitoring and surveillance of the mature hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H182036759\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE FOR MONITORING AND SURVEILLANCE OF ARTERIOVENOUS GRAFTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The assessment of hemodialysis AV grafts for stenosis is performed using clinical monitoring and noninvasive surveillance methods. Unfortunately, the ability to detect stenotic lesions does not necessarily mean that clinical outcomes are improved, such as a decreased rate of thrombosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> improved graft survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>More than 90 percent of thrombosed grafts have a stenotic lesion, suggesting that such an anatomic abnormality is required for graft thrombosis. Noninvasive monitoring methods have a relatively high positive predictive value (PPV) for detecting &gt;50 percent graft stenosis. A randomized, controlled trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] found that abnormalities detected by clinical monitoring had a 70 percent PPV for hemodynamically significant AV graft stenosis compared with Duplex ultrasound, which had an 80 percent PPV. However, in general, fewer than half of grafts with &gt;50 percent stenosis are destined to thrombose in the absence of preemptive angioplasty. Any type of program to preemptively identify and treat stenosis necessarily results in a substantial number of superfluous angioplasties. To complicate matters, the vascular injury resulting from angioplasty may actually stimulate neointimal hyperplasia and accelerate graft restenosis and potentially graft loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical monitoring refers to assessments that can be performed by physical examination of the access or by using readily available information that is collected in the course of treating dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A number of studies have observed that a hemodynamically significant (&gt;50 percent) stenosis is present in approximately 70 to 90 percent of patients identified to have abnormalities of clinical monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/2,5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5-9</a>]. The major advantages of clinical monitoring are it is free, it does not require additional equipment or personnel, and it can be performed by multiple staff members.</p><p>Clinical monitoring falls into the following three broad categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormalities of physical examination, such as absent thrill, discontinuous bruit, or edema in the extremity distal to the graft. In one study, an abnormality of physical examination had an 80 percent positive predictive value (PPV) for significant graft stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-arteriovenous-graft\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the arteriovenous graft&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems noted during the dialysis session, such as difficulty with cannulation, aspiration of clots, inability to achieve the target dialysis blood flow, or prolonged bleeding from the needle puncture sites. An abnormality noted during the dialysis session had a 66 percent PPV for significant graft stenosis in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The PPV was 76 percent for prolonged bleeding from the needle puncture site, 58 percent for difficulty in cannulation, but only 30 percent for aspiration of clots.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An unexplained decrease in the delivered dialysis dose <span class=\"nowrap\">(Kt/V)</span> on a constant hemodialysis prescription. An unexplained (&gt;0.2 units) decrease in <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> had a 69 percent PPV for significant graft stenosis in the abovementioned study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SURVEILLANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To overcome the limitations of clinical monitoring, a number of noninvasive surveillance methods have been developed. Unlike clinical monitoring, each of these methods requires specialized equipment or specially trained staff. Each method relies on the observation that progressive graft stenosis results in an increase in intragraft pressure (normalized for systemic blood pressure) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a decrease in access blood flow. Access surveillance is more consistent and reproducible compared with clinical monitoring, but surveillance programs require additional costs that are not reimbursed in the United States. Thus, to justify this added expense, these approaches must demonstrate that their use is associated with improved graft patency.</p><p>The three main types of access surveillance are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intra-access blood flow monitoring</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Static dialysis venous pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duplex ultrasound</p><p/><p>Flow monitoring is generally favored over static dialysis venous pressure, which is the least used method in the United States because it is highly operator dependent.</p><p>Although flow monitoring is not as accurate as duplex ultrasound, information can be obtained at the bedside in the hemodialysis unit, whereas duplex ultrasound is generally performed elsewhere (eg, hospital or outpatient vascular laboratory). Thus, when we elect to use surveillance, we select flow monitoring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Intra-access blood flow monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intra-access blood flow can be measured using several different methods. The published literature suggests that all the methods of flow monitoring yield largely similar values. Dialysis access blood flow measurements are typically performed monthly.</p><p>Among the available methods, the most commonly used flow-monitoring technique is ultrasound dilution, which quantifies access blood flow by injecting ice-cold saline via the dialysis needle after reversing the dialysis lines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A sensor measures the rate of increase in temperature following the injection and uses this information to calculate the access flow rate. Access flows &lt;600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> or a &gt;25 percent decrease in access flow from the baseline value are suspicious for the presence of hemodynamically significant stenosis. Two prospective studies found that patients with such abnormal access blood flows had an 87 to 100 percent positive predictive value (PPV) for significant stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. When flow monitoring is used, a fistulogram should be obtained if the flow is &lt;600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> or &gt;25 percent lower from baseline. However, given the variability of flow measurements, low values should be confirmed before sending a patient for a fistulogram.</p><p>Other methods for obtaining graft blood flow include dilution based on urea or thermal techniques, glucose pump infusion techniques, differential conductivity, duplex ultrasound, and magnetic resonance angiography.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Duplex ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Duplex ultrasonography is probably the most reproducible and accurate AV graft surveillance method. Although portable ultrasound units are available for use in a variety of other clinical situations, limitations in the dialysis unit include a lack of staff in the hemodialysis unit trained to use them and lack of reimbursement of the procedure in this setting, at least in the United States.</p><p>Duplex ultrasonography measures the peak systolic velocity (PSV) on either side of an area of visual stenosis. The ratio of PSVs measured across the stenotic lesion is calculated. A PSV ratio &gt;2.0 is suspicious for significant stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. In addition, duplex ultrasound can be used to estimate the access blood flow as corroborating evidence for the PSV ratio. In one prospective study, a PSV ratio &gt;2.0 was associated with a significant stenosis in 80 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Static venous dialysis pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With static venous dialysis pressure, the intragraft pressure is measured using a manometer connected to the dialysis needle prior to turning on the dialysis pump. The reading is normalized to the systemic systolic blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. A ratio of intragraft to systemic pressure &lt;0.4 is considered normal, whereas a ratio &gt;0.6 is suspicious for significant stenosis. Values between 0.4 and 0.6 require repeated measurements for trend analysis. A large, prospective study found that abnormal static dialysis venous pressures had a 92 percent PPV for significant stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H182037055\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTIVENESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, the majority of thrombosed grafts have an underlying stenosis. Detection of significant stenosis in a timely fashion and preemptive treatment could reduce the frequency of graft thrombosis, and, since thrombosis is the major cause of graft failure, such an approach could improve graft longevity. (See <a href=\"#H182036759\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for monitoring and surveillance of arteriovenous grafts'</a> above.)</p><p>The bulk of the evidence from observational studies and randomized trials suggests that surveillance with preemptive angioplasty for stenosis does <strong>not</strong> decrease the frequency of subsequent graft thrombosis or improve graft patency.</p><p>The impact of graft surveillance on access outcomes was evaluated in six trials. Surveillance methods included duplex ultrasound in four studies, access flow in two studies, and static dialysis venous pressure in one study (one study included two different surveillance methods) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/1,2,11,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,11,15-17</a>]. In contrast to the observational studies, none of these trials showed any benefit for graft surveillance in reducing the rate of graft thrombosis, and only one of these observed an increase in graft patency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/1,2,11,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,11,15-17</a>]. Earlier observational studies had noted an approximately 40 to 80 percent reduction in graft thrombosis after introducing monitoring or surveillance protocols that included clinical monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/6,8,9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,9,13</a>], static dialysis venous pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and duplex ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis of 12 trials found no effect for graft surveillance (compared with historic controls) on the risk of AV graft thrombosis (relative risk [RR] 0.94, 95% CI 0.77-1.16; 446 participants) or access loss (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.83-1.40) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. at best, graft surveillance with preemptive angioplasty could decrease graft thrombosis up to 23 percent, which is a more modest benefit than was noted in the observational studies. However, it could increase graft thrombosis by as much as 16 percent.</p><p>Possible reasons for these results include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benefits may be limited to relatively new grafts. This is supported by an observational study for which the benefit of graft surveillance and preemptive angioplasty was greatest in grafts less than three months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombosis-free graft survival may be most likely observed in grafts without a previous intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There may be an insufficient opportunity to noninvasively detect the stenosis due to the rapid progression of the lesion in grafts with early thrombosis. This is supported by the 20 to 25 percent false-negative rate observed with graft surveillance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benefits may be very short lived due perhaps to restenosis after angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/3,12,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12,24</a>]. Whether or not stenting or stent-grafting might improve long-term graft patency is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Thus, we rely primarily on clinical monitoring and do not use any graft surveillance methods.</p><p>Our dialysis staff performs routine physical examination of the graft weekly, noting any abnormalities during the dialysis session.

These abnormal values should be confirmed before proceeding to a fistulogram.</p><p>However, the proficiency and motivation of dialysis staff to perform such clinical monitoring may vary. When clinical monitoring alone is used, suboptimal detection of graft stenosis can occur, as evidenced in several randomized trials that found that clinical monitoring alone was associated with an angioplasty rate ranging from 0 to 0.64 events per patient-year, which is low compared with other surveillance methods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">KDOQI RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For surveillance of grafts, the 2006 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines recommend the techniques listed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].
