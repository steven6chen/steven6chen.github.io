The surgeon should use this time to review the patient's history and physical examination, identify physical limitations, gather information required to plan surgery, optimize medical status, and educate about what to expect from the procedure and during the recovery period.</p><p>Many postoperative problems can be anticipated preoperatively, and eliminated or minimized; systematically addressing these issues at the preoperative evaluation may result in a shorter hospitalization with fewer complications and a more satisfied patient. The surgeon may also rethink the aggressiveness and necessity of a planned operative procedure after thoughtful discussion with patients who have severe medical problems. As an example, a woman with symptomatic congestive heart failure and uterine procidentia may be better served with a pessary than by vaginal hysterectomy and sacrospinous suspension. This discussion is mainly regarding scheduled surgery. Urgent cases require an expedited preoperative evaluation process to provide appropriate care. </p><p>The preoperative evaluation and preparation of women for gynecologic surgery will be reviewed here. General principles of preoperative evaluation and preparation are discussed separately.

For some procedures, particularly those that have variable outcomes and impact quality of life (eg, pelvic organ prolapse repair), patient expectations and goals should be discussed in detail. The expected duration and requirements of the recovery period should also be reviewed. Anticipatory guidance during preoperative office visits will enhance a patient's acceptance and compliance during the immediate postoperative period and may help to shorten hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The surgeon should confirm that the patient has understood the discussion and desires to proceed with the procedure. This discussion should be documented in the medical record and on the procedure consent form. </p><p>Informed consent is discussed in detail separately, including issues related to incompetent or incapacitated patients, adolescent patients, and issues regarding patients who refuse blood transfusion.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=body-piercing-in-adolescents-and-young-adults#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Body piercing in adolescents and young adults&quot;, section on 'Removal'</a>.)</p><p>The presence of umbilical jewelry, such as rings, is relatively common in women. Our preference is to have the patient remove the ring the day prior to the procedure and cleanse the umbilicus thoroughly. An alternative approach is temporary removal of the jewelry and replacement with a nonmetallic spacer (eg, sterile plastic sutures or thin tubing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

After reviewing existing guidelines and evidence-based recommendations, the Council released practice recommendations for a patient care bundle that, while aimed at preventing SSI in women undergoing hysterectomy, can be applied to all gynecologic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The bundle is divided into four domains: readiness, recognition and prevention, response, and reporting and systems learning. Key features include patient education, assessment of preoperative patient risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F111504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111504 \">table 4</a>), standardization of perioperative antibiotics and normothermia, and data collection and evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F111507\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111507 \">table 5</a>). One limitation of this approach is that the specific intervention(s) that resulted in the decreased infection rate are not known, and therefore the entire package of interventions must be implemented in order to reduce infection.</p><p>As an example of a bundled intervention and its impact from the gynecologic surgery literature, a retrospective review of 825 open gynecologic cancer surgeries for uterine or ovarian cancer reported the overall risk of SSI dropped 82 percent after initiation of an SSI intervention bundle, with the absolute percent of cases dropping from 6 to 1.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Preintervention steps to reduce SSI included patient education, 4% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> gluconate shower before surgery, antibiotic administration, preoperative skin preparation with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 70% isopropyl alcohol, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> re-dosing three to four hours after incision. The bundled intervention consisted of these elements plus sterile closing tray and staff glove change for fascia and skin closure, dressing removal at 24 to 48 hours postoperatively, patient shower with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate after dressing removal, and a follow-up nursing phone call. Of note, approximately 40 percent of women undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer required bowel resection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17330349\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotics should be given to prevent SSI prior to gynecologic surgery or procedures that enter the reproductive tract (eg, hysterectomy) or are likely to contaminate the peritoneal cavity from the vagina (eg, surgical abortion, hysterosalpingogram). Guidelines are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87200\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87200 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>The efficacy of the preferred beta-lactam antimicrobial regimens (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefoxitin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefoxitin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotetan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotetan</a>) was supported by a retrospective cohort study of over 21,000 women undergoing hysterectomy (abdominal, vaginal, laparoscopic, and robotic) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The women who received either alternative antibiotic regimens (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> or quinolone) or nonstandard regimens had a higher risk of SSI compared with women who received preferred preoperative antibiotics (SSI odds ratio of 1.7 for alternative beta-lactam regimens and 2.0 for nonstandard antibiotic regimens). In contrast, a subsequent retrospective cohort study of over 18,000 women undergoing hysterectomy (all types) reported an increased risk of surgical site infection in women receiving either cefazolin or second-generation cephalosporin agents compared with women receiving cefazolin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> (adjusted odds ratio 2.3 for both) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, we will continue to use preoperative beta-lactam antibiotics (eg, cefazolin) unless prospective comparative trial data become available that compel a change in guidelines because of concerns that more broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage could contribute to increased antibiotic resistance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87200\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87200 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>General principles of SSI prevention have been published by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/HAI/ssi/ssi.html&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsSJG6tmdZJUHbCLKFfynVKCkQk6OtYqIKJq2MKW+Zi9m&amp;TOPIC_ID=3301\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> and are reviewed separately.

While PVP-I is commonly used in the United States for vaginal preparation, chlorhexidine is commonly used elsewhere because it may provide a greater reduction in skin flora than PVP-I and is not inactivated in the presence of blood. Despite common use of chlorhexidine gluconate with 4 percent isopropyl alcohol outside of the United States, the manufacturer's label states that chlorhexidine gluconate is for external use only and should not be used in genital areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Generalized allergic reactions, irritation, and sensitivity have been reported.

In our practice, if a saline preparation is used and the peritoneal cavity is entered, we use prophylactic antibiotics and irrigate the field thoroughly at the conclusion of the case.

Based on the ACCP guidelines, surgical patients are classified into risk categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F83739\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83739 \">table 8</a>). Use of thromboprophylaxis is then guided by the risk category.

These factors are included in the risk classification. </p><p>The ACCP guidelines differ somewhat from the guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Both guidelines define a minor procedure as lasting less than 30 minutes, however, the ACCP differentiates between open and laparoscopic surgery, effectively classifying all entirely laparoscopic procedures as minor (regardless of duration or complexity). The ACOG guidelines divide patients into risk categories according to duration of surgery, age cut-offs (&lt;40 years, 40 to 60 years, and &gt;60 years), and individual VTE risk factors that are either not evidence-based or are based on data which are 25 or more years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Regarding laparoscopic surgery, some of the considerations are that abdominal wall tissue trauma is decreased with a laparoscopic approach, but activation of the coagulation system is similar to laparotomy. In addition, laparoscopic procedures may be as long or longer than open surgeries, and the use of pneumoperitoneum and reverse Trendelenburg contribute to venous stasis and, possibly, thrombosis. However, patients regain mobility more rapidly after laparoscopy compared with laparotomy.</p><p>There are no high-quality studies which have addressed the question of thromboprophylaxis for gynecologic laparoscopy. In a retrospective study of over 10,000 women after hysterectomy, the rate of women who received thromboprophylaxis varied somewhat for those undergoing a laparoscopic, abdominal, or vaginal procedure (22, 38, or 47 percent, respectively); the incidence of VTE for the three procedures did not differ significantly (0.3, 0.2 or 0.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Another retrospective review of over 800 patients who underwent gynecologic laparoscopy for benign or malignant indications reported that the rate of VTE increased with increasing complexity of the procedure: low (diagnostic laparoscopy; no VTE events); intermediate (ovarian cystectomy, salpingo-oophorectomy, tubal ligation, hysterectomy; 0.5 percent); and high (radical hysterectomy, lymphadenectomy, splenectomy, small <span class=\"nowrap\">bowel/colon</span> resection; 2.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Interestingly, malignancy was not significantly associated with an increased risk of VTE, but this was likely because there were only six VTE events.
