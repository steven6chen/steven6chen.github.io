Prior to the availability of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), CMV gastrointestinal disease occurred in up to 5 percent of patients with AIDS, primarily in those with advanced immunosuppression. However, the incidence of CMV gastrointestinal disease has decreased substantially since ART became available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-antiretroviral-regimens-for-the-treatment-naive-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting antiretroviral regimens for the treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A discussion of the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of other CMV-related diseases in HIV-infected patients is found elsewhere.

CMV gastrointestinal disease was first reported as a manifestation of AIDS in 1983. In early case series, patients generally died within several months without CMV-specific treatment, and hemorrhage or perforation often complicated the course of disease. The prognosis of such patients remained poor despite the advent of antiviral drugs for the treatment of CMV. As an example, the median survival was reported to be four months after the diagnosis of CMV colitis and eight months after CMV esophagitis, even with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. However, as with all HIV-related opportunistic infections, the prognosis has improved markedly with the utilization of antiretroviral therapy (ART). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Impact of ART'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90048829\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of CMV disease occur in the setting of advanced immunosuppression, with CD4 cell counts &lt; 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The presence of CMV in blood (as measured by culture, CMV DNA amplification, or antigen detection) is also a risk factor for the development of invasive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, patients with viremia may not have invasive disease.

Most cases of end organ disease now occur in patients who are not receiving ART, either due to late diagnosis of HIV disease or poor adherence to prescribed therapy.</p><p>A large multicenter prospective European cohort examined the incidence and prognosis of invasive CMV disease in patients with AIDS during the pre- and post-ART eras [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A total of 707 of 8,556 patients had CMV disease diagnosed at either recruitment or at a follow-up visit: 449 with retinitis, 164 with gastrointestinal disease and 58 with concurrent retinitis and extraocular disease. The number of new cases of CMV related gastrointestinal disease significantly declined after the introduction of ART; 61 cases were diagnosed from 1994 to 1995 and 9 cases were diagnosed from 1998-2001. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common sites of CMV related gastrointestinal involvement are the esophagus and the colon. Symptom presentation depends on the anatomic location of the infection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Esophagitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMV esophagitis presents with odynophagia and may be accompanied by fever, nausea, or substernal burning pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. CMV most commonly causes multiple ulcers at the lower esophageal sphincter, but diffuse esophagitis is also described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMV gastritis presents with substernal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> epigastric burning pain. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage is a rare manifestation of CMV disease at this site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Enteritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMV infection of the small bowel accounts for approximately 4 percent of all CMV infections of the gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. CMV enteritis is manifested clinically by generalized abdominal pain and diarrhea. Rare reports of dyspepsia and ileal perforation secondary to CMV have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Colitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMV colitis is the second most common manifestation of end organ disease after CMV retinitis. CMV colitis is associated with low-grade fever, weight loss, anorexia, malaise, and abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Explosive watery diarrhea is common, but can be sporadic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Symptoms that suggest distal large bowel involvement include frequent small volume diarrhea, tenesmus, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hematochezia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Extensive mucosal hemorrhage and perforation can be life-threatening complications. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMV can rarely cause large, painful ulcers of the mouth, pharynx, or anus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In the oropharynx, these ulcers may be mistaken for aphthous ulcers or herpes simplex erosions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a patient with suspected CMV gastrointestinal disease, the diagnosis is based upon the following triad: clinical symptoms of gastrointestinal disease, visualization of characteristic lesions on endoscopy, and intranuclear or cytoplasmic inclusions on pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A definitive diagnosis should be made in most settings, since empiric anti-CMV therapy can be associated with significant toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H106768609\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5585589\"><span class=\"h2\">When to suspect CMV gastrointestinal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of CMV gastrointestinal disease should be suspected in patients with CD4 cell counts &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> who present with symptoms of esophagitis, gastritis, enteritis, or colitis. This diagnosis is most likely to occur in patients not receiving antiretroviral therapy. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>Often, such symptoms have an alternate explanation. An approach to the evaluation of HIV-infected patients with these symptoms is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-odynophagia-and-dysphagia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the HIV-infected patient with odynophagia and dysphagia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-diarrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the HIV-infected patient with diarrhea&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We suggest endoscopy and biopsy to diagnose CMV disease in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the evaluation for more common causes of gastrointestinal disease is unrevealing. As an example, patients with persistent diarrhea should undergo endoscopy when stool studies for enteric pathogens and ova and parasites are negative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When empiric therapy for a more common etiology is not effective. As an example, patients with esophagitis are often treated empirically for candidiasis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> before evaluating other etiologies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As part of the initial evaluation in severely symptomatic patients who require hospitalization. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74654095\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopy provides visual information that supports a diagnosis of CMV and also provides the opportunity to obtain tissue for pathology. The endoscopic presentation of CMV can vary depending upon the location of disease. CMV esophagitis and gastritis appear as large shallow ulcers or erosions; the appearance of CMV colitis can range from punctate and superficial erosions to deep ulcerations and necrotizing colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/7,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,20</a>]. Biopsies should be taken from erosions or ulcers to make a definitive diagnosis. CMV inclusions can be seen in normal gastrointestinal mucosa in patients with advanced AIDS, but this does not correlate with clinical symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74654356\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMV gastrointestinal disease is characterized histologically by mucosal inflammation, tissue necrosis, as well as vascular endothelial cell damage and the presence of intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions. The characteristic cytomegalic cells (large cells containing eosinophilic intranuclear and frequently basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions) are present in mucosal biopsies stained with hematoxylin and eosin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52984\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52984 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In patients with severe colitis, cytomegalic inclusions can be seen in areas of perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5585717\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of CMV in blood or tissue <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a positive CMV antibody does not confirm a diagnosis of CMV disease in patients with HIV and advanced immunosuppression. As an example, in a study of patients with advanced AIDS and CMV viremia detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fewer than 50 percent developed CMV end organ disease at one year despite receiving no anti-CMV therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5585748\"><span class=\"h3\">Viral detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood tests to detect CMV by antigen detection, culture, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are not recommended in patients with AIDS because they cannot confirm or exclude the presence of end-organ disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In addition, positive CMV cultures of mucosal brushings or biopsies are not diagnostic because a substantial number of patients with low CD4 cell counts may have positive cultures in the absence of clinical disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/19,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74654403\"><span class=\"h3\">Serology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMV antibody is typically not useful in confirming AIDS-related CMV disease. However, CMV gastrointestinal disease is rare in AIDS patients who are CMV seronegative because infection results from reactivation of latent virus; thus, a negative serology suggests an alternate etiology for their symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-cytomegalovirus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the diagnosis of cytomegalovirus infection&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16630131\"><span class=\"h2\">Ophthalmologic evaluation in all patients with CMV disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with extraocular CMV disease often have concurrent CMV retinitis. As a result, any patient diagnosed with CMV gastrointestinal disease should have formal ophthalmologic screening for retinitis. If the initial examination is negative, it should be repeated if any visual symptoms occur, or at six-month intervals until the patient's absolute CD4 cell count has been restored to &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> by antiretroviral therapy.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis#H101636402\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of AIDS-related cytomegalovirus retinitis&quot;, section on 'When to initiate antiretroviral therapy'</a>.)</p><p>The initiation of ART results in immune recovery, and is an important adjunct in the treatment of opportunistic infections, including those with CMV retinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. However, ART can produce an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in the eye of patients with CMV retinitis, resulting in visual loss. IRIS has not been seen in patients with isolated gastrointestinal disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of AIDS-related cytomegalovirus retinitis&quot;, section on 'CMV immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintenance therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic maintenance therapy is not recommended for CMV gastrointestinal disease unless there is concurrent retinitis or recurrent gastrointestinal disease after induction therapy has been discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Low quality data in patients without retinitis suggest that maintenance therapy does not prevent relapse or improve survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>Patients with recurrent gastrointestinal disease should be reinduced prior to initiation of maintenance therapy (see <a href=\"#H106768617\" class=\"local\">'Induction therapy'</a> above). After successful induction, maintenance therapy consists of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a>, 900 mg given once daily, a dose that is effective in patients with CMV retinitis. There are no guidelines regarding when to discontinue maintenance in patients with relapsed GI disease. We suggest discontinuing treatment in patients who have sustained CD4 cell counts &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> for six months or longer on ART. </p><p>A detailed discussion of maintenance therapy for patients with CMV retinitis is found elsewhere.

However, the likelihood is increased in patients who have had prior exposure to anti-CMV agents, and in those who have not achieved adequate serum drug levels (eg, due to poor adherence or absorption). If drug resistance is suspected, we send serum for CMV PCR. Genotype testing for drug resistance can be done to help guide therapy if the serum CMV PCR is positive. If the PCR is negative, or genotypic testing shows no evidence of resistance, a repeat work-up including biopsy should be done. (See <a href=\"#H260731795\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients with suspected drug-resistance based upon a detectable CMV DNA, we suggest combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">foscarnet</a> (rather than monotherapy with the alternative induction agent) while awaiting the results of genotypic resistance testing. If resistance is confirmed, we continue combination therapy for six weeks. These suggestions are based upon data from the treatment of CMV retinitis; there are no studies of drug-resistant CMV gastrointestinal disease. </p><p>We do <strong>not</strong> recommend using alternative agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cidofovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cidofovir</a>, unless combination <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">foscarnet</a> therapy has failed or the patient is intolerant of these medications.
