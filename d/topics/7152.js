FGR resulting from intrinsic fetal factors such as aneuploidy, congenital malformations, or infection carries a guarded prognosis that often cannot be improved by any intervention. FGR related to uteroplacental insufficiency has a better prognosis, but the risk for adverse outcome remains increased.</p><p>This topic will discuss the evaluation and management of pregnancies complicated by FGR. The diagnosis of FGR and outcome of affected infants are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal growth restriction: Diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infants with fetal (intrauterine) growth restriction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL APPROACH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10977003\"><span class=\"h2\">Confirm the diagnosis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4030044558\"><span class=\"h3\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of FGR is based on discrepancies between actual and expected sonographic biometric measurements for a given gestational age. Traditionally, it has been defined as &lt;10<sup>th</sup> percentile weight for gestational age on a singleton growth curve, as this establishes the diagnosis as being small for gestational age (SGA). In our practice, when a fetus &lt;10<sup>th</sup> percentile weight for gestational age is identified, we monitor fetal growth and fetal physiology over time. A normal growth trajectory, normal Doppler velocimetry of the umbilical artery, and normal amniotic fluid volume suggest a constitutionally small fetus or minimal fetal impact from uteroplacental insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy management'</a> below.)</p><p>A weight &lt;10<sup>th</sup> percentile definition is clinically practical, but it alone does not distinguish the constitutionally small fetus that achieves its normal growth potential and is not at increased risk of adverse outcome from the similarly small fetus whose growth potential is restricted and is at increased risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality. This definition also does not account for the fetus who is not small for gestational age but is not achieving its growth potential because of intrinsic or environmental restrictions to normal growth. Distinguishing the constitutionally small fetus from the fetus with pathologic growth restriction is the first challenge for the clinician. This knowledge can help to avoid unnecessary interventions for pregnancies with a constitutionally small fetus and lead to appropriate monitoring and delivery timing of the growth-restricted fetus. </p><p>Characteristics that support a diagnosis of a constitutionally small fetus include modest smallness (ie, estimated weight between the 5<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> percentiles), normal growth velocity across gestation, normal physiology (ie, normal amniotic fluid volume and umbilical artery Doppler), abdominal circumference growth velocity above the lowest decile, and appropriate size in relation to maternal characteristics (height, weight, <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity),</span> which have a major influence on fetal growth potential. For example, when <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity</span> was taken into account, the 5<sup>th</sup> percentiles for white, Hispanic, black, and Asian women were 2790, 2633, 2622, and 2621 grams, respectively, in a prospective study of 2334 healthy women with low-risk, singleton pregnancies from 12 medical centers in the United States. Using biometric standards derived solely from the group of white fetuses, as many as 15 percent of the non-white fetuses would have been classified as growth-restricted (&lt;5<sup>th</sup> percentile) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>It is also important to distinguish normal from aberrant growth when considering dichorionic twin gestations. Growth is similar to that of singleton pregnancies until 32 weeks of gestation, at which point growth velocity patterns differ: abdominal circumference growth velocity in twins slows. If singleton growth standards were applied to the evaluation of dichorionic twins, close to 40 percent would be classified as small for gestational age near term. It is also not unusual to observe discordant growth in dichorionic twins. In this setting, it is important to evaluate growth velocity and umbilical artery Doppler of each fetus. If both are normal, then the discordancy is of little or no significance.(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues#H139239921\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Twin pregnancy: Prenatal issues&quot;, section on 'Evaluation of fetal growth and growth discordance'</a>.)</p><p>Using a lower threshold to define FGR may help distinguish the small fetus at increased risk of adverse outcome from the small fetus at low risk. As discussed above, FGR has been defined as &lt;10<sup>th</sup> percentile weight for gestational age, even though most fetuses with weights between the 5<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> percentiles are constitutionally small and have normal neonatal outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Use of a lower threshold for defining pathologic FGR is supported by findings of a large, prospective observational trial (PORTO) that included over 1100 pregnancies with nonanomalous fetuses with estimated fetal weight &lt;10<sup>th</sup> percentile on ultrasound examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Only 2 percent of fetuses at the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> percentile <span class=\"nowrap\">(5/254)</span> experienced adverse perinatal outcome, while 6.2 percent of those &lt;3<sup>rd</sup> percentile <span class=\"nowrap\">(51/826)</span> had an adverse outcome and all eight mortalities were in this group. The combination of estimated fetal weight &lt;3<sup>rd</sup> percentile and abnormal umbilical artery Doppler was a strong and consistent predictor of adverse outcome: 16.7 percent of these fetuses developed intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, sepsis, or death. Abnormal Doppler in this study included both pulsatility index &gt;95<sup>th</sup> centile and absent or reversed end-diastolic flow. An abnormal growth trajectory over time was another factor that predicted perinatal complications (eg, preterm birth, preeclampsia, neonatal morbidity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In another study, composite fetal morbidity at &lt;5<sup>th</sup> percentile versus the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> percentile was 39 and 13 percent, respectively (odds ratio 2.41, 95% CI 1.5-3.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2278906221\"><span class=\"h3\">Customized growth curves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Customized growth curves account for nonpathological maternal factors that affect birth weight. This allows interpretation of estimated fetal weight in the context of the individual fetus' growth potential, rather than against a population-based birthweight distribution. Estimated fetal weight is plotted on a customized growth curve that reflects the specific fetus' growth potential based on the mother's height, prepregnancy weight, parity, and ethnicity, all strong contributors to birth weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. This approach may more reliably distinguish those fetuses who are truly growth restricted and at increased risk of morbidity and mortality from those who are small but normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, routine clinical use of customized growth curves remains controversial as clear evidence of benefit has not been demonstrated. The author does not use customized growth curves, but does take maternal characteristics into account when assessing whether the fetus' size and growth are normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal growth restriction: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Customized growth curves'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10977009\"><span class=\"h2\">Determining the cause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genetically predetermined growth potential of the fetus can be impaired as a result of maternal, placental, or fetal processes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F99966\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99966 \">table 1</a>). To determine the cause of FGR, a complete history and physical examination is performed to assess for maternal disorders that have been associated with restricted fetal growth. In addition, obstetrical imaging and laboratory evaluations are performed to look for fetal and placental etiologies. However, the reason(s) for growth impairment cannot always be determined antenatally.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fetal survey </strong>&ndash; A detailed fetal anatomic survey should be performed in all cases since approximately 10 percent of FGR is accompanied by congenital anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and 20 to 60 percent of malformed infants are small for gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

If cell-free DNA testing is positive for trisomy 18 in this specific setting, the author does not believe amniocentesis is essential to confirm the diagnosis. He counsels the patient regarding false positives and negatives and will perform amniocentesis for confirmation if the patient chooses this approach. In a 2016 meta-analysis, the positive predictive value of cell-free DNA for trisomy 18 in a general obstetric population and a high-risk population was 37 and 84 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and would be higher when associated with ultrasound findings characteristic of the syndrome. However, if a karyotype has not been obtained, it should be obtained for confirmation after delivery (or termination) to determine whether the trisomy was the result of a parental balanced translocation, as this will impact the recurrence risk in future pregnancies. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If cell-free DNA is negative for trisomy 18, the author performs genetic amniocentesis to obtain amniocytes for microarray analysis; microarray has a significantly higher diagnostic yield than conventional karyotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The author uses the same approach if ultrasound examination reveals abnormalities for which detailed genetic analysis is indicated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In most clinical settings, the combination of positive cell-free DNA results and ultrasound findings do not provide sufficient diagnostic certainty to allow omission of fetal <span class=\"nowrap\">karyotype/microarray</span> by genetic amniocentesis if pregnancy termination is planned because of suspected aneuploidy alone. In addition, a negative cell-free DNA test does not exclude the possibility of a pathogenic chromosome abnormality not targeted by the test but associated with FGR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sonographic findings associated with fetal aneuploidy&quot;, section on 'Trisomy 13'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-chromosomal-microarray-in-obstetrics#H18811338\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of chromosomal microarray in obstetrics&quot;, section on 'Benefits'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although the finding of symmetrical FGR prior to 24 weeks of gestation is associated with a high risk of aneuploidy, this is no longer the case later in gestation. After 24 weeks, the author does not screen for fetal genetic abnormalities if anatomy is normal and FGR is asymmetric since the yield would be low, the etiology is most likely a maternal or placental disorder, and pregnancy termination is generally not an option. In a systematic review of 14 observational cohort studies including 874 apparently isolated FGR cases, the mean rate of chromosome anomalies was 6.4 percent (range 0 to 26 percent), and no abnormal karyotypes were found in the two studies of apparently isolated FGR diagnosed in the third trimester (32 pregnancies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Confined placental mosaicism is detected after delivery in approximately 10 percent of placentas associated with otherwise idiopathic FGR. We do not perform chorionic villus sampling in the second or third trimester to identify this abnormality antepartum because antenatal diagnosis would not change pregnancy management and the procedure is associated with a small risk of pregnancy complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chorionic-villus-sampling#H368306502\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chorionic villus sampling&quot;, section on 'Confined placental mosaicism'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Work-up for infection </strong>&ndash; When infection is suspected clinically because of maternal history, physical examination or fetal ultrasound findings, maternal serum should be examined for seropositivity (and evidence of acute infection if positive). Infections associated with FGR include cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, rubella, and varicella. Amniotic fluid DNA testing can also be performed for specific infections, when indicated by the clinical setting. Sonographic markers for fetal infection are often nonspecific, but include echogenicity and calcification of the brain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> liver, and hydrops. (Refer to individual topic reviews on fetal infections during pregnancy).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Malaria in pregnancy can also cause FGR and is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of malaria in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Assessment for inherited thrombophilic disorders is not recommended, as evidence for an association between the inherited thrombophilias and FGR is weak (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy#H7898294\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inherited thrombophilias in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Fetal growth restriction'</a>). However, antiphospholipid syndrome, an acquired thrombophilia, is clearly associated with FGR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women#H4025881825\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of antiphospholipid syndrome in pregnant and postpartum women&quot;, section on 'Adverse pregnancy outcome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following discussion applies to pregnancy management of FGR in structurally and chromosomally normal fetuses. Most of these cases are caused by uteroplacental insufficiency. Management of FGR associated with congenital or chromosomal anomalies depends on the specific abnormality, and is beyond the scope of this review.</p><p>The optimal management of the pregnancy with suspected growth restriction related to uteroplacental insufficiency has not been established; there is very limited evidence from randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Serial ultrasound evaluation of (1) fetal growth, (2) fetal behavior (biophysical profile [BPP]), and (3) impedance to blood flow in fetal arterial and venous vessels (Doppler velocimetry) represent the key elements of fetal assessment and guide pregnancy management decisions. The purpose is to identify those fetuses that are at highest risk of in utero demise and neonatal morbidity who may benefit from preterm delivery. </p><p>The temporal sequence of biophysical and Doppler changes in the peripheral and central circulatory systems of the growth restricted fetus are summarized below and in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73075\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73075 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-19</a>]. Progression through the entire sequence does not always occur before delivery; Doppler abnormalities in some growth restricted fetuses progress slowly or not at all or along a different pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The sequence is most likely to progress when FGR and Doppler abnormalities are identified in the second trimester and the Doppler indices worsen within the first two weeks of Doppler monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>The general sequence of Doppler and biophysical changes in FGR is: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reduction in umbilical venous flow is the initial hemodynamic change. Venous flow is redistributed away from the fetal liver and towards the heart. Liver size decreases, causing a lag in fetal abdominal circumference, which is the first biometric sign of fetal growth restriction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Umbilical artery Doppler index increases (diminished end diastolic flow) due to increased resistance in the placental vasculature.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Middle cerebral artery Doppler index decreases (increased end diastolic flow), resulting in preferential perfusion of the brain (brain-sparing effect).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing placental vascular resistance results in absent and then reversed end diastolic flow in the umbilical artery. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Middle cerebral artery Doppler index normalizes or abnormally increases as diastolic flow falls due to loss of brain-sparing hemodynamic changes. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As cardiac performance deteriorates due to chronic hypoxia and nutritional deprivation, absent or reversed end diastolic flow in the ductus venosus and pulsatile umbilical venous flow may develop. These can be preterminal events.</p><p/><p>Near the end of this sequence, biophysical changes usually become apparent: The nonstress test becomes nonreactive, the BPP score falls, and late decelerations accompany contractions. However, the cardiovascular (Doppler) and behavioral (BPP) manifestations of fetal deterioration in FGR fetuses can occur largely independent of each other, resulting in discordant Doppler and BPP findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471319068\"><span class=\"h2\">Ambulatory monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with pregnancies complicated by FGR may maintain normal activities and are usually monitored as outpatients. There are no data on which to base indications for hospitalization. We and other experts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] consider hospitalization for selected women who need daily or more frequent maternal or fetal assessment (eg, daily BPP score because of reversed diastolic flow). Hospitalization provides convenient access for daily fetal testing and allows prompt evaluation and intervention in the event of decreased fetal activity or other complications, but there is no evidence that hospitalization or bed rest improves fetal growth or outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Decisions about ambulatory versus in-hospital care should be made on a case-by-case basis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal weight assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal weight estimates are calculated using various published equations and formulae. The computed weight is then plotted on a population-based or customized growth curve, which allows the clinician to determine when the estimated fetal weight (EFW) is below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56847\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56847 \">table 2</a>) and to monitor growth velocity. Persistent growth deficiency in multiple examinations over many weeks strengthens the likelihood of FGR. Conversely, normal growth velocity in a small fetus suggests a constitutionally small but normal fetus. </p><p>Serial sonograms are obtained at two- to four-week intervals to ascertain the growth velocity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]; the longer end of this range is appropriate for the fetus with mild FGR (eg, EFW near the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile, normal amniotic fluid volume, normal Doppler findings), with a shorter interval for the fetus with features of moderate or severe disease (eg, EFW &le;5<sup>th</sup> percentile, oligohydramnios, abnormal Doppler findings).

The value of these tests is based primarily on two lines of evidence: (1) observational studies that reported lower rates of fetal death in pregnancies that underwent fetal testing than among historic controls with the same indication for testing but no fetal testing and (2) the same or lower rates of fetal death in tested pregnancies (primarily high risk) than in a contemporary untested general obstetrical population (primarily low risk). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonstress-test-and-contraction-stress-test\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonstress test and contraction stress test&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-fetal-biophysical-profile\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The fetal biophysical profile&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We prefer the BPP as it evaluates both acute and chronic fetal physiologic parameters, is relatively easy to perform, and fetal death within one week of a normal test score is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. If the nonstress test is used, amniotic fluid volume assessment should also be performed weekly. Chronic placental insufficiency results in both FGR and oligohydramnios and observational studies have reported that pregnancies complicated by FGR and oligohydramnios have a modestly increased risk of perinatal mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Conversely, normal amniotic fluid volume is infrequently associated with either FGR or fetal demise, unless the cause is a congenital malformation or aneuploidy.

A 2013 systematic review of 18 trials comparing the use of Doppler with no Doppler in high-risk pregnancies showed a 29 percent reduction in perinatal deaths (odds ratio 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.98; 1.2 versus 1.7 percent; number needed to treat 203), and significantly fewer labor inductions and cesarean deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>Normal diastolic flow is infrequently associated with significant perinatal morbidity or mortality and is strong evidence of fetal well-being, thus this finding provides support for delaying delivery when it is important to achieve further fetal maturity.

When 60 to 70 percent of the villous vasculature is obliterated, umbilical artery diastolic flow is absent or reversed and fetal prognosis is poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Reversed diastolic flow is associated with poorer neonatal outcomes than absent diastolic flow.

The two-week interval is reasonable for the fetus with estimated fetal weigh &ge;5<sup>th</sup> percentile, normal growth velocity, normal amniotic fluid volume, and no maternal risk factors for placental dysfunction. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine suggests umbilical artery Doppler studies every one to two weeks initially, and if normal, the interval between examinations can be lengthened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>If umbilical artery diastolic flow is present but decreased (pulsatility index &gt;95<sup>th</sup> percentile), we perform weekly Doppler evaluation to look for progression to absent or reversed flow.

If either of these abnormal patterns is identified, delivery should be considered (see <a href=\"#H6217432\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> below). The decision to deliver in this setting is based on gestational age as long as daily nonstress or BPP testing is normal.

Flow in the venous circulation is forward and uniform in normal fetuses. Changes in the venous circulation in the growth restricted fetus, including absent or reversed flow in the ductus venosus (absent or reversed a wave) or pulsatile umbilical venous flow, are late findings, generally occurring about two weeks after changes are observed in the arterial circulation. With progressively increasing umbilical arterial resistance, fetal cardiac performance can become impaired and central venous pressure increases, resulting in reduced diastolic flow in the ductus venosus and other large veins. Vasodilatation of the ductus venosus further diverts nutrient and oxygen rich blood to the heart but enhances retrograde transmission of atrial pressure. The ductus venosus resistance index increases, ultimately with loss of the a wave. An absent or reversed ductus venous a-wave indicates cardiovascular instability and can be a sign of impending acidemia and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

Each day of this Doppler abnormality doubles the odds of stillbirth, and fetal survival for more than one week is unlikely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>Although the use of venous Doppler interrogation remains largely investigational [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>], an increasing number of maternal-fetal medicine specialists, including the author, are using this tool to avoid very preterm delivery in fetuses with absent or reversed end-diastolic arterial flow in the umbilical artery and reassuring antepartum fetal testing (nonstress test, BPP). In these pregnancies, the absence of abnormal flow patterns in the ductus venosus has been used to support the decision to extend the pregnancy to 32 to 34 weeks, if the nonstress test and BPP remain reassuring. As noted below (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Timing delivery'</a> below), the Trial of Umbilical and Fetal Flow in Europe (TRUFFLE) demonstrated no immediate neonatal benefit from delaying delivery until ductus venosus monitoring showed significant abnormalities (absent or reversed flow), and only a possible marginal benefit in neurodevelopment at two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471321303\"><span class=\"h3\">Middle cerebral artery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doppler interrogation of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) also provides information about the hemodynamic status of the fetus.

The purpose is to identify those fetuses that are at highest risk of in utero demise and neonatal morbidity and thus may benefit from preterm delivery. The frequency is based upon the severity of findings and whether the examinations are being done to monitor fetal well-being (one to seven times per week) or fetal growth (every two to four weeks).

Delivery prompted by abnormal Doppler ultrasonography reduces the frequency of perinatal death. Normal Doppler findings are reassuring and thus potentially allow prolongation of pregnancy and reduction in the number of unnecessary preterm deliveries.
