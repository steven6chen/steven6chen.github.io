Because the thoracic cage of a child is more elastic and flexible than that of an adult, less of the force of impact is absorbed by the chest wall and proportionally more force is transmitted to intrathoracic organs. Intrathoracic injury (such as pulmonary contusion) often occurs without visible damage to the chest wall.</p><p>This topic will review the epidemiology, injury types, evaluation, and management of chest wall injuries in children. Included in chest wall injuries are rib fractures, flail chest, and sternal and scapular fractures. Thoracic trauma, intrathoracic injuries, and pulmonary contusion in children, as well as thoracic trauma and rib fractures in adults, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-stabilization-of-children-with-thoracic-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and stabilization of children with thoracic trauma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intrathoracic-injuries-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intrathoracic injuries in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-contusion-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary contusion in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-rib-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of rib fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chest wall injuries in children typically occur as the result of blunt thoracic trauma. Rib fractures constitute the vast majority of these injuries. In a prospective series describing 80 children with thoracic injuries following blunt torso trauma, 28 had rib fractures, and one had a fractured sternum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Rib fractures'</a> below.)</p><p>In reports describing children with thoracic injuries evaluated in pediatric trauma centers, most patients were injured as passengers or pedestrians in motor vehicle crashes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Among infants and young children, however, rib fractures occur most commonly as the result of inflicted injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orthopedic aspects of child abuse&quot;, section on 'Rib fractures'</a>.)</p><p>Mortality for children with chest wall injuries is usually the result of associated injuries, particularly head injury. In several retrospective series describing children with thoracic trauma, 4 to 14 percent of deaths occurred because of thoracic injuries alone. Mortality rates for children with chest and head injuries ranged from 28 to 37 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>]. The presence and number of rib fractures is positively correlated with mortality. As an example, in one observational study of over 19,000 children with rib fractures, mortality increased from 2 percent for no rib fractures to 6 percent for one fracture and 8 percent for seven fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The presence of any rib fracture compared to no fracture remained strongly associated with increased mortality even after adjustment for injury severity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anatomic structures that comprise the chest wall include ribs, costal cartilages, sternum, clavicles, and intercostal muscles. Neurovascular bundles (comprised of an intercostal nerve, artery, and vein) run along the inferior margin of each rib and may be damaged when a rib is fractured. The pectoralis muscles contribute to the support of the anterior chest wall, while the scapula provides additional protection to the superior posterior chest. Functionally, the chest wall is an essential part of the mechanics of respiration and provides protection for intrathoracic organs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Anatomy and mechanism'</a>.)</p><p>Anatomic differences in the chest walls of children, as compared with adults, influence mechanisms of injury.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased cartilage content and incomplete ossification of the ribs make the thoracic cage of a child more compliant than that of an adult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Consequently, significant force is usually required to produce chest wall injuries in children. This was illustrated in one observational series describing children admitted to a pediatric trauma center with thoracic trauma in which those with multiple rib fractures were more severely injured than those without rib fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because the chest wall of a child is more compliant, more kinetic energy can be transmitted to the intrathoracic structures without bony injury. For this reason, pulmonary contusion without rib fracture occurs more often in children than adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-contusion-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary contusion in children&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INJURY TYPES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Rib fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rib fractures comprise the most common chest wall injury among children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In observational series from pediatric trauma centers, rib fractures were identified in over 30 percent of children evaluated for blunt thoracic trauma. A rib fracture occurring in isolation is uncommon (6 percent in one study) and should prompt a thorough evaluation for associated injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Rib fracture may occur as the result of a direct blow to the rib or from compression of the chest in an anterior-posterior direction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With a direct blow, the rib may fracture inward and puncture the pleural cavity, causing a pneumothorax. Hemothorax can develop when the fractured rib lacerates an intercostal artery, an internal mammary artery, or the lung parenchyma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compression of the chest wall can cause the lateral portions of the ribs to fracture outward. Intrathoracic injury is seen less commonly with this mechanism.</p><p/><p>Rib fractures may be characterized as upper zone (ribs 1 to 4), midzone (ribs 5 to 8), and lower zone (ribs 9 to 12) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">First rib fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the upper ribs (one through three) are protected by the scapula, humerus, and clavicle (along with their muscular attachments), a significant amount of force is required to fracture these ribs. Consequently, sternal and scapular fractures as well as serious injuries such as pulmonary contusion and injury to intrathoracic vessels or cervical spine are associated with fractures of the first and second ribs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. In one series describing six children with first rib fractures, two patients had associated vascular (subclavian artery) injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Lower rib fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injury to abdominal organs can occur with lower rib fractures. This was demonstrated in a retrospective review describing adults and children hospitalized with rib fractures in which right and left lower rib fractures were associated with liver and spleen injuries, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of blunt abdominal trauma in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Flail chest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A flail chest occurs when the chest wall loses stability as the result of multiple rib fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79746\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79746 \">figure 1</a>). The mechanism usually is direct impact or crush injury. It is an uncommon injury among children as indicated in the following reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one retrospective study from a large trauma registry describing 262 patients with flail chest, 2 percent were between 0 and 14 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In two large retrospective series describing chest injuries in children, 1 percent of patients had flail chest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/4,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,17</a>].</p><p/><p>A flail segment can occur in different locations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior &ndash; Fracture of the sternum and multiple costochondral junctions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior &ndash; Midaxillary fracture with fracture or dislocation of rib heads</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lateral &ndash; Row of rib fractures both anteriorly and posteriorly</p><p/><p>Patients with flail chest can develop respiratory compromise because the flail segment responds to changes in intrathoracic pressure rather than to the pull of respiratory muscles (retracting with inspiration and bulging with expiration) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79746\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79746 \">figure 1</a>). Ventilatory disturbances develop because of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paradoxical movement of the chest wall results in inefficient expansion of the thorax, causing a significant increase in energy expenditure for breathing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain from fractures causes hypoventilation, resulting in atelectasis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with flail chest often have pulmonary contusions that cause shunting and ventilation-perfusion mismatch. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-contusion-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary contusion in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>As with other types of chest wall injury, mortality from flail chest is typically related to associated injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Clavicle fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Posterior dislocation or displaced fracture of the medial clavicle can be associated with injury to intrathoracic structures such as great vessels and the esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The medial physis of the clavicle does not typically close until 23 to 25 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Consequently, these uncommon injuries to the medial clavicle are typically physeal fractures, rather than dislocations. They are usually caused by a fall onto the shoulder rather than thoracic trauma.</p><p>Clinical features that have been reported in association with posterior displacement of the medial clavicle include dysphagia, dyspnea, hoarseness, and signs of vascular injury. In one retrospective series describing 13 children with posterior sternoclavicular fracture dislocations, mechanisms of injury included sports (11 patients), play (1 patient), and motor vehicle crash (1 patient) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Three children had dysphagia at initial presentation. One child had brachiocephalic compression noted on imaging, without associated physical findings.

Although they may be associated with significant mechanisms (such as motor vehicle crashes), observational series have described children with isolated sternal fractures that occurred as the result of direct blows or flexion compression of the spine without associated intrathoracic injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Sternal fractures have been reported as the result of inflicted injuries but do not appear to be specific for abusive mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Blunt cardiac injury occurs uncommonly in association with sternal fractures. This was demonstrated in two retrospective reviews describing 70 adult patients with sternal fractures in which one patient had a cardiac injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Scapular fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scapular fractures are uncommon among children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Anatomic position, chest wall compliance, and surrounding muscle protect the scapula from injury. As a result, significant force is usually required to produce a scapular fracture.</p><p>In several retrospective reviews describing adolescent and adult patients with scapular fractures as the result of blunt trauma, those with scapular fractures were more likely than those without scapular fractures to have serious associated injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. The following injuries were noted in these reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rib fracture &ndash; 48 to 53 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary contusion &ndash; 15 to 44 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head injury &ndash; 24 to 61 percent</p><p/><p>Injury to the axillary artery or brachial plexus may occur in association with a scapular fracture because these structures are in close proximity to the ventral surface of the scapula. In one of the reports noted above, brachial plexus injury occurred in 5 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among children, chest wall injuries typically occur as the result of forceful mechanisms such as motor vehicle crashes. Consequently, many patients may have life-threatening <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serious associated injuries that must be quickly identified and stabilized (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above). A primary survey should rapidly identify airway compromise, the possibility of a cervical spine injury, respiratory failure, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shock. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Primary survey'</a>.)</p><p>For those children who do not have obvious multisystem injuries, historical features, physical examination, and selected diagnostic studies typically identify those with significant chest wall <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> associated injuries such as flail chest, pulmonary contusion, or abdominal organ injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detailed description of the mechanism may identify those children likely to have significant injuries.

Vital signs, including respiratory rate and pulse oximetry, may indicate respiratory compromise. Patients with altered awareness or agitation may be hypoxemic or hypoperfused. Children with asymmetric pulses may have intrathoracic vessel injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The following specific features of the examination should be noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal chest wall movement (as may occur with splinting from pain or with a flail segment)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ecchymosis, abrasions, or deformity of the chest wall</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal tenderness to palpation over ribs, sternum, or scapula</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subcutaneous air</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal breath sounds</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muffled heart tones or a new murmur</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal upper extremity pulses or sensation</p><p/><p>Muscle splinting or the use of positive pressure ventilation may conceal the paradoxic motion of a flail segment, delaying diagnosis of a flail chest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ancillary studies (such as blood gas measurements or computed tomography of the head, abdomen, or chest) may be required to identify and treat associated injuries.

These injuries can generally be diagnosed with plain radiography, though computed tomography has a better sensitivity in identifying these potentially life threatening injuries. Rib views are not routinely recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, for inflicted injuries, the addition of oblique views may improve identification of rib fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Specific views are also required to identify fractures of the scapula and sternum.</p><p>In most children, physical examination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> plain radiographs are sufficient to identify rib fractures. However, in patients with clinical findings suggestive of rib fracture, ultrasonography can detect fractures that may not appear on plain radiographs. As an example, ultrasound was used to diagnose a rib fracture caused by child abuse in a nine week old infant with chest wall crepitus but negative plain radiographs on skeletal survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Posterior sternoclavicular fracture dislocations may be not be apparent with plain radiography.

Symptomatic children with first rib and sternal fractures are also at risk for associated injuries to the great vessels and should be evaluated with CT.</p><p>Echocardiography to exclude blunt cardiac injury should be performed for children with sternal fractures who have ectopy, or abnormal electrocardiograms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial management of children with chest wall injuries should be directed toward stabilizing life-threatening associated injuries.

The chest wall typically remodels leaving no permanent disability. The prognosis for more severe chest wall injuries is usually related to the severity of associated injuries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest wall injuries in children are significant primarily because they often occur following forceful mechanisms that also cause serious associated injuries. Included in chest wall injuries are rib fractures, flail chest, and sternal and scapular fractures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest wall injuries in children usually occur as the result of blunt thoracic trauma, often involving a motor vehicle. Mortality is usually the result of associated injuries, particularly head injury. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The thoracic cage of a child is more compliant than that of an adult. Consequently, chest wall injuries usually occur as the result of considerable force and are more likely to be associated with intrathoracic injury. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rib fractures are the most common pediatric chest wall injury. Flail chest, sternal fractures, and scapular fractures occur infrequently. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Injury types'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial management of chest wall injuries must focus on identifying and stabilizing life-threatening associated injuries. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Initial assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain chest radiography is sufficient to identify rib fractures, although the addition of oblique views may be helpful when an inflicted injury is suspected. Children with first rib fractures, sternal fractures, and posterior sternoclavicular fracture dislocations should generally receive computed tomography of the chest to exclude associated intrathoracic vascular injuries. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with sternal fractures should receive electrocardiograms and undergo continuous rhythm monitoring acutely to identify myocardial injury or ectopy. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiogram'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with flail chests who are in respiratory distress should receive assisted ventilation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Flail chest'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with multiple rib fractures should be admitted to the hospital and warrant specific pain management. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Definitive management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children younger than two years of age with rib fractures and <strong>without</strong> a history of high force trauma warrant evaluation for possible child abuse. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Holmes JF, Sokolove PE, Brant WE, Kuppermann N.
