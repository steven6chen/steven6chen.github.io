Penicillin is an antibiotic commonly used to treat bacterial infections. There are many different penicillins, including amoxicillin, nafcillin, ampicillin, and others. The skin is pricked or injected with solutions containing penicillin and observed for a reaction. The test is considered positive if an itchy, red bump at the site of the skin test appears in 15 to 20 minutes and negative if nothing happens. Skin testing is usually done in an allergist's office or hospital. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-to-penicillin-and-related-antibiotics-beyond-the-basics#H8\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Allergy to penicillin and related antibiotics (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Penicillin allergy testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2109899545\"><span class=\"h1\">REASONS FOR PENICILLIN SKIN TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Penicillin skin testing is performed in people who have had a possible &quot;immediate-type&quot; allergic reaction to penicillin or a related antibiotic. Immediate-type reactions are allergic reactions that usually begin within a few minutes to one hour after taking the medicine. These reactions can be serious or even fatal, although most are not. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-to-penicillin-and-related-antibiotics-beyond-the-basics#H6\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Allergy to penicillin and related antibiotics (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Allergic reactions'</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms of immediate-type reactions can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin &ndash; Itching, flushing, hives (urticaria) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79242\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79242 \">picture 1</a>), swelling (angioedema)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eyes &ndash; Itching, tearing, redness, swelling of the skin around the eyes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nose and mouth &ndash; Sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, swelling of the tongue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73131\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73131 \">picture 2</a>), metallic taste</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lungs and throat &ndash; Difficulty getting air in or out, repeated coughing, chest tightness, wheezing or other sounds of labored breathing, increased mucus production, swelling or itching in the throat, hoarseness, change in voice, sensation of choking</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart and circulation &ndash; Dizziness, weakness, fainting, an irregular (or fast or slow) heart rate, low blood pressure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Digestive system &ndash; Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea (occurring suddenly soon after taking the medicine)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nervous system &ndash; Anxiety, confusion, sense of impending doom</p><p/><p>Penicillin skin testing is also performed when the history of prior reaction is not clear; for example, if the person got a rash while taking penicillin in the past, but may or may not have had an immediate-type reaction.</p><p>Penicillin skin testing tells your allergist if you make a specific type of allergic antibody that recognizes penicillin or the chemicals penicillin changes into as it is broken down by the body. The antibody is called &quot;immunoglobulin E&quot; or &quot;IgE.&quot; If IgE recognizing penicillin is present in your body, it means that there is a risk that you could have a serious immediate-type allergic reaction to penicillin or related antibiotics if you take them again in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2109899551\"><span class=\"h1\">MEANING OF A NEGATIVE PENICILLIN SKIN TEST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you had skin testing and it was negative, meaning that there was no reaction on the skin, then you are very unlikely to have the allergic antibody in your system. However, because the testing is not 100 percent reliable, most allergists take the extra step of giving a single dose of penicillin (or a related antibiotic) under medical observation. This is to make sure you do not have a reaction after actually taking the medicine. Also, other health care providers who treat you in the future are much more likely to prescribe penicillin if you can tell them that you have received (and tolerated) a dose.</p><p>If your penicillin skin test was negative, and you took a dose of penicillin under medical observation without a reaction, then it is <strong>extremely unlikely</strong> that you will have an immediate-type allergic reaction if you take penicillin in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1389306018\"><span class=\"h1\">PREDICTING FUTURE REACTIONS TO PENICILLIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Having a negative penicillin skin test does <strong>not</strong> mean that you will never react to penicillin (or related antibiotics) in the future. Skin testing only gives information about immediate-type reactions. You could still have <strong>other</strong> types of reactions, which are unrelated to immediate-type reactions (see <a href=\"#H1389306026\" class=\"local\">'Other reactions to penicillin'</a> below). There is no reliable way to predict other types of allergic reactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1389306026\"><span class=\"h2\">Other reactions to penicillin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several other types of penicillin reactions that are not caused by the immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody and cannot be predicted by a skin test. The most common is a rash. Some people seem to be more prone than others to developing mild rashes while taking antibiotics for reasons that are not understood.</p><p>Rashes from penicillin usually appear after several days of penicillin therapy. They occur about 2 percent of the time for most penicillins, but more frequently for some penicillins like amoxicillin. The rash may last for days to weeks and may or may not be itchy. This can be annoying, but is rarely dangerous. If you develop a rash during or just after a course of penicillin in the future, call your health care provider for advice about what to do. Sometimes you can treat the rash and finish the penicillin course, and sometimes it is better to stop the penicillin right away. If you can, take a picture of the rash before you treat it, because this will help providers who take care of you in the future.</p><p>There are other more serious allergic reactions that may happen despite negative penicillin skin testing. Fortunately, these are <strong>rare</strong>. Symptoms of serious reactions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flu-like symptoms (fatigue, muscle or joint aches)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling of the face or hands</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensitivity to light (eye pain when looking at bright light)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soreness or irritation of the moist linings of the eyes, mouth, vagina, or urethra (urinary tract), sometimes with blistering</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dark patches on the skin that start to blister</p><p/><p>If any of these symptoms appear when you are taking penicillin (or a related medicine), <strong>stop the medicine and call a health care provider immediately</strong>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1389305299\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=97406\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
