Over the ensuing decades, the technique of LRYGB as well as perioperative care of patients have been gradually improved and refined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Consequently, the mortality rate associated with the RYGB has decreased from 2.6 percent at the turn of the century [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] to 0.12 percent in contemporary practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>LRYGB has been established as the gold standard against which other bariatric procedures are measured. LRYGB induces more weight loss than adjustable gastric banding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and more durable weight loss than sleeve gastrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], causes lower morbidity and mortality than biliopancreatic <span class=\"nowrap\">diversion/duodenal</span> switch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and has proven efficacy that is unparalleled by newer procedures such as mini-gastric bypass, single-anastomosis duodenal switch, intragastric balloon, and vagal stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. </p><p>The indications, preoperative workup, techniques, postoperative care, and outcomes of LRYGB are discussed here.

As examples, ghrelin levels are lower and leptin levels higher after RYGB, which results in decreased hunger and increased satiety, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1949807003\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) are the same as for all accepted bariatric procedures.

Good candidates for bariatric surgery may then choose from the procedures offered by their surgeons.

These conditions are attributable to insulin resistance. Additionally, while sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and RYGB are equally effective in improving diabetes in the short term, RYGB is associated with better long-term control of diabetes and lower rates of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery#H353466713\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical outcomes following bariatric surgery&quot;, section on 'Diabetes mellitus'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with Barrett's esophagus or <span class=\"nowrap\">severe/complicated</span> gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are better candidates for RYGB than for SG.

Crohn disease, in particular, is a relative contraindication for RYGB due to the potential for strictures and leaks at the anastomoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. SG is a suitable procedure for such patients if bariatric surgery is indicated.

The remnant stomach and the duodenum will not be accessible to standard endoscopic examination after RYGB. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) should undergo preoperative EGD to rule out Barrett's esophagus or severe dysplasia, which should be addressed before bariatric surgery. For patients who are undecided about which bariatric procedure to undergo, findings of Barrett's esophagus or severe dysphasia should encourage them to choose RYGB over sleeve gastrectomy. (See <a href=\"#H1949807003\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy#H2155025956\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p/><p>However, routine EGD before RYGB is probably not necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Identification of foregut abnormalities such as esophagitis or hiatal hernia by EGD does not usually alter the timing or operative plans of bariatric surgery. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H343289276\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2217772971\"><span class=\"h2\">Premedication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most surgeons will prescribe a low-calorie liquid diet for a period of one to four weeks prior to surgery to help reduce any stiffness and size of the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A soft, mobile liver will be easier to retract, enabling better exposure of the gastroesophageal junction. </p><p>On the day of surgery, antibiotic prophylaxis should be given within one hour prior to the skin incision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65369\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65369 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>For venous thromboembolic event (VTE) prophylaxis, sequential compression devices (SCDs) should be placed on all patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The decision to add chemoprophylaxis is controversial and left to the individual surgeon's discretion. In general, high-volume surgeons with short operative times (ie, &lt;90 minutes) do not routinely use chemoprophylaxis. Others routinely use chemoprophylaxis, most commonly low-molecular-weight heparin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Chemoprophylaxis should be given well before induction of anesthesia, at which time VTE formation already begins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. There is no role for inferior vena cava (IVC) filters in bariatric patients unless there is a history of VTE despite adequate anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-operations-perioperative-morbidity-and-mortality#H56221568\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric operations: Perioperative morbidity and mortality&quot;, section on 'Venous thromboembolism'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108554381\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General endotracheal anesthesia is required for laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). Intubating obese patients can be difficult, so every precaution should be taken. A &quot;ramp&quot; that elevates the patient's torso can allow some body fat to fall away from the head and neck area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F95285\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95285 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient#H1056257126\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the obese patient&quot;, section on 'Preparation for induction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1144620898\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient should be placed supine with both arms abducted to almost 90 degrees while secured to the table with two leg straps and a footplate to prevent sliding in the steep reverse Trendelenburg position. An inflatable mat (eg, HoverMatt) can be placed underneath the patient to facilitate moving the patient after surgery. </p><p>A urinary catheter can be placed at the discretion of the surgeon depending on the expected length of the procedure. An orogastric tube should be placed to decompress the stomach so it will be easier to manipulate. The surgeon must remember to remove the orogastric tube prior to stapling across the stomach to create the gastric pouch. (See <a href=\"#H2953812422\" class=\"local\">'Formation of the gastric pouch'</a> below.)</p><p>Typically, the surgeon will stand on the patient's right side and the first assistant on the patient's left side. To perform the procedure ergonomically, the surgeon should stand on one or two step stools so that his or her shoulders are relaxed and the forearms can operate at a &gt;90&deg; angle from the upper arms. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H269824932\"><span class=\"h2\">Pneumoperitoneum and trocar placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pneumoperitoneum can be established with one of three safe methods: Veress needle, the open Hasson trocar, and the optical trocar technique. Due to extensive subcutaneous tissue present, the Hasson technique may require a large incision in obese patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-access-techniques-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery#H651891356\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal access techniques used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Peritoneal access'</a>.)</p><p>Many bariatric surgeons favor the use of a combination of the Veress needle and the optical trocar technique. First, a Veress needle is placed inferior to the left costal margin at the midclavicular line (Palmer's point). Proper needle placement is assured by a pressure reading of &lt;10 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Carbon dioxide is insufflated via the Veress needle to a pressure of 15 mmHg. The Veress needle is then removed, and an optical viewing trocar is placed through a 10- to 15-mm skin incision in the left upper quadrant. After the port is placed, the peritoneum is inspected with the laparoscope to exclude any injury caused by either the Veress needle or the optical trocar. </p><p>After pneumoperitoneum has been established, additional trocars are inserted under laparoscopic vision:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If only one assistant is available, five trocars are typically required: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The surgeon operates through two trocars in the patient's right upper quadrant. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The camera trocar is placed in the midline, 20 to 25 cm from the xiphoid and cephalad to the umbilicus. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One trocar is used for a liver retractor. That trocar is placed through a 5-mm subxiphoid incision if a Nathanson-type retractor is used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The first assistant works through a left upper quadrant trocar. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a second assistant is available, <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> will usually hold the camera. The first assistant will then use two operating trocars in the left upper quadrant to help with retraction and exposure. </p><p/><p>Since reaching the gastroesophageal (GE) junction is imperative, trocars should generally not be placed farther than 15 to 20 cm from the xiphoid, measured after abdominal insufflation. </p><p>In patients who are very large or with a lot of truncal obesity, a third trocar for the surgeon may be added in the right upper quadrant. This way, the surgeon can reach the GE junction by using the more cephalad two trocars and reach the small intestine with the two more caudad trocars. </p><p>In patients with a previous abdominoplasty or who are very short in stature, the pneumoperitoneum may not yield a large enough working space. In such patients, trocars need to be placed further apart to avoid having instruments interfere with one another. Additional trocars may also be needed for retraction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1803727363\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical steps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basic tenets of an LRYGB are to create a 30-mL gastric pouch from the proximal stomach, anastomose it to a Roux limb that is 75 to 150 cm in length, and connect the Roux limb to the biliopancreatic (BP) limb to create a common channel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52350\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52350 \">figure 2</a>). It is generally accepted that the common channel (from the jejunojejunal [JJ] anastomosis to the cecum) must be &gt;200 cm to permit sufficient absorption of nutrients to prevent malnutrition. (See <a href=\"#H2308586384\" class=\"local\">'Bypass length'</a> below.)</p><p>These tenets can be achieved in many different ways, each with its own merits and perils. The description below is the author's preferred technique of a retrocolic, antegastric Roux limb with a linear-stapled gastrojejunal (GJ) anastomosis. Other variations in techniques will be addressed in a subsequent section. (See <a href=\"#H1842585056\" class=\"local\">'Variations in technique'</a> below.). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1926296515\"><span class=\"h3\">Division of the falciform ligament</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This is done to improve visualization of the upper abdomen and to allow easy passage of the right upper quadrant instruments to the GE junction. Also at this time, any adhesions to the anterior abdominal wall should be divided to allow full mobilization of the small intestine, omentum, and transverse colon. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3850125075\"><span class=\"h3\">Making the retrocolic passageway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The next step is to gain entry into the lesser sac via the gastrocolic omentum. The stomach is retracted superiorly, and the omentum is retracted inferiorly. The gastrocolic omentum is then opened using an electrosurgical device. After the lesser sac is entered, the transverse mesocolon is identified and an opening is made using the electrosurgical device. This opening allows access to the infracolic portion of the abdomen from the lesser sac. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7792827\"><span class=\"h3\">Formation of the jejunojejunal (JJ) anastomosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By retracting the omentum and the transverse colon cephalad, the ligament of Treitz can be seen at the left corner of the base of the transverse mesocolon where the duodenum exits the retroperitoneal space. From the ligament of Treitz, 40 to 50 cm of jejunum is measured. At this point, the jejunum is divided using a 60-mm endoscopic linear stapler. The jejunum proximal to this division becomes the BP limb, and the jejunum distal to this division becomes the Roux limb (also referred to as the alimentary limb). The BP limb is labeled with a clip or a stitch to help identify it and prevent the Roux limb from being anastomosed to itself, also known as a Roux-en-O loop. The mesentery is further divided using a 45-mm endoscopic linear stapler to allow further mobilization of the Roux limb. The mesentery should be divided perpendicular to the intestine to avoid ischemia of the Roux or BP limb. Careful attention should also be paid to avoid stapling too close to the base of the mesentery, which may cause ischemia to the entire small bowel. </p><p>An additional 75 to 150 cm of small bowel is then measured to be used as the Roux limb, the bowel at which point is placed next to the BP limb to construct a side-to-side JJ anastomosis. The bowel loops are first held together with a stay suture, which is also used to provide countertraction. Enterotomies are then made in both the BP and the Roux limbs. A 60-mm linear stapler is placed through the enterotomies and fired to create the anastomosis. The resulting common enterotomy is closed by sewing in a running over-and-over fashion or with a linear stapler. At least two antiobstruction stitches are placed to suture the Roux limb to the BP limb just proximal to the JJ anastomosis. The Roux limb is then placed into the lesser sac through the opening in the transverse mesocolon without twisting. </p><p>The transverse colon and omentum are then retracted caudally so that the Roux limb can be seen in the lesser sac. The Roux limb is then brought to the GE junction for the gastrojejunal (GJ) anastomosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2953812422\"><span class=\"h3\">Formation of the gastric pouch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is placed in a moderate to steep reverse Trendelenburg position. A 30-mL pouch has a dimension of approximately 3 x 3 x 3 cm. This can be measured using laparoscopic instruments, rulers placed in the abdomen, or a 30-mL balloon deployed in the proximal stomach as a guide. </p><p>When creating the pouch, some surgeons spare the perigastric neurovascular bundle containing vagal fibers, while others divide it routinely. In theory, sparing the vagal nerve fibers may allow better peristalsis of the BP limb and normal emptying of both the gastric remnant and the gallbladder. Normal gallbladder emptying may help prevent gallstone formation. Dividing the vagal fibers may help prevent peptic ulcer disease in the gastric remnant and the duodenum, both difficult areas to survey after RYGB. A single-institution, retrospective study of 773 patients suggested that transecting the perigastric neurovascular bundle was associated with more leaks, bleeding, and abscess formation but no difference in weight loss or diabetes control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Ultimately, whether to preserve or sacrifice the vagus nerve fibers is determined by the surgeon. </p><p>After entering the retrogastric space, the surgeon should fully mobilize the angle of His by dividing the cardia's attachments to the overlying diaphragm. Complete mobilization of the fundus, especially a large one, will ensure that the gastric pouch is not created too large.</p><p>The stomach is then divided into a gastric pouch and a gastric remnant using a stapling device after the anesthesia provider has removed all tubes and probes from the patient's mouth. Failure to do so would risk dividing the tubes or probes and leaving the distal ends in the gastric remnant. </p><p>After making the gastric pouch, the surgeon may divide more retrogastric attachments to decrease the tension on the anastomosis and to clean off the gastric tissue. Overly aggressive mobilization, however, could devascularize the gastric pouch and lead to complications such as leak or stenosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2976401797\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastrojejunal (GJ) anastomosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We prefer to create the GJ anastomosis with the linear-stapled technique, which involves the use of a linear stapler device and some hand-sewing. The anastomosis is created in two layers. </p><p>First, a posterior row of sutures is placed to connect the Roux limb to the gastric pouch. Next, enterotomies are made in both the Roux limb and the gastric pouch. Then, approximately 20 to 25 mm of a 45-mm linear stapler are placed in the enterotomies and the stapler is fired, creating the inner layer of the anastomosis. The common enterotomy is then closed by hand-sewing with sutures. At this point, some surgeons will place a bougie or endoscope through the anastomosis to calibrate the anastomosis and prevent it from being too narrow. After that, an anterior row of sutures is placed to complete the anastomosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3172818154\"><span class=\"h3\">Intraoperative leak test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After creating the GJ anastomosis, some surgeons perform an intraoperative leak test. Methods of such testing are described separately. (See <a href=\"#H2436691684\" class=\"local\">'Leak testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3860981325\"><span class=\"h3\">Closing of potential internal hernia sites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the GJ anastomosis has been created and tested, potential internal hernia sites should be closed before the procedure is terminated. For a retrocolic Roux limb, there are three potential hernia sites (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60840\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60840 \">figure 3</a>): between the Roux limb mesentery and the transverse mesocolon (ie, Petersen defect), the opening in the transverse mesocolon, and the mesentery of the JJ anastomosis. All should be closed with permanent sutures. The Petersen defect and the mesenteric defect at the JJ anastomosis should be closed with pursestring sutures; closure by running or interrupted linear sutures may reopen after significant weight loss. At the transverse mesocolic defect, the mesocolon is sutured to the Roux limb in several areas. </p><p>For antecolic Roux limbs, there are two potential internal hernia sites: the JJ anastomosis mesenteric defect and the space between the Roux limb and the transverse mesocolon. The JJ anastomosis defect should be closed with a pursestring suture. Some surgeons argue that the other defect is a large space and that while internal herniation may occur, an obstruction is less likely. Others have reported this space to be a potential site for incarceration and argued that it should be closed with a running suture or several interrupted ones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2327783401\"><span class=\"h3\">Drain placement and closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A Jackson-Pratt (JP) or Blake drain is placed near the GJ anastomosis and exits through the left upper quadrant port site where it is sutured in place. The drain can identify a leak and potentially help control a small leak. The pneumoperitoneum is evacuated actively. Trocar incisions that are greater than 10 mm should be closed at the fascia level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Because of the large amount of subcutaneous tissue in obese patients, a transfascial suturing device can be used. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1842585056\"><span class=\"h1\">VARIATIONS IN TECHNIQUE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4236633397\"><span class=\"h2\">Antecolic versus retrocolic passage of the Roux limb</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the Roux limb to reach the gastroesophageal (GE) junction from the infracolic abdomen, it must pass either in front of or behind the transverse colon. For the antecolic approach, the omentum should be divided up to the transverse colon to allow the Roux limb a shorter path to reach the gastric pouch. For the retrocolic approach, a defect is made in the transverse mesocolon for the Roux limb. (See <a href=\"#H3850125075\" class=\"local\">'Making the retrocolic passageway'</a> above.)</p><p>The antecolic Roux limb is faster to create but takes a longer course, which may predispose to ischemia or leak. The retrocolic approach is more time consuming and technically challenging but takes a shorter route to the GE junction and thus has less ischemia risk. </p><p>Another potential disadvantage of the retrocolic approach is that it creates more potential internal hernia sites than the antecolic approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60840\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60840 \">figure 3</a>). In large retrospective series, the retrocolic approach was associated with more internal herniations leading to bowel obstructions than the antecolic approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. However, the difference was reduced when potential hernia sites were routinely closed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>Since there have been no randomized trials comparing the two approaches, the choice between an antecolic and a retrocolic Roux limb is left to the surgeon's discretion. Surgeons should be familiar with both techniques, however, as at times anatomy may dictate which approach should be used. As an example, in situations where the small bowel mesentery is foreshortened and the Roux limb will not reach the GE junction without tension, a retrocolic approach may be indicated. Conversely, previous adhesions in the lesser sac from ulcer disease, pancreatitis, or previous transverse colon resection may make entry into that space difficult, in which case an antecolic approach is preferable. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2308586384\"><span class=\"h2\">Bypass length</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal length of an intestinal bypass that maximizes weight loss and minimizes side effects is debated. A Roux limb of 75 to 150 cm is most commonly used, with the longer lengths reserved for super-obese patients with body mass index (BMI) &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Some surgeons advocate including the length of the biliopancreatic (BP) limb in calculating the total bypassed intestinal length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In other words, if they create a 50-cm BP limb and a 100-cm Roux limb, they will report a 150-cm bypass. A meta-analysis of large retrospective studies concluded that the optimal length of bypass is a combined Roux limb and BP limb length of 100 to 200 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>The fact that patients have variable lengths of small bowel has led some surgeons to perform laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) based on the length of the common channel, rather than that of the Roux limb. As an example, they will measure back 200 cm of the small bowel from the cecum and create the Roux limb from there. That approach, however, has not been proven superior to standard LRYGB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Super-obese patients (BMI &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> may benefit from a longer Roux limb. However, in a randomized trial of super-obese patients (BMI between 50 and 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> undergoing LRYGB, a common channel of 150 cm resulted in similar weight loss compared with a Roux limb of 150 cm (BMI reduction of 17.2 versus 17.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> but worse metabolic outcomes in some cases, including liver failure and protein-calorie malnutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1349754501\"><span class=\"h2\">Other gastrojejunal (GJ) anastomosis techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three techniques are most commonly used to construct the gastrojejunal (GJ) anastomosis in LRYGB: the linear-stapled technique, the hand-sewn technique, and the circular-stapled technique. </p><p>The <strong>linear-stapled anastomosis</strong>, which is our preferred technique, has been described in detail above (see <a href=\"#H2976401797\" class=\"local\">'Gastrojejunal (GJ) anastomosis'</a> above). Compared with the circular-stapled technique, the linear-stapled technique can be more technically challenging and the anastomosis diameter can be more varied because the surgeon, rather than the stapler, determines the size of the anastomosis. However, the linear-stapled technique does not require an experienced assistant or enlargement of one of the trocar sites. </p><p>The <strong>hand-sewn technique</strong> is similar to the linear-stapled technique, except that no stapler is used. A posterior row of sutures is first placed to approximate the gastric pouch and the Roux limb. Enterotomies of approximately 1.5 to 2 cm are then made in the gastric pouch and the Roux limb. The inner layer of the anastomosis is then hand-sewn; some surgeons prefer to use a bougie to control the size of the anastomosis during this step. Finally, the anterior row of sutures is placed. </p><p>The advantages of the hand-sewn technique are that it can be done by a single surgeon, it does not require an experienced assistant, it does not require the size of the trocars to be increased, and it can be adapted to difficult anatomic situations that preclude the use of a stapler. The disadvantages are that it is technically most challenging and that the surgeon estimates the anastomosis diameter. </p><p>The <strong>circular-stapled anastomosis</strong> uses an end-to-end-anastomosis (EEA) stapler to create the anastomosis by connecting the anvil in the gastric pouch and the stapler device in the Roux limb. </p><p>There are two ways to place the anvil into the gastric pouch. One way is by attaching the anvil to a specially designed orogastric tube and inserting both through the mouth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111476\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111476 \">figure 4</a>). After making a small hole in the gastric pouch, the orogastric tube can be pulled into the peritoneum with the anvil trailing. Once the anvil is well seated in the gastric pouch, the orogastric tube can be cut from the anvil and removed. </p><p>The second way is to place the anvil in the stomach before the gastric pouch is created. To accomplish that, a gastrotomy is made in the distal stomach. Through the gastrotomy, the anvil is introduced along with a sharp instrument, which is used to puncture through the stomach in the area of the gastric pouch. The anvil is then pulled through the opening made by the sharp instrument. The gastrotomy in the distal stomach is closed after the gastric pouch is created. </p><p>After the anvil is positioned in the gastric pouch, the circular stapler is introduced into an opening created in the Roux limb and deployed so that the integrated trocar pierces the Roux limb wall and protrudes toward the anvil. The anvil is then connected to the integrated trocar and the EEA stapler is fired, creating a circular anastomosis. Many surgeons will buttress the anastomosis with a few Lembert sutures after stapling. </p><p>The circular-stapled technique is technically easier to perform because it does not require sewing, and it assures a uniform size of anastomosis determined by the stapler. The circular-stapled technique also has several disadvantages. First, it requires enlargement of one of the laparoscopic trocar sites to &gt;2 cm in order to accommodate the circular stapler. In retrospective comparative studies, this was associated with a higher incidence of wound infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The second disadvantage is that the circular-stapled technique has been associated with a higher incidence of anastomotic stenosis, especially when a 21-mm EEA stapler is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. EEA staplers used in upper gastrointestinal surgery generally have a luminal size of 21 or 25 mm. The third disadvantage is that this technique requires an experienced assistant because the surgeon cannot operate the EEA stapler and control the anvil at the same time. (See <a href=\"#H779691379\" class=\"local\">'Stomal stenosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The three GJ anastomotic techniques have been compared in retrospective series and meta-analyses but not randomized trials. There were no differences among the techniques in terms of leak rate, bleeding rate, length of surgery, or amount of weight loss. One study demonstrated that the circular-stapled technique had the highest stenosis rate, followed by the hand-sewn technique and the linear-stapled technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>The choice of techniques is largely determined by surgeon training and preference. However, a good bariatric surgeon will be able to perform any of the techniques as situations may call for a particular technique. For the hand-sewn technique, robotic assistance may help overcome some of the technical challenges. The efficacy of robotic RYGB, however, remains unproven.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2961134890\"><span class=\"h2\">Banded gastric bypass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some surgeons have advocated placing a band (silastic ring) around the gastric pouch during the initial RYGB procedure. Although there have been no randomized trials comparing banded RYGB with standard RYGB, several prospective comparative studies have associated banded RYGB with less weight recidivism and more weight loss, especially after the first year following bariatric surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Banded RYGB, however, was also associated with more mild complications such as dysphagia as well as vomiting and severe complications such as band eroding through the stomach wall. Thus, banded RYGB has not gained universal acceptance among bariatric surgeons. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2436691684\"><span class=\"h2\">Leak testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraoperative and postoperative leak testing of the GJ anastomosis is another area of controversy among bariatric surgeons. Available data are not sufficient to recommend either the method or the timing of a leak test. Although most leaks occur after postoperative day 7, many bariatric surgeons will perform some form of leak test prior to that. </p><p>Several methods of leak test after RYGB have been described, including (see <a href=\"#H3172818154\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative leak test'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A leak test can be done with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>. If the test is done intraoperatively, the anesthesia provider carefully places an orogastric tube under the guidance of the surgeon to avoid perforating the newly formed anastomosis. When the orogastric tube is positioned in the gastric pouch, 60 mL of methylene blue mixed with saline is injected through the orogastric tube while the surgeon watches for extravasation (blue staining). Gauze pads can be placed behind the gastric pouch to detect posterior leaks. If the test is done postoperatively, the patient will swallow the same amount of methylene blue solution; a drain needs to be placed near the GJ anastomosis to detect the leak. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An endoscopic leak test is usually done intraoperatively and is also capable of identifying any intraluminal bleeding at the anastomosis. If an endoscope is used to calibrate the GJ anastomosis, it is already in position for the leak test. The distal Roux limb is occluded with either a fired stapler or a laparoscopic instrument. The GJ anastomosis is submerged under saline, and the endoscope is slowly withdrawn while insufflating air. Bubbles at the anastomosis would indicate a leak. Additionally, the endoscope is also used to check for intraluminal bleeding at the anastomosis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A barium swallow is typically done on the first postoperative day before oral feeding is started. Besides detecting leak, a swallow study can also exclude delayed emptying of the gastric pouch caused by an early anastomotic stenosis. </p><p/><p>None of the tests described above has a distinct advantage over another. Thus, the decision about leak testing rests with the surgeon. Many surgeons do not routinely perform leak tests unless there are clinical reasons. Because radiologic studies, including computed tomography (CT) scans, have a reported positive predictive value of only approximately 67 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], a negative leak test should not preclude surgical exploration in the face of strong clinical suspicion for a leak. (See <a href=\"#H3131196237\" class=\"local\">'Leak'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H126831189\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282156952\"><span class=\"h2\">Feeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) leak test is routine, it is typically performed on the first postoperative day before oral intake is started. If the test is negative for a leak or stenosis, oral intake is started with &lt;30 mL of water every hour. If water is tolerated, the patient can be advanced to a clear liquid diet at breakfast on postoperative day 2, with the rate increased to 30 mL every 15 minutes. If the clear liquid diet is tolerated, the patient is advanced to a full liquid diet for lunch on postoperative day 2. A full liquid diet contains necessary protein supplements that will enable the patient to take in 60 grams of protein daily. </p><p>Patients can be discharged home when they tolerate the full liquid diet and their pain is controlled with oral medications. After discharge, the patient is continued on a full liquid diet for two weeks or until the first postoperative visit. After that, patients can be advanced to a soft mechanical diet. Patients should be reminded to stay hydrated by drinking at least 60 oz. of water daily. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2809966125\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring and nursing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prophylaxis against venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) should continue after surgery. Specifically, patients should ambulate on the night of surgery, sequential compression devices (SCDs) should be worn, and chemoprophylaxis should be continued starting from the night after surgery. </p><p>Patients should be continuously monitored for their respiratory and cardiovascular status after surgery. In the postoperative period, early ambulation, aggressive pulmonary toilet, deep breathing exercises, and incentive spirometry should be routine. For patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), there is no contraindication to the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices even immediately after surgery. </p><p>Antibiotic prophylaxis should be continued for 24 hours. A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) should be given intravenously until the patient is tolerating oral intake. In general, PPI therapy should be continued for one to three months after surgery to prevent marginal ulcers. The patient should be provided with pain medications with the exception of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which should be avoided due to the risk of gastric ulcers. Patients should be given antiemetics to prevent nausea and vomiting as vomiting may disrupt the newly formed GJ anastomosis. If a Foley catheter has been inserted, it should be removed on postoperative day 1 unless it is needed for monitoring of volume status. Intravenous fluids should be continued until the patient is tolerating oral intake. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1597670174\"><span class=\"h2\">Supplements and discharge medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nutritional supplementation should begin as soon as oral intake is tolerated. Because of the restrictive and malabsorptive effects from the RYGB, patients will require supplementation with multivitamin (MVI), iron, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium citrate</a>. Iron supplementation should be at least 40 mg per day in the elemental form. Calcium supplementation should be in the form of calcium citrate for better absorption. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-surgery-postoperative-nutritional-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric surgery: Postoperative nutritional management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The patient's regular medications can be restarted when the patient is tolerating oral intake. Patients should schedule a follow-up appointment with their primary care provider or a bariatrician in four to six weeks after surgery to help adjust their regular medications. For the first month after surgery, all medications should be in a liquid form, a dissolvable capsule, or crushed. Medications that are sustained, slow released, or enteric coated should be avoided because they may not be absorbed adequately. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2034846434\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H416984224\"><span class=\"h2\">Weight loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Success with any bariatric procedure is first and foremost measured by weight loss. At two years, the expected weight loss from a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is approximately 70 to 75 percent of that in excess of a patient's ideal body weight. A patient's ideal body weight is not universally defined: some calculate it assuming a body mass index (BMI) of 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> while others use the formula 105 lbs + 5 lbs (inches over 5 feet in height) for women and 107 lbs + 7 lbs (inches over 5 feet in height) for men. </p><p>A bariatric procedure's durability is also important. At five years after RYGB, the sustained weight loss is approximately 60 to 70 percent of the excess weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Weight regain may be a result of both physiologic and mechanical changes. Mechanically, gastric pouch enlargement, gastrogastric fistula formation, and gastrojejunal anastomosis widening may all cause or contribute to weight regain. Physiologically, ghrelin increase or leptin decrease may predispose to weight regain in theory, although neither has been proven definitively.</p><p>In a single-center prospective observational study from the United States, 418 patients who underwent RYGB, 417 patients who sought but did not undergo surgery (most for insurance reasons), and 321 control patients with obesity were followed long-term with follow-up rates exceeding 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. At 12 years, patient who underwent surgery lost 45 kg, compared with 2.9 kg for those who sought but did not receive surgery and 0 kg for controls. Ninety-three, 70, and 40 percent of patients maintained 10, 20, and 30 percent weight loss at 12 years. The mean percentage weight loss was virtually unchanged between 6 and 12 years (28 and 26.9 percent) for those who underwent surgery, attesting to the durability of RYGB.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3937762279\"><span class=\"h2\">Diabetes mellitus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The improvement in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most significant benefits of RYGB. In the Surgical Therapy And Medications Potentially Eradicate Diabetes Efficiently (STAMPEDE) trial, 80 percent of diabetic patients maintained glucose control (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] &lt;7 percent) after RYGB compared with 0 percent of patients treated medically at three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Among those who had some improvement in their glucose control, 24 percent who underwent RYGB relapsed (indicated by elevated HbA1c) versus 80 percent treated medically. </p><p>In the 12-year follow-up study after RYGB cited above, the remission rates of T2DM after RYGB were 75 percent at 2 years, 62 percent at 6 years, and 51 percent at 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The incidence of new-onset diabetes among patients who underwent surgery was 91 to 92 percent lower than that of patients who did not undergo surgery. </p><p>Weight loss is not the only reason for better glucose control after RYGB. By mechanisms that are not fully understood, bypassing the distal stomach, duodenum, and proximal jejunum has a positive effect on glucose control via improved insulin sensitivity and decreased insulin resistance. Thus, bariatric procedures that induce both restriction and malabsorption (eg, RYGB and biliopancreatic <span class=\"nowrap\">diversion/duodenal</span> switch) have been associated with better diabetes control than purely restrictive procedures (eg, adjustable gastric banding). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3040452080\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperlipidemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the STAMPEDE trial, triglyceride levels were 46 percent lower at three years after RYGB compared with 21 percent lower in patients treated medically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

In a prospective comparative study, more patients who underwent RYGB achieved remission of OSA than those treated with lifestyle intervention (66 versus 40 percent), with most of the benefit attributed to superior weight loss (30 versus 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1727257834\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastroesophageal reflux disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is another common complication of obesity.

(See <a href=\"#H477039501\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of action'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The indications for laparoscopic RYGB are the same as for all accepted bariatric procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-operations-for-management-of-obesity-indications-and-preoperative-preparation#H2963932\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric operations for management of obesity: Indications and preoperative preparation&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RYGB may be preferred in patients with uncontrolled type II diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, metabolic syndrome, or polycystic ovarian syndrome because it treats insulin resistance better than other bariatric procedures. (See <a href=\"#H1949807003\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crohn disease is a relative contraindication for RYGB due to the potential for strictures and leaks at the anastomoses. Patients who take glucocorticoid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs chronically may be at higher risks of developing marginal ulcers after RYGB. (See <a href=\"#H1949807003\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to routine preoperative workup, patients who are symptomatic from foregut diseases should undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) before undergoing an RYGB. Patients with Barrett's esophagus or <span class=\"nowrap\">severe/complicated</span> gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are better candidates for RYGB than for sleeve gastrectomy. (See <a href=\"#H3828529965\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative workup'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At two years, the expected weight loss from an RYGB is approximately 70 to 75 percent of that in excess of a patient's ideal body weight. At five years after RYGB, the sustained weight loss is approximately 60 to 70 percent of the excess weight. RYGB also improves obesity-related medical conditions, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, and GERD, among others. (See <a href=\"#H2034846434\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 30-day mortality rate associated with LRYGB and other major bariatric procedures has decreased from 2.6 percent at the turn of the century to 0.09 to 0.12 percent in contemporary practices. Serious morbidities include anastomotic leak, stomal stenosis, marginal ulcer, gastrogastric fistula, internal hernia, and small bowel obstruction, among others. Early diagnosis and treatment of complications is paramount to good patient outcomes.
