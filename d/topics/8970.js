Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a biologically and clinically distinct variant of AML. APL was classified as AML-M3 in the older French-American-British (FAB) classification system and is currently classified as acute promyelocytic leukemia with t(15;17)(q24.1;q21.1); <em>PML-RARA</em> in the World Health Organization classification system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Registry data suggest that many patients die before reaching an experienced hematologist. Thus, those patients who enroll in prospective clinical trials may already be a selected subset. However, with modern therapy, APL is associated with the highest proportion of patients with AML who are cured of their disease. The treatment of APL is distinct from that of other types of AML and is comprised of several stages which, in total, may span one to two years of treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77537\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77537 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remission induction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consolidation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance</p><p/><p>The treatment of APL in adults will be reviewed here.

A key component of this therapy is the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=all-trans-retinoic-acid-systemic-tretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">all-trans retinoic acid</a> (ATRA), which promotes the terminal differentiation of malignant promyelocytes to mature neutrophils (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66640\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66640 \">picture 1</a>). However, ATRA must be combined with other agents since remissions induced by ATRA therapy alone are short-lived with a median duration of only about 3.5 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The largest experience has been with ATRA combined with anthracycline-based chemotherapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F51345\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51345 \">table 2</a>). Randomized trials suggest that the combination of ATRA plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arsenic-trioxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arsenic trioxide</a> (ATO) yields equivalent and perhaps superior outcomes compared with standard regimens combining ATRA with chemotherapy. The great majority of these results are derived from clinical studies in low-risk APL and intermediate-risk APL. There is still relatively limited information on the comparative value of combination treatment with ATRA plus ATO in patients with high-risk APL. In addition, there is limited availability of ATO worldwide.</p><p>Our preferred induction regimen is informed by risk stratification based on white blood cell (WBC) count at presentation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Low- or intermediate-risk APL</strong> &ndash; Initial WBC count <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;10,000/microL</span> (&le;10 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>High-risk APL</strong> &ndash; Initial WBC count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;10,000/microL</span> (&gt;10 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L)</span></p><p/><p>Selection of induction therapy is also informed by the ability of the patient to tolerate anthracycline-based therapy, and the availability of ATO:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Low- or intermediate-risk APL </strong>&ndash; For most low- or intermediate-risk patients with newly diagnosed APL, we recommend ATRA plus ATO rather than ATRA plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy.&nbsp;This preference places a high value on the lesser toxicity (eg, myelosuppression, cardiac toxicity), fewer deaths during induction therapy, fewer relapses, and reduced risk of secondary leukemia with this combination, and less value on the longer clinical experience and robustness of the clinical trials with ATRA plus chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Where ATO is not available for initial use, a standard ATRA plus anthracycline regimen is the recommended alternative for remission induction. Patients who receive induction with ATRA plus chemotherapy benefit when ATO is used for post-remission therapy. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'ATO plus ATRA'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>High-risk APL </strong>&ndash; There is less certainty regarding the preferred approach for patients with a high WBC count at presentation. International studies are underway comparing ATRA plus ATO versus ATRA plus chemotherapy in this setting. ATRA plus chemotherapy remains the recommended initial therapy for high-risk APL until more data are available regarding the early use of ATO in this small subset. When ATRA plus ATO is used for patients with high-risk APL, the WBC count often rises and raises concerns regarding hyperleukocytosis and differentiation syndrome. In clinical trials, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemtuzumab-ozogamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemtuzumab ozogamicin</a> (GO) effectively reduced the rising WBC count in these situations, but GO is not currently readily available. Cytotoxic chemotherapy with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> or an anthracycline has been used for leukocytosis in this setting, but prospective studies have not yet been reported. These agents may add toxicities and it is not clear whether substitution of these agents for GO impacts efficacy.

It is also our preferred therapy for patients, such as older adults, who are not able to tolerate anthracycline-based therapy.

An initial dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemtuzumab-ozogamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemtuzumab ozogamicin</a> (GO, 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> was offered to the 30 patients with high-risk disease (ie, total WBC count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;10,000/microL</span> at presentation).

At a median follow-up of 30 months, when compared with AIDA, ATRA plus ATO resulted in the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar rates of CR (94 versus 89 percent) and confirmed molecular negativity (91 versus 88 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar mortality at 30 days (4 versus 6 percent) and 60 days (5 versus 9 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar estimated rates of survival at four years (93 versus 89 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superior estimated EFS at four years (91 versus 70 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower cumulative rates of molecular relapse (0 versus 27 percent) and morphologic relapse (1 versus 18 percent) at four years</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An average of 7 fewer days in hospital, 5 fewer units of blood, 4 fewer units of platelets, and 10 fewer days of intravenous antibiotics</p><p/><p>These beneficial results were seen across all patient populations. These positive results were also seen in those with high-risk disease although there were only small numbers of high-risk patients in the trial. GO is not available in most of the world. Cytotoxic chemotherapy with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> or an anthracycline is often used for leukocytosis in this setting. However, these agents may add toxicities and it is not clear whether the resulting mild to moderate leukocytosis needs to be treated with a cytoreductive agent and whether substitution of these agents for GO impacts efficacy in this setting. While some groups propose the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> as prophylaxis against differentiation syndrome, it is unclear whether this results in superior outcomes when compared with protocols that treat differentiation syndrome once symptoms develop.

Headache is common; pseudotumor cerebri has been described but is rare. Nasal stuffiness, dry red skin, chapped lips, transient elevations in serum aminotransferases and bilirubin, and hypertriglyceridemia can occur, but rarely require an alteration in treatment. However, there are two serious and specific complications that can result from ATRA treatment of APL: differentiation syndrome and hyperleukocytosis. These are discussed in more detail below.

Sometimes molecular remission is attained only after completion of consolidation therapy. Premature evaluation of response may be misleading and is discouraged. A &quot;day 14&quot; bone marrow exam during induction is rarely informative and is not necessary. Blasts and promyelocytes may remain elevated in the marrow for many weeks and the RT-PCR signal of the fusion gene may remain detectable during a slow decline. Primary resistance, however, is very uncommon.</p><p>An initial impression of response to induction therapy can be obtained with a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed after approximately 30 to 35 days when patients recover their absolute neutrophil count <span class=\"nowrap\">(&gt;1000/microL)</span> and platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">(&gt;100,000/microL)</span> and become independent from red cell transfusions. An earlier evaluation, such as that generally done for other variants of AML (eg, on day 14), is not recommended since it may result in over treatment (ie, there may be delayed clearance of malignant promyelocytes from the marrow even after they have lost their proliferative potential) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Of importance, information attained in such an early evaluation generally cannot be used to determine failure of a response to induction therapy. Response definitions are presented separately.

Patients who achieve a partial response after the initial course may achieve a CR after additional therapy. Primary induction failure is rare, but those who do not eventually achieve a hematological CR should be treated with regimens for resistant disease.

The duration of ATRA therapy during induction and the specific chemotherapy used also have an impact on outcome. While there may be a low-risk population that does not require ATRA as part of their consolidation therapy, this remains to be confirmed in prospective, randomized trials. For the time being, we recommend ATRA to be included in consolidation treatment. For all patients with APL who achieve a hematologic CR with induction, we recommend two cycles of consolidation therapy with ATO followed by two cycles of additional consolidation chemotherapy with three days of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daunorubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daunorubicin</a> plus seven days of ATRA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77537\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77537 \">table 1</a>).

The goal of such studies is to decrease the treatment toxicity for those with low-risk disease while preserving their excellent outcomes and to improve outcomes among those with high-risk disease.</p><p>As an example, a prospective trial examined the use of risk-adapted therapy in 372 adults with APL in first CR after induction with ATRA plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idarubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">idarubicin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Consolidation was adjusted according to risk. Patients with low- or intermediate-risk disease were assigned fewer doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitoxantrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitoxantrone</a> during consolidation, while patients with high-risk disease had <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> added to consolidation. When compared with historical matched controls, patients with low- and intermediate-risk disease had shorter durations of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. DFS and OS rates at three years were not significantly different. Alternatively, patients with high-risk disease demonstrated a significantly lower rate of relapse at three years (11 versus 26 percent).</p><p>Another single-arm prospective trial of risk-adapted therapy included 453 adults with APL in first CR after induction with ATRA plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idarubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">idarubicin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Patients with low- or intermediate-risk disease (WBC count &lt;10,000) were assigned to consolidation with three anthracycline-based courses, while patients with high-risk disease (WBC count &gt;10,000) had cytarabine-based consolidation. When compared with historical matched controls, patients with low- and intermediate-risk disease had significantly improved DFS rates at six years (86 versus 77 percent) and a lower cumulative incidence of relapse (11 versus 20 percent), but similar rates of OS (89 versus 85 percent). Patients with high-risk disease had superior OS at six years (83 versus 61 percent), DFS (85 versus 50 percent), and a lower cumulative incidence of relapse (9 versus 50 percent).</p><p>Longer follow-up and studies of these approaches that incorporate newer agents (eg, ATO) are needed before risk-adapted therapy can be widely implemented.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Evaluating response after consolidation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the completion of consolidation, the response to treatment is again evaluated with a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. This sample should be tested for the <em>PML-RARA</em> fusion transcript using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The goal of APL treatment is the achievement of a <strong>molecular</strong> CR (CRm), as defined by the absence of the <em>PML-RARA</em> fusion transcript using RT-PCR methods with a sensitivity threshold of at least 10<sup>-3</sup> or 10<sup>-4</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

It is usually attained only after completion of consolidation therapy, although it may occur more promptly if ATO is used for consolidation. Therefore, RT-PCR need not be attempted immediately after completion of induction treatment, as this premature evaluation may give a misleading interpretation of response failure. Patients who achieve CRm should proceed directly to maintenance therapy. Patients who have a positive RT-PCR test at the conclusion of the planned consolidation sequence should have a second bone marrow aspirate and biopsy with RT-PCR testing repeated in four weeks. If this second test is negative, the patient may proceed to maintenance therapy. If the second RT-PCR is still positive, the patient should proceed to treatment for resistant disease.

As such, the role of maintenance therapy among patients who achieve a molecular complete remission (CRm) after initial therapy that incorporates ATO and ATRA is controversial and likely depends to a considerable extent on the precise induction and consolidation treatment. Although the issue remains unresolved, initial studies suggest that patients who receive ATO as part of their induction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> consolidation do not need maintenance after a CRm is achieved.

It is necessary to start treatment without delay as soon as the diagnosis is suspected based on cytologic criteria, and before definitive genetic, cytogenetic, or immunostaining confirmation of the diagnosis has been made. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Emergent pretreatment evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of APL is comprised of several stages that, in total, span one to two years of treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77537\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77537 \">table 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Remission induction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Consolidation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Maintenance</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with newly diagnosed APL, we recommend induction therapy that incorporates <a href=\"topic.htm?path=all-trans-retinoic-acid-systemic-tretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">all-trans retinoic acid</a> (ATRA) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Our preferred induction regimen depends on the white blood cell (WBC) count at the time of diagnosis, the ability of the patient to tolerate anthracycline-based chemotherapy, and the availability of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arsenic-trioxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arsenic trioxide</a> (ATO). For these purposes, patients with an initial WBC count <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;10,000/microL</span> (&le;10 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L)</span> are considered to have low- or intermediate-risk APL; all others are considered to have high-risk APL. (See <a href=\"#H357174158\" class=\"local\">'Choice of regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Low- or intermediate-risk APL </strong>&ndash; For most low- or intermediate-risk patients with newly diagnosed APL, we recommend ATRA plus ATO rather than ATRA plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Where ATO is not available for front-line use, a standard ATRA plus anthracycline regimen is the recommended alternative for remission induction. Patients who receive induction with ATRA plus chemotherapy benefit when ATO is used for post-remission therapy. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'ATO plus ATRA'</a> above and <a href=\"#H191827271\" class=\"local\">'ATRA plus chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>High-risk APL </strong>&ndash; There is uncertainty regarding the optimal approach for high-risk APL patients (ie, those with a high WBC count at presentation). ATRA plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy is the most commonly used initial therapy for this subset of patients. However, the combination of ATRA and ATO plus the early introduction of cytotoxic chemotherapy with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> or an anthracycline for a rising WBC count may be equally effective and possibly less toxic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with APL who achieve a complete remission (CR) with ATO plus ATRA, we suggest ATO-based consolidation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients who achieve a CR with ATRA plus chemotherapy<sup> </sup>induction, we recommend two cycles of consolidation therapy with ATO followed by two cycles of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daunorubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daunorubicin</a> plus ATRA rather than daunorubicin plus ATRA or daunorubicin therapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Other post-remission regimens using anthracyclines may be equally effective. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Consolidation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are limited data regarding the role of maintenance therapy following the use of ATO as part of the induction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> consolidation therapy for APL and practice varies. For patients with low- or intermediate-risk APL who achieve a molecular CR (CRm) after therapy that included ATO as part of induction or consolidation therapy, we suggest observation rather than maintenance therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients who are willing to accept the increased toxicity and cost in return for a potential yet unproven decrease in the risk of relapse may reasonable choose to receive maintenance. For all other populations, we suggest maintenance therapy rather than observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For maintenance, we suggest the use of intermittent single agent ATRA rather than the combination of intermittent ATRA, 6-mercaptopurine, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two important treatment issues that require careful attention in order to maximize survival:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Disseminated intravascular coagulation &ndash; If this complication is present, we suggest the use of transfusions of platelets and cryoprecipitate to maintain the platelet count above 30,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microL</span> or higher and the plasma fibrinogen concentration above 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). As the benefit of heparin use in this setting is not clear, we suggest that it not be used (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, the best treatment approach is the immediate initiation of treatment with ATRA followed quickly by chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Control of coagulopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Differentiation syndrome &ndash; Early recognition and aggressive management of this syndrome is paramount. If present, we recommend immediate treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (10 mg intravenously every 12 hours for three or more days), along with temporary cessation of ATRA if severe symptoms were present (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). ATRA can be restarted once the syndrome has resolved.
