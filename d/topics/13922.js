The male urethra is divided into the anterior (bulbous and pendulous) and posterior (prostatic and membranous) urethra at the level of the urogenital diaphragm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76039\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76039 \">figure 1</a>). Anterior urethral injuries may be caused by direct blows, straddle injuries, instrumentation, or penile fracture. By contrast, posterior urethral injuries usually occur in the setting of significant pelvic fractures, often caused by motor vehicle collisions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60938\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60938 \">table 1</a>). Urethral injuries are much less common in women because the female urethra is short, relatively mobile, and lacks significant attachment to the pubis. </p><p>In this topic, we will concentrate on posterior urethral injuries, including their etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic evaluation, and management. A discussion of anterior urethral injuries and other genitourinary traumas can be found in other UpToDate topics.

Blunt trauma from motor vehicle accidents or occupational injuries account for at least 90 percent of the cases, but penetrating trauma can result in these injuries as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The urethra is most often injured in fractures that disrupt the pelvic region or cause diathesis of the pubic symphysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The risk of urethral injury varies with the types of pelvic fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. High-risk injuries include concomitant fractures of all four pubic rami or fractures of both ipsilateral rami accompanied by massive posterior disruption through the sacrum, sacroiliac joint, or ilium. Low-risk injuries include single ramus fractures and ipsilateral rami fractures without posterior ring disruption. The risk of urethral injury approaches zero with isolated fractures of the acetabulum, ilium, and sacrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Posterior urethral disruption occurs when a significant pelvic fracture causes upward displacement of the bladder and prostate. Avulsion of the puboprostatic ligament is followed by stretching of the membranous urethra resulting in a partial or complete disruption at the anatomic weak point, the bulbomembranous junction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The magnitude of injury determines the length of the ultimate defect, ranging from elongation to complete transection of the urethra, with transection seen in most cases. In the least severe of cases, there may be elongation of the membranous urethra as the prostatic apex is separated from the pelvic floor, allowing the bladder base to rise up into the pelvis with a resultant hematoma. This typically results in fibrosis of the injured area and narrowing of the urethra but rarely in obstructive scar tissues. When the injury is more severe, the prostatic apex actually tears away, resulting in complete transection of the urethra and scar formation in the injured area. Thus, the resulting &quot;stricture&quot; is technically a distraction defect, with no lumen present between the urethral ends [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Most urethral injuries that occur with a pelvic fracture are distraction defects with minor separations. Very severe trauma may result in wide separation of the urethral ends along with concomitant injuries to the bladder or rectum, which may be seen in up to 18 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

RUGs should also be performed liberally in patients with injury to the penis, scrotum, and perineum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The 2016 American Urological Association Urotrauma guidelines specifically state that an RUG should be performed immediately in cases of pelvic trauma and blood at the meatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. If no extravasation is seen, a Foley catheter may be inserted and a cystogram or upper tract study taken as indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-genitourinary-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt genitourinary trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Primary evaluation and management'</a>.)</p><p>The only situation in which an RUG should be deferred is when significant pelvic vascular injury is suspected <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pelvic angiography may be indicated. This is because assessment for potentially life-threatening bleeding takes precedence and the contrast used to perform a RUG may interfere with the interpretation of a pelvic angiogram or computed tomography (CT) scan. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-genitourinary-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt genitourinary trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'History, examination, and approach to testing'</a>.)</p><p>If a patient requires drainage of the bladder urgently during the initial trauma evaluation and an RUG cannot be immediately performed, we recommend placing a suprapubic tube and completing the evaluation of the lower genitourinary tract once the patient is stabilized. Although CT is routinely used in evaluating trauma patients, it is not useful for diagnosing urethral injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45729672\"><span class=\"h2\">Retrograde urethrogram (RUG)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An RUG is the primary test used to evaluate the integrity of the urethra in patients with a suspected injury. It is fairly simple and straightforward to perform but does require planning in order to obtain a good study. A well-performed RUG is key to the accurate diagnosis and classification of urethral injuries and is imperative to assessing the extent of injury and planning surgical repair. </p><p>The RUG should be obtained with the patient positioned in a semi-oblique position, rotated approximately 30&deg;. Many injuries in the posterior urethra and proximal bulbar urethra can be missed on an anterior-posterior film. A scout film should be performed in this position to allow visualization of the entire urethra (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F114883\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114883 \">image 1</a>). To verify that the patient has been appropriately positioned, the obturator fossa should be obliterated on the scout film. The patient should be kept still to avoid potentially disrupting a stable pelvic hematoma. A 60-mL catheter-tip syringe should be filled with a mixture of 40 mL of water-soluble contrast and 10 mL of viscus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>. Attach the syringe to a sterile Christmas tree adapter, if available. </p><p>Using sterile techniques, the tip of the penis is then prepped, and a 4 x 4 sterile gauze is placed under the tip of the penis. The tip of the Christmas tree adapter is placed inside the meatus of the penis, and the glans of the penis is grasped with the nondominant hand. The adapter should be inserted snugly into the urethral meatus to ensure a tight fit as leaking contrast could result in a spurious study. The contrast solution is then injected into the penis in a retrograde fashion. If no Christmas tree adapter is available, injecting the fluid directly from the tip of a catheter-tip syringe is acceptable. Alternatively, insert a Foley catheter a few centimeters into the urethra and partially inflate the balloon to ensure a snug fit within the fossa navicularis. Attach the catheter-tip syringe to the Foley catheter and inject the contrast.</p><p>Under fluoroscopy, the penis is then bent downward in order to view the location of the suspensory ligament of the penis. Contrast is injected into the penis until it fills the entire urethra and a small amount can be seen entering into the bladder. The patient then is allowed to void in the same position showing complete emptying of the contrast from the system, thus providing a voiding phase of the RUG. If fluoroscopy is not available, plain radiographs can be used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F114884\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114884 \">image 2</a>). In that case, inject 50 to 60 mL (0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> in children) of contrast before obtaining a plain film while injecting the final 10 mL. </p><p>Contrast entering the bladder without extravasating through the urethra defines a normal RUG. A partial disruption is demonstrated by urethral extravasation accompanied by some contrast entering the bladder. A complete disruption results in urethral extravasation without any contrast entering the bladder. (See <a href=\"#H3374091739\" class=\"local\">'Grade of injury'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H675086664\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A urethral injury should be suspected in patients with penetrating or blunt trauma to the genitalia or lower abdomen, or a significant pelvic fracture, accompanied by one or more of the clinical symptoms or signs described above (eg, blood at meatus).

While the injury grades may be descriptive, they do not accurately predict the type of repairs or the number of steps required to repair an injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3640676018\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2154475714\"><span class=\"h2\">History and evolution of the repairs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic fracture urethral distraction defect repair has a long and storied history dating back to the 1950s. One of the earliest techniques in the literature, described by Badenoch, was an unsutured urethral pull-through operation, in which the proximal end of the bulbar urethra was attached to a catheter and pulled into the bladder through the defect and left to heal to the prostatic urethra by scarring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Several scrotal-based procedures brought scrotal skin through the stricture at the first stage, followed by tubularization of the skin into a neourethra at a second stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>Other authors described delayed repair techniques that utilized abdominal pubectomy to bridge the gap between the proximal urethra and the prostate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Waterhouse developed a procedure that required removing an entire wedge of the anterior pubis to allow access for the repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Turner-Warwick described an approach in which the repair was based on the complexity of injury and the type of defect, as well as factors such as the presence of pelvic abscess, fistula, or cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. When necessary, an abdominoperineal approach with a concomitant pubic bone removal was used.<sup> </sup>Although these techniques were successful, all were associated with significant morbidity and a long convalescence for the patient.</p><p>One of the most significant advances in this field was made by George Webster in 1985 and evolved over the subsequent decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. He described a surgical technique that was completely perineal, thus avoiding abdominal exposure, and through a stepwise approach was able to repair very long defects. This stepwise approach continues to be our preferred method of repairing these types of injuries. (See <a href=\"#H3261403190\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> below and <a href=\"#H827024036\" class=\"local\">'One-stage perineal anastomotic urethroplasty'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3261403190\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of posterior urethral injuries from high-velocity projectiles should consist of suprapubic drainage, and a Foley catheter if possible. If there are concomitant injuries to the distal gastrointestinal tract, a diverting colostomy may be required. Any early attempt at repair is not indicated, since it may cause a significant amount of bleeding, incontinence, and possible erectile dysfunction.</p><p>Management of a posterior urethral injury caused by blunt trauma depends upon whether there is any other significant pelvic injury. Immediate suture repair of a posterior urethral injury with evacuation of the pelvic hematoma is indicated in cases where there are concomitant bladder neck injuries, rectal injuries, or other indications for an open laparotomy. In the majority of cases, however, the definitive repair of a urethral injury should be delayed until the patient is stable enough to undergo an elective procedure. The 2016 American Urological Association guidelines for urethral stricture disease state that definitive urethral reconstruction for pelvic fracture urethral injury should be planned only after major injuries stabilize and patients can be safely positioned for urethroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>How best to manage patients with a posterior urethral injury who do not require immediate surgery is a topic of debate within the urologic community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We prefer early suprapubic drainage with delayed repair in three to six months, rather than primary realignment. Our preference for early <span class=\"nowrap\">drainage/delayed</span> repair is based on the fact that early drainage permits acute decompression of the urinary system, convalescence of the patient, and subsequent definitive reconstruction in a controlled setting. From a technical perspective, a delayed repair allows the pelvic hematoma to resolve, the prostate to descend, and the urethral defect to shorten. These factors may lower risk of complications compared with early realignment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other surgeons prefer primary realignment using endoscopic techniques, with the rationale that early realignment may spare some patients the need for further reconstruction. However, limited long-term follow-up data indicate that the majority of patients develop recurrent strictures after primary realignment that would require further interventions and thereby protract their clinical course. In one retrospective series of 129 patients who underwent endoscopic primary realignment, only 14 percent required no further treatment at a median follow-up of 45 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The remaining 86 percent developed recurrent strictures at a median of 23 months and required additional definitive procedures (most commonly perineal anastomotic urethroplasty [51 percent] and internal urethrotomy [19 percent]). An earlier meta-analysis with more variable follow-up reported a 49 percent restricture rate among a total of 142 patients treated with primary endoscopic realignment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p/><p>Regardless of the surgeon's choice for delayed versus immediate <span class=\"nowrap\">repair/realignment,</span> the current American Urological Association guidelines on Urotrauma specifically state that clinicians should establish prompt urinary drainage in patients with pelvic fracture-associated urethral injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1637838291\"><span class=\"h2\">Suprapubic tube (SPT) drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A suprapubic tube (SPT) can be placed open or percutaneously. Open SPT placement is usually performed in association with surgeries for other traumatic injuries (eg, prostate injury, bladder trauma repair, orthopedic fixation). </p><p>A percutaneous SPT is placed when a laparotomy is not required and should only be performed in a patient with a distended bladder. If the patient has a history of prior lower abdominal surgery, a percutaneous SPT should only be attempted with simultaneous cystoscopy and abdominal imaging control to ensure that there is no bowel within the potential tract of the SPT. Percutaneous SPT placement may be performed by a trained emergency room clinician, general surgeon, urologist, or interventional radiologist.</p><p>To place a percutaneous SPT, the patient should be placed supine in a steep Trendelenburg (head-down) position to allow the bowels to fall away from the dome of the bladder. If ultrasound is available, it can be used to guide placement. After injection of a local anesthetic, a puncture incision is made two to three fingerbreadths above the symphysis pubis in the midline. A finder needle can be used to estimate the depth necessary to reach the bladder dome and obtain urine. A trocar or puncture cystotomy tube is then placed into the dome of the bladder at a 45&deg; angle with the tip directed caudally. Once urine is obtained with a trochar or puncture cystotomy tube, the tube should be advanced another 1 to 2 cm to ensure that the tube is adequately within the dome of the bladder. The cystostomy tube is then advanced into the bladder through the trocar, the balloon is inflated with 10 mL of sterile water, and slight traction is applied to the tube to ensure that the dome of the bladder is well apposed to the anterior abdominal wall. The SPT is then secured to the skin with nylon sutures. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2156408634\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical options for definitive urethral reconstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical options for definitive reconstruction of a traumatic posterior urethral injury include repair and realignment. Urethral repair means to close the injury or defect directly with sutures. Urethral realignment means to stent the injury or defect with a catheter without any formal attempt at repair and to allow it to heal by scarring. Both repair and realignment can be performed open or endoscopically (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F114682\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114682 \">table 3</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3792073659\"><span class=\"h3\">Immediate open repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediate open repair involves abdominal or perineal exploration with suture repair of the urethral defect shortly after injury. This treatment option was popular in the past but has fallen out of favor because of high rates of impotence (44 percent), incontinence (20 percent), and stricture recurrence (69 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/21,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,34-36</a>]. These morbidities are often caused by injury to surrounding structures such as the neurovascular bundles during an attempt to mobilize and repair the urethra because of factors such as acute bleeding, poor visualization, and loss of viable tissue planes related to the acute injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Thus, we have abandoned any attempt at an open repair of urethral injury in the acute period, except in cases where there are concomitant bladder neck injuries, rectal injuries, or other indications for an open laparotomy. (See <a href=\"#H3261403190\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H411592485\"><span class=\"h3\">Immediate endoscopic realignment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This technique involves placing a catheter across the urethral defect in the immediate post-injury period (24 to 72 hours). It can be accomplished with a variety of techniques, including the use of magnetic guides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], interlocking sounds, or open surgical techniques. The greatest deterrents to this approach are the possible morbidities associated with an acute intervention, including erectile dysfunction, incontinence, and injuries to other structures such as the rectum. At long-term follow-up, urethral strictures recur in up to 50 to 100 percent of patients, which may necessitate additional endoscopic procedures, intermittent catheterization, or surgical reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/29,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,39</a>]. </p><p>Literature on the benefits and harms of immediate endoscopic realignment is mixed: while a 2017 meta-analysis showed that up to 50 percent of patients who underwent immediate realignment were able to avoid any further surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], other reports showed that an early realignment procedure may cause prolonged stricture recurrences relegating some patients to intermittent catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/32,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,40-42</a>]. </p><p>We feel that immediate endoscopic realignment may be an appropriate treatment if one can place a catheter across the urethral defect in the earliest time period with minimal manipulation. Excessive manipulation with infiltration of irrigant, however, should be avoided, as it may result in worsening of the injury and prolonged convalescence. The 2014 American Urological Association guidelines on Urotrauma state that clinicians may perform primary realignment in hemodynamically stable patients with pelvic fracture-associated urethral injury but should not perform prolonged attempts at endoscopic realignment in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1375817333\"><span class=\"h3\">Immediate open realignment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open realignment procedures involve the open placement of a catheter across the urethral defect as a stent using various techniques such as interlocking sounds, magnetic sounds, or the railroading technique with an antegrade and retrograde approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Compared with delayed techniques, immediate open realignment can potentially decrease the length of a distraction defect and thereby reduce the incidence and severity of stricture formation. However, the immediate open approach is associated with a risk of significant bleeding once the tamponade effect of a retropubic hematoma is released. Additionally, restricturing is seen in at least 50 percent of patients, necessitating additional procedures. While a 50 percent restricture rate may be argued as a good outcome, we feel that these patients can be better served with delayed surgical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/35,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H912897344\"><span class=\"h3\">Delayed endoscopic realignment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delayed endoscopic realignment is an option for patients who have stabilized enough to return to the operating room 5 to 10 days after injury for a separate reason, such as orthopedic instrumentation, placement of hardware, or wound care interventions. Compared with immediate realignment, delayed endoscopic alignment incurs a lower risk of massive bleeding because the pelvic hematoma tends to be more stabilized and organized. </p><p>Delayed endoscopic realignment is typically accomplished by two endoscopists, with the goal of approximating the two distracted urethral ends to facilitate early healing. The antegrade flexible endoscope enters the bladder via the suprapubic catheter tract, negotiates the bladder neck, and emerges in the injury hematoma. The retrograde endoscope (particularly if a 24-Fr resectoscope sheath is used) allows for hematoma irrigation, visualization of the defect, and antegrade passage of a linking guidewire, over which a stenting catheter can be passed across the defect. The catheter is left in place for four to six weeks. Later, a pericatheter retrograde urethrogram will precede stent removal and voiding trial.</p><p>Delayed endoscopic realignment is a simple procedure that can be performed endoscopically by most urologists. The realignment may reduce the severity and length of the stricture, thereby decreasing morbidity of a definitive repair at a later time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. There is, however, a fairly high rate of stricture recurrence, between 20 and 100 percent, which may necessitate subsequent office endoscopic manipulation or intermittent catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-49</a>]. Additionally, delayed endoscopic realignment does not seem to cause increased incidences of erectile dysfunction as do immediate open procedures. </p><p>When performing any endoscopic manipulation for urethral injuries, one must excise caution not to convert a short urethral distraction defect into a complex stricture. Unnecessary manipulation, excessive irrigation, or heroic attempts at prolonged endoscopic maneuvers may also convert a partial disruption into a complete distraction defect and worsen the injury. Thus, when facing difficulty with any endoscopic intervention, the safest strategy is to simply place a suprapubic tube and defer to a delayed urethral reconstruction at a later time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3062277324\"><span class=\"h3\">Delayed endoscopic repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delayed endoscopic repair was used in the past for pelvic fracture urethral distraction defects that were very short after a prolonged period of healing (three to six months after the injury) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>]. One technique, which requires advanced endoscopic skills, uses a rigid scope placed retrograde and a flexible scope placed antegrade to perform some version of &quot;cut to the light.&quot; Another technique places an endoscopic sharp guidewire across the defect to establish continuity, followed by resection or dilation of the stricture and placement of a catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. Although a delayed endoscopic repair may establish urethral continuity, the majority of patients still require subsequent endoscopic manipulation or intermittent catheterization. We no longer recommend delayed endoscopic repair because of a high rate of stricture recurrence and potential injury to surrounding organs such as the rectum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/57-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-60</a>]. The 2016 American Urological Association guidelines for male urethral stricture also state that surgeons should perform delayed urethroplasty instead of delayed endoscopic procedures after urethral <span class=\"nowrap\">obstruction/obliteration</span> due to pelvic fracture urethral injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2280517151\"><span class=\"h3\">Delayed open repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there is no one &quot;magic bullet&quot; in the definitive treatment of pelvic fracture urethral injuries, the placement of a suprapubic catheter acutely for urinary diversion followed by a delayed repair in three to six months has become the most widely accepted treatment option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/29,61-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,61-64</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3261403190\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p>The three- to six-month delay, during which the patient is managed with suprapubic catheter drainage, permits the orthopedic injuries to stabilize and the patient to undergo rehabilitation in preparation for another reconstructive operation. In the past, urologists were pressured into attempting early urethral realignment in order to remove the suprapubic catheter because some orthopedic surgeons felt that the presence of a suprapubic catheter may expose the fixation hardware to infection. However, the current American Urological Association guidelines on Urotrauma specifically state that surgeons may place suprapubic tubes in patients undergoing open reduction internal fixation for pelvic fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>An early <span class=\"nowrap\">drainage/delayed</span> repair strategy also allows a general urologist with little experience in treating pelvic fracture urethral injuries to acutely stabilize the patient by placing a suprapubic tube and defer the more complex reconstruction to a more experienced subspecialty surgeon after the patient has recovered from the majority of <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> orthopedic and traumatic injuries. </p><p>Before surgery, a combined retrograde urethrogram and antegrade cystography (&quot;up-and-down-o-gram&quot;) should be performed to define the length of the distraction defect and any other associated pathology (eg, bladder neck competence, fistula or bladder calculus). This is in accordance with the 2016 American Urological Association guidelines on urethral stricture, which state that clinicians should use retrograde urethrography with voiding cystourethrogram <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> retrograde and antegrade cystoscopy for preoperative planning of delayed urethroplasty after pelvic fracture urethral injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H827024036\"><span class=\"h4\">One-stage perineal anastomotic urethroplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most pelvic fracture urethral injury defects can be reconstructed with a one-stage perineal anastomotic urethroplasty. This remarkably versatile procedure can overcome long obliterative strictures by allowing the bulbar urethra to take a more direct route to the anastomosis. Consequently, only uncommon (&lt;5 percent), extremely complex strictures (eg, bladder base fistula, pelvic floor cavity, urethrorectal fistula) require an abdominoperineal approach or substitution urethroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>]. </p><p>This progressive perineal anastomotic repair technique involves mobilization of the urethra as a distally based urethral &quot;flap&quot; and transection of the urethra at the point of obliteration. The bulbar urethra is then anastomosed to the prostatomembranous urethra proximal to the obliteration after cutting down onto the tip of a descending sound passed through the suprapubic tract into the proximal urethral &quot;stump.&quot; Once perineal access to the spatulated proximal urethra has been secured, the procedure aims to achieve a tension-free bulboprostatic urethral anastomosis using the fewest steps in a stepwise fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 1: Urethral mobilization</strong> &ndash; Circumferential mobilization of the distal urethra to the suspensory ligament of the penis provides 2 to 3 cm of length, sufficient for anastomosis in 8 percent of our cases. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After a midline perineal incision is created, the bulbar urethra is circumferentially mobilized as proximally as possible. We transect the urethra at this point and then continue to mobilize distally until the suspensory ligament of the penis is reached. This turns the urethra into a flap that is based on <strong>retrograde</strong> blood flow from the dorsal penile artery and corporal perforating vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53027\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53027 \">figure 2</a>). Any previous injury or surgery to the urethra or anastomotic tension could jeopardize the viability of the flap. In those patients, a bulbar artery-sparing posterior urethroplasty may be more suitable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A urethral sound or a flexible cystoscope is then placed through the suprapubic tube tract into the proximal urethra to help identify the proximal urethral stump by palpation. Once the surgeon can locate the proximal stump in the scarred pelvic floor by feel, it can be reached by cutting down upon the urethral sound directly through the pelvic floor. It is imperative to remove all scar tissue in the vicinity of the urethra to create a tension-free mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis. Once the proximal urethra stump is dissected circumferentially, it is spatulated posteriorly, often as far proximal as the verumontanum. The distal bulbar urethra is spatulated anteriorly. In many cases, this will allow a tension-free anastomosis with radial 4-0 polyglycolic acid sutures. A nasal speculum and sutures that are bent into a J-shape and placed with a &quot;push in-pull out&quot; technique will help in the completion of this sometimes challenging anastomosis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>Corporal body separation</strong> &ndash; Separating the proximal corporal bodies shortens the distance by another 1 to 2 cm and is sufficient for anastomosis in 41 percent of our cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When step 1 does not result in a tension-free anastomosis, added length can be gained by routing the urethra between the posteriorly separated corporal bodies. The separation of the corporal bodies may be performed in a bloodless plane for up to 5 cm, which straightens the trajectory of the urethra from the tip of the penis toward the proximal defect. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 3: Inferior wedge pubectomy</strong> &ndash; An inferior wedge pubectomy can be performed by resecting a 1.5- to 2-cm wide wedge of bone from the inferior surface of the pubis. This further shortens the defect by another 1 to 2 cm, facilitating anastomosis in 28 percent of our cases. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the first two steps (urethral mobilization, corporal separation) fail to facilitate a tension-free anastomosis, the distance can be further reduced by performing a wedge excision of the inferior pubic arch from the perineum. The corporal separation will expose the interportion of the pubic bone. The dorsal vein will be exposed and ligated, which permits access to excising a small wedge of the pubic bone with an osteotome or a Capener gouge and bone rongeurs. We have found that this step often significantly increases visualization and improves exposure, thus making the anastomosis even easier to perform.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 4: Supracrural rerouting</strong> &ndash; Rerouting the urethra around the lateral surface of a corporal body provides another 1 to 2 cm of length and is needed in 23 percent of our cases. The urethra is typically routed dorsally around the lateral side of the left corporal body and through the defect created by the inferior pubectomy. This further reduces the distance to the anastomosis by providing an even more direct route from the penis to the proximal urethra. A small tunnel of the bone on the inferior pubic rami lateral to the previously performed midline inferior wedge pubectomy should be removed where the urethra runs to avoid compression between the corporal body and bone. </p><p/><p>The results of a one-stage perineal anastomotic urethroplasty are very good, with a success rate of &gt;90 percent in experienced centers. The rate of de novo erectile dysfunction is low, and if the patient has a competent bladder neck, continence is preserved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. The results are not as good in prepubertal boys, in whom this injury is fortunately uncommon. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2428072126\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior urethral injuries usually occur in the setting of significant pelvic fractures, often caused by motor vehicle collisions. The magnitude of injury determines the length of the ultimate defect, ranging from elongation to complete transection of the urethra, with transection seen in most cases. (See <a href=\"#H3560650230\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2730411522\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A urethral injury should be suspected in patients with penetrating or blunt trauma to the genitalia or lower abdomen, or a significant pelvic fracture, accompanied by one or more of clinical signs, including blood at meatus, inability to void, perineal hematoma, and high-riding prostate on digital rectal exam. Such patients should undergo a retrograde urethrogram (RUG), which is diagnostic of the urethral injury and establishes the injury grade. (See <a href=\"#H1704437403\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1672987679\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H675086664\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior urethral injuries from high-velocity projectiles should be managed with suprapubic drainage, and a Foley catheter if possible. If there are concomitant injuries to the distal gastrointestinal tract, a diverting colostomy may be required. Any early attempt at repair is not indicated, since it may cause a significant amount of bleeding, incontinence, and possible erectile dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H3261403190\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior urethral injuries caused by blunt trauma may require immediate suture repair when there are concomitant bladder neck injuries, rectal injuries, or other indications for an open laparotomy. The immediate open repair should not be performed in any other patients due to high rates of impotence, incontinence, and stricture recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H3792073659\" class=\"local\">'Immediate open repair'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a posterior urethral injury caused by blunt trauma who do not require immediate open surgery, we suggest suprapubic drainage followed by delayed repair in three to six months, rather than immediate endoscopic realignment within 24 to 72 hours post-injury (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The delay allows the pelvic hematoma to resolve, the prostate to descend, the urethral defect to shorten, and the patient's other injuries to heal before the reconstructive operation. (See <a href=\"#H3261403190\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regardless of the surgeon's choice for delayed versus immediate <span class=\"nowrap\">repair/realignment,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> must promptly establish urinary drainage, most commonly with a suprapubic tube (SPT). (See <a href=\"#H1637838291\" class=\"local\">'Suprapubic tube (SPT) drainage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the majority of patients with a posterior urethral injury due to blunt trauma, the definitive repair should be delayed until the patient is stable enough to undergo an elective procedure. We use a one-stage perineal anastomotic urethroplasty technique that uses one to four steps sequentially, as required by the magnitude of the urethral defect, to accomplish a tension-free bulboprostatic anastomosis. (See <a href=\"#H2280517151\" class=\"local\">'Delayed open repair'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed endoscopic realignment is an option for patients who have stabilized enough to return to the operating room 5 to 10 days after injury for a separate reason, such as orthopedic instrumentation, placement of hardware, or wound care interventions. However, when facing difficulty with any endoscopic intervention, the safest strategy is to simply place a suprapubic tube and defer to a delayed urethral reconstruction at a later time to avoid worsening the injury.
