These requirements are currently best met by arteriovenous (AV) access. Although AV fistulas are preferred for hemodialysis, AV grafts are sometimes necessary but have higher failure rates. Failure can be related to stenotic lesions affecting the feeding arteries, within the graft or in the draining veins, including the central veins. AV graft failure can also be related to complications such as pseudoaneurysm or other conditions that lead to sacrifice of the graft.</p><p>The treatment of AV graft failure due to venous stenosis and thrombotic complications are reviewed here. Issues surrounding clinical monitoring and surveillance of AV grafts to prevent thrombosis are presented in detail separately.

More than 90 percent of thrombosed AV grafts have a stenotic lesion, suggesting that such an anatomic abnormality is required for AV graft thrombosis. The majority of AV grafts develop stenosis or thrombosis. Among 649 patients with new AV grafts enrolled in the Dialysis Access Consortium (DAC) Study, 77 percent developed stenosis or thrombosis within the first year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Similarly, among 201 patients with a new AV graft enrolled in the Fish Oil Inhibition of Stenosis in Hemodialysis Grafts (FISH) Study, 62 percent developed stenosis or thrombosis within one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H549425723\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349842688\"><span class=\"h3\">Immediate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediate failure of AV grafts following their creation is usually due to technical issues, often related to creation of an inadequate anastomosis as a result of severe arterial calcification. A large, single-center study observed immediate failure in 5.8 percent of upper extremity AV grafts and 12.7 percent of thigh grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Critical stenosis can lead to sudden AV graft thrombosis. Less commonly, approximately 15 percent of AV grafts fail due to infection. In a large single-center observational study of 310 AV grafts, 80 percent of graft failures were due to thrombosis, 14 percent were due to infection, and 3 percent were due to a large pseudoaneurysm with impending rupture. The remainder (2 percent) were caused by intractable central vein stenosis requiring AV graft ligation, and distal ischemia (steal syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

Correcting the stenosis may decrease the risk of thrombosis and improve graft patency; however, randomized trials have not proven this to be the case (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110941\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110941 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Nevertheless, since it is safe, effective, and easily performed, we suggest preemptive angioplasty for the treatment of clinically significant stenosis affecting AV grafts for the reasons given above. Representative studies that illustrate this point are reviewed briefly below for AV grafts. The indications and benefits of percutaneous angioplasty are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular intervention for the treatment of stenosis in the arteriovenous access&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques for angioplasty of the arteriovenous hemodialysis access&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a small trial, 21 patients with &gt;50 percent AV graft stenosis who had never undergone any procedure following graft placement were randomly assigned to no treatment (13 cases) or angioplasty (8 cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In the treatment group, patency was significantly prolonged, and the thrombosis rate was significantly decreased compared with no preemptive treatment (0.10 versus 0.44 per patient-dialysis years).

Patients either had traditional screening consisting of regular AV graft examination and monitoring of venous pressure or traditional screening plus ultrasound examinations every three months. The secondary cumulative AV access patency was significantly longer in group 1 compared with group 2 at 6, 12, and 24 months follow-up.

As an example, even a patch angioplasty results in the loss of a small portion of vein. Since venous stenosis is a recurrent problem, this may result in a progressive loss of venous anatomy available for future AV access creation. Additional adverse effects include postoperative pain and the occasional need for a temporary central catheter access following the operation. Nevertheless, there are certain lesions that may not respond to angioplasty or are unsuitable for angioplasty. These should be referred for surgical revision. As an example, a tight stenosis associated with a previous thrombosis tends to respond poorly to angioplasty and generally requires surgical correction. One study found that thrombosed grafts with unsuccessful percutaneous thrombectomy almost always (92 percent of cases) have a stenotic lesion at a location other than the venous anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In addition, following an unsuccessful percutaneous graft thrombectomy, successful salvage by surgical revision was feasible in only 8 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

At the authors' institution, thrombosed AV grafts are most commonly treated percutaneously with thrombectomy in conjunction with balloon angioplasty of any identified underlying stenotic lesions. However, surgical thrombectomy and revision are used for grafts that thrombose within one month of their creation, or in cases for which the percutaneous approach is unsuccessful (ie, stenosis refractory to angioplasty, rapid recurrence of thrombosis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1904718984\"><span class=\"h2\">Percutaneous thrombolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With a percutaneous approach, either pharmacologic agents, mechanical clot disruption, or a combination (pharmacomechanical thrombolysis) may be used, provided there are no contraindications to thrombolytic therapy (such as recent surgery, a bleeding disorder, a recent bleeding episode, or severe hypertension). If flow in the graft is restored, a fistulogram can then be performed to identify any associated stenoses, which can be treated with angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure/abstract/14,18,33-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18,33-38</a>].

Alteplase is delivered into the entire portion of the thrombosed access using a 4-Fr (French) catheter. The operator waits at least 15 to 30 minutes before proceeding to clot removal and subsequent angioplasty of the stenotic lesion. Care must be taken since the thrombolytic agent can be inadvertently delivered directly into the systemic circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. </p><p>Mechanical thrombolysis using specialized devices has been reported without use of any lytic agent. As examples, one study found that the Amplatz thrombectomy device and pulse-spray pharmacomechanical thrombolysis were similarly successful in recanalizing thrombosed grafts, with comparable primary patency rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Another study found similar technical success for mechanical clot disruption alone compared with pharmacomechanical clot disruption using urokinase, but AV grafts treated with mechanical thrombectomy had improved long-term patency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>A concern with percutaneous thrombolysis is the potential for clinically significant pulmonary emboli. In a review of over 650 cases, only one clinically apparent pulmonary embolus was documented (the symptoms of which resolved within 24 hours), and two patients developed transient chest pain of undetermined etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. A second well-designed study compared ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy before and after thrombolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In this study, 13 patients had clotted AV grafts, 9 of whom underwent mechanical thrombolysis alone, and the remainder had pharmacomechanical thrombolysis with urokinase. No patient had radiographic evidence of pulmonary embolism. To reduce the possibility of large pulmonary emboli, a device has been developed that consists of a high-speed rotating cam tip that pulverizes the clot into tiny particles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2572223932\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical thrombectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical thrombectomy is a relatively quick procedure, has a very low complication rate, and is initially successful in 90 percent of cases. However, failure to correct the underlying outflow stenosis, which can be accomplished using percutaneous or open techniques, will lead to rapid rethrombosis.</p><p>Although not adequately studied, it appears that surgical treatment for AV graft thrombosis is comparable to percutaneous intervention. This was shown in a meta-analysis of eight randomized studies, in which similar results with both techniques were reported for studies published after 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The primary patency of AV grafts after surgical thrombectomy and angioplasty ranged from 30 to 60 percent at three months and 10 to 40 percent at six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>].</p><p>Surgical thrombectomy involves making a small incision overlying, typically, the venous outflow limb of the AV graft and then using a Fogarty embolectomy catheter to sequentially remove clot first from the graft and then from the venous and arterial anastomoses. A graft study (graftogram, on-table duplex ultrasound) can be performed to determine if any significant inflow or outflow stenoses are present. These can be managed using open surgical revision (patch angioplasty, jump graft). With the availability of intraoperative fluoroscopy imaging (mobile C-arm, hybrid operating room), balloon angioplasty of any identified lesions can be performed just as would be performed in an interventional radiology suite. Alternatively, in the absence of intraoperative imaging, vascular dilators can be passed through at least the venous anastomosis, the most likely site of stenosis. Interrogation of the arterial anastomosis may require extension of the incision or a separate incision and arterial limb graftotomy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4176657384\"><span class=\"h2\">Antithrombotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following treatment of AV graft thrombosis, recurrent thrombosis is common and, although mechanical treatment of the underlying lesion using angioplasty reduces it, does not eliminate the lesion.

Immediate failure in the postoperative period is usually due to technical issues. AV graft dysfunction and failure beyond the postoperative period (ie, delayed graft failure) is predominantly related to stenotic vascular lesions. AV graft failure can also be related to complications such as infection, pseudoaneurysm, or other conditions that lead to sacrifice of the graft. (See <a href=\"#H704912434\" class=\"local\">'AV graft dysfunction and failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with an abnormal clinical examination or abnormalities on monitoring and surveillance, the cause of the problem may be obvious on physical examination of the AV graft. Most cases of AV graft thrombosis are preceded by progressive stenosis at the vein-graft anastomosis that can be documented by access surveillance or clinical monitoring. However, up to 25 percent of AV grafts clot fairly abruptly without prior indication of critical stenosis. (See <a href=\"#H1404642931\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although most AV grafts requiring treatment have only one stenotic site, up to 30 percent can have two or more stenotic sites. A clinically significant stenosis in an AV graft is defined as a greater than 50 percent narrowing of the diameter with abnormal clinical findings, such as decreasing intragraft blood flow (less than 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> or elevated static pressure within the graft. Affected sites of associated stenotic lesions in AV grafts are listed above and described in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"#H4089482630\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of stenotic lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stenotic vascular lesions can be treated percutaneously with angioplasty, or with surgery. For patients identified with stenosis of hemodialysis access grafts, we recommend preemptive percutaneous angioplasty rather than surgery as the initial procedure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Lesions unsuitable for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty can be referred for surgical revision. Even with excellent technical success rates, which approach 100 percent, the low rates of AV graft patency are discouraging. (See <a href=\"#H852999487\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of stenosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once thrombosis of an AV graft has occurred, treatment options include percutaneous or surgical thrombectomy, in conjunction with angioplasty (balloon, patch) of any identified underlying stenotic lesions. The approach chosen is largely based upon local practice and expertise. The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative <span class=\"nowrap\">(K/DOQI)</span> guidelines recommend that each institution should determine which initial approach is preferred. Following percutaneous thrombectomy, patency for AV grafts is slightly better compared with AV fistulas. Primary patency of the underlying stenotic lesion is much worse following thrombectomy compared with preemptive angioplasty. (See <a href=\"#H402952213\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of thrombosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Dixon BS, Beck GJ, Vazquez MA, et al.
