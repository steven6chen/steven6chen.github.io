It works by making you take in fewer calories and nutrients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2356816\"><span class=\"h1\">Who can have weight loss surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors use a measure called &quot;body mass index,&quot; or BMI, to decide who can have weight loss surgery. Your BMI will tell you whether your weight is normal for your height (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F62886\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62886 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Weight loss surgery is appropriate only if you have not been able to lose weight through other means and if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a BMI above 40 and have not responded to diet, exercise, or weight loss medicines; or</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a BMI above 35 and also have a medical problem related to obesity, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure; or</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a BMI above 30, but only if you have certain medical conditions</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2356831\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there different types of weight loss surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are many different types. The most common are (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F89547\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89547 \">figure 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastric banding</strong> &ndash; For this surgery, the doctor wraps an adjustable plastic band around the top of your stomach, making a small pouch. (&quot;Gastric&quot; means the same thing as &quot;stomach.&quot;) The doctor can add or remove fluid through a button under your skin that is connected to the band with tubing. That way, the doctor can adjust how tight the band is. The tighter the band wraps around the stomach, the slower food passes from the pouch to the rest of the stomach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastric bypass</strong> &ndash; Gastric bypass is short for &quot;Roux-en-Y gastric bypass,&quot; and is sometimes called &quot;RYGB.&quot; For this surgery the doctor closes off part of the stomach, leaving only a small pouch for food. Then he or she connects the stomach pouch to the middle part of the small intestine. This allows food to &quot;bypass&quot; or reroute around a part of the stomach and small intestine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastric sleeve</strong> &ndash; Gastric sleeve, also known as &quot;sleeve gastrectomy,&quot; is a surgery that turns the stomach into something that looks like a sleeve. In other words, the doctor removes a large portion of the stomach and leaves a narrow tube.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastric balloon</strong> &ndash; Gastric balloon is a procedure, but it is not actually surgery. It does not involve cutting the skin the way the other options do. For this, the doctor puts a special balloon into your stomach. He or she does this using a thin tube that goes into your mouth and down your throat. The balloon stays in your stomach for up to 6 months. While it is there, your stomach has less space for food, which limits the amount you can eat at one time.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2356846\"><span class=\"h1\">How is the surgery done?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastric banding, gastric bypass, and gastric sleeve can all be done as &quot;open&quot; surgery or as &quot;laparoscopic&quot; surgery. For open surgery, the surgeon cuts open the belly and works on the organs directly. For laparoscopic surgery, the surgeon makes a small cut and inserts a narrow tool that has a tiny camera on the end into the belly. This tool is called a &quot;laparoscope.&quot; It allows the surgeon to see inside the belly without opening it up all the way. Then the surgeon can do the surgery using other tools that fit through small openings in the belly and that can be controlled from the outside.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2356861\"><span class=\"h1\">How do the different procedures compare?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each type of weight loss surgery is different, and each has different benefits and downsides.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric banding is probably the simplest form of weight loss surgery. It involves less cutting than gastric bypass or gastric sleeve. It can also be adjusted or even undone. Gastric banding also leads to less weight loss compared with gastric bypass or gastric sleeve. Because of this, fewer people get gastric banding than the other types surgery. Plus, people who have gastric banding need to see the doctor often for adjustments, and some end up needing the band taken out.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric bypass leads to the most weight loss and works the fastest, but it involves the most serious surgery with the highest risks. It can also cause problems in how your body absorbs nutrients. As a result it can lead to &quot;nutritional deficiencies,&quot; meaning that your body is missing important nutrients. This can sometimes make you sick. If you have gastric bypass, your doctor will monitor your nutrient levels afterward.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleeve gastrectomy is safer than gastric bypass because it does not involve rerouting or cutting and reattaching the intestines, and because it is less likely to cause problems with how your absorb nutrients. It might also be safer than the gastric banding because it does not involve any plastic materials that stay in your body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric balloon is becoming a more popular option for weight loss. That's because it is safe, easy to do, and does not involve any cutting. But, it also does not lead to as much weight loss as the surgery options. After the balloon is removed, some, but not all, people are able to keep the weight off.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2356876\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know which surgery is best for me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision about which type of surgery to have is important. Discuss your choices with your doctor.</p><p>If you have different options, ask the following questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>About how much weight can I expect to lose with each option?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How long will it take me to lose the weight?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the risks of each option for someone like me?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What changes will I need to make to my diet and lifestyle with each option?</p><p/><p>Whatever you decide, make sure your surgeon is very experienced with weight loss surgery. Also, check with the staff at your treatment center or make sure it is a certified &quot;Center of Excellence.&quot; Those centers have a team of nurses and doctors who specialize in taking care of patients like you. If you are at all unsure about your decision, you can ask for an opinion from another doctor. Most hospitals that have experience with weight loss surgery offer patient education sessions where you can learn more about weight loss surgery and the options you have.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2356891\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the benefits of surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to helping you lose weight, surgery can help improve or even get rid of certain health problems, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High cholesterol</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep apnea, a disorder that causes you to stop breathing for short amounts of time while you sleep</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2356908\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the risks of surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risks of surgery are different depending on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What type of weight loss surgery you have</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether your surgery is open or laparoscopic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your age and overall health</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How experienced your surgeon is</p><p/><p>In general the risks could include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection inside the belly or in the wounds from surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leaks from the incisions on the stomach or intestine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blockage or tear in the intestines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the heart or lungs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gallstones</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutritional problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The need for more surgery</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2356925\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need to change the way I eat after surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Work with a nutritionist (a food expert) to learn how your diet should change.</p><p>You will need to eat healthy foods that &quot;work with&quot; your surgery. For example, you should choose foods high in protein and low in fat and calories. You should also avoid liquid foods that are high in calories, such as ice cream. If you eat the wrong things, you could hurt your chances of losing weight.</p><p>If you have weight loss surgery, you will need to avoid certain foods that could make you sick. Plus you will probably need to take special multivitamins with minerals. That's because weight loss surgery, especially gastric bypass, can make it hard for your body to get all the nutrition it needs. You must keep taking the vitamins for the rest of your life. Your body will always need them to stay healthy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2356940\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-treatments-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Weight loss treatments (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=minimally-invasive-surgery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Minimally invasive surgery (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=health-risks-of-obesity-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Health risks of obesity (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-after-weight-loss-surgery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Care after weight loss surgery (The Basics)</a> </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-treatments-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Weight loss treatments (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-surgery-and-procedures-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Weight loss surgery and procedures (Beyond the Basics)</a> </p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
