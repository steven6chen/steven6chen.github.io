Acid-base balance is maintained by normal elimination of carbon dioxide by the lungs (which affects the partial pressure of carbon dioxide [PCO2]) and normal excretion of nonvolatile acid by the kidneys (which affects the plasma bicarbonate concentration). The hydrogen ion concentration of the blood is determined by the ratio of the PCO2 and plasma bicarbonate concentration.

Elimination of this acid load is achieved by the urinary excretion of hydrogen ions, both as titratable acidity and as ammonium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-consequences-and-treatment-of-metabolic-acidosis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Near-normal balance can be maintained even if the acid load is modestly increased since net acid excretion rises appropriately, primarily via increased ammonium production and excretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60880\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60880 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-consequences-and-treatment-of-metabolic-acidosis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Development of metabolic acidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metabolic acidosis can develop as a result of one or more of the following pathophysiologic processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-consequences-and-treatment-of-metabolic-acidosis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased production of nonvolatile acids </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased loss of bicarbonate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased renal excretion of acid </p><p/><p>Metabolic acidosis is commonly associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-consequences-and-treatment-of-metabolic-acidosis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. As the number of functioning nephrons declines in CKD, acid excretion is initially maintained by an increase in the ammonium excreted per nephron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-consequences-and-treatment-of-metabolic-acidosis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

At this level of renal function, ammonium excretion per total GFR is three to four times above normal, suggesting that the impairment in ammonium excretion is caused by too few functioning nephrons rather than impaired function in the remaining nephrons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-consequences-and-treatment-of-metabolic-acidosis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. </p><p>As a result, CKD leads to retention of hydrogen ions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-consequences-and-treatment-of-metabolic-acidosis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1,6,8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,8,10</a>]. In addition to the fall in ammonium excretion, diminished excretion of titratable acid (primarily as phosphoric acid) also may play a role in the pathogenesis of metabolic acidosis in patients with advanced kidney disease. Both dietary phosphate restriction and the use of oral phosphate binders to prevent hyperphosphatemia may contribute to the fall in phosphate excretion. </p><p>The retained acid is buffered by bicarbonate in the extracellular fluid, by tissue buffers, and by bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-consequences-and-treatment-of-metabolic-acidosis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. With worsening renal function, however, progressive metabolic acidosis and acidemia can develop. As a result, metabolic acidosis and acidemia become more common with advancing stages of CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-consequences-and-treatment-of-metabolic-acidosis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The prevalence of a serum bicarbonate concentration of &lt;22 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L,</span> for example, is &lt;5 percent in CKD stages 1 and 2 and increases linearly to approximately 25 percent in patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD stage G5 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F70597\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70597 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-consequences-and-treatment-of-metabolic-acidosis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

A level below 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> is unusual since buffering of the retained hydrogen ions prevents a progressive fall in the plasma bicarbonate concentration. Typically, the anion gap remains normal until late stages of CKD when it begins to widen due to the retention of anions such as phosphate, sulfate, urate, and hippurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-consequences-and-treatment-of-metabolic-acidosis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

If blood samples are transported from the dialysis clinic to the clinical laboratory by air freight, delayed centrifugation of the specimen may lead to increased lactic acid production by blood cells; this can artifactually reduce the plasma bicarbonate concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-consequences-and-treatment-of-metabolic-acidosis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>In contrast, a small number of patients with ESRD have a normal plasma bicarbonate concentration and anion gap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-consequences-and-treatment-of-metabolic-acidosis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A reduced daily acid load caused by decreased protein intake (which diminishes both acid and sulfate generation) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased fruit intake (which provides citrate that is converted to bicarbonate) are the most likely explanations. For unclear reasons, most patients with ESRD who have a normal plasma bicarbonate and a normal anion gap also have diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-consequences-and-treatment-of-metabolic-acidosis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>A superimposed metabolic alkalosis (as occurs with vomiting or diuretic therapy) is another factor that could normalize the plasma bicarbonate concentration in advanced renal failure.
