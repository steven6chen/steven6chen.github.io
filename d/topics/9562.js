Jaundice is common in newborn babies and can happen within days of a baby's birth. Babies are usually checked for jaundice for a few days after they are born.</p><p>Jaundice happens when a baby has high levels of a substance called &quot;bilirubin&quot; in the blood. Jaundice is a sign that a doctor needs to do a blood test to check the baby's bilirubin level.</p><p>Babies can have high bilirubin levels for different reasons. For example, some babies who breastfeed can get jaundice because they do not get as much breast milk as they need.</p><p>It is important that a baby gets checked for jaundice to see if he or she needs treatment, because very high bilirubin levels can lead to brain damage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478055259\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I tell if my baby has jaundice?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can tell if your baby has jaundice by pressing one finger on your baby's nose or forehead. Then lift up your finger. If the skin is yellow where you pressed, your baby has jaundice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478055266\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of jaundice?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Jaundice causes the skin and the white parts of the eyes to turn yellow. It often happens first in the face, but can spread to the chest, belly, and arms. It spreads to the legs last.</p><p>Sometimes, jaundice can be severe. A baby with severe jaundice can have orange-yellow skin, or yellow skin below the knee on the lower part of the leg. The &quot;whites&quot; of the eyes might look yellow, too. A baby with severe jaundice might also:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be hard to wake up</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a high-pitched cry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be unhappy and keep crying</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep bending his or her body or neck backward</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478055273\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your baby's jaundice is getting worse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your baby has symptoms of severe jaundice</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478055280\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for jaundice?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. A doctor can do an exam and a blood test to check for jaundice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478055287\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to help the jaundice get better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To help your baby's jaundice get better, you can make sure your baby drinks enough. If you breastfeed your baby, make sure you breastfeed often and in the right way. If you feed your baby formula, make sure your baby drinks enough formula. If you are worried that your baby is not drinking enough, talk with your doctor or nurse.</p><p>You can tell that your baby is drinking enough if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>He or she has 6 or more wet diapers a day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>His or her bowel movements change from dark green to yellow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>He or she seems happy after feeding</p><p/><p>Some babies do not need any other treatment for their jaundice. This is because their bilirubin levels are only a little high, and the jaundice will get better on its own. But other babies will need treatment. Babies who need treatment might have higher levels of bilirubin or they might have been born early.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478055294\"><span class=\"h1\">How is jaundice treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common treatment for jaundice is called &quot;light therapy.&quot; During light therapy, a doctor puts the baby under a special blue light (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55964\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55964 \">picture 1</a>) or wraps a &quot;light blanket&quot; around him or her (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73723\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73723 \">picture 2</a>). Babies who get light therapy are usually naked or wear only a diaper so that the light can shine on their skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478055301\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breastfeeding (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=poor-weight-gain-in-babies-and-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Poor weight gain in babies and children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-a-baby-is-born-premature-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When a baby is born premature (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=jaundice-in-newborn-infants-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Jaundice in newborn infants (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-guide-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Breastfeeding guide (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-breastfeeding-problems-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Common breastfeeding problems (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
