The parasite is mainly acquired during childhood and adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. After becoming infected, the large majority of immunocompetent humans in European and North American studies are able to limit the spread of the parasite and the associated tissue damage, ensuring that the parasite remains in its dormant form in neural and muscle tissue (latent infection) for the life of the host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In immunosuppressed patients, especially patients with AIDS, the parasite can reactivate and cause disease.</p><p>When toxoplasmic infection is acquired for the first time during pregnancy or is reactivated, the parasites can be transmitted from the mother to the fetus, resulting in congenital toxoplasmosis. The frequency of congenital toxoplasmosis increases with increasing gestational age at maternal infection, but the frequency of severe sequelae in infected offspring is greater when infection is early in pregnancy.</p><p>This topic will focus on issues related to <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> infection during pregnancy. Other aspects of this infection are reviewed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-testing-for-toxoplasmosis-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic testing for toxoplasmosis infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasmosis in immunocompetent hosts&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-toxoplasmosis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital toxoplasmosis: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-toxoplasmosis-treatment-outcome-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital toxoplasmosis: Treatment, outcome, and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MATERNAL INFECTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3692861350\"><span class=\"h2\">Sources of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>T. gondii</em> is an obligate intracellular parasite that exists in three forms: the sporozoite (in sporulated oocysts), which is shed only in cat feces; the tachyzoite (a rapidly dividing form observed in the acute phase of infection); and the bradyzoite (a slow-growing form observed within tissue cysts) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p>Cats are the only animals in which <em>T. gondii</em> can complete its reproductive cycle. During a primary feline infection, a cat can shed millions of oocysts daily from its alimentary canal for a period of one to three weeks. These oocysts become infective (sporulated) one to five days later and may remain infectious for over a year, especially in warm, humid environments. Cats typically develop immunity after a primary infection; therefore, recurrent infection with passage of oocysts is unlikely.</p><p>In developed temperate-climate countries, the main source of maternal infection is thought to be ingestion of bradyzoites contained in raw, undercooked, or cured meat or meat products. Maternal ingestion of sporozoites from consumption of contaminated soil or water or soil-contaminated fruit or vegetables is also a major source of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/2-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-9</a>]. Food animals (pigs, chickens, lambs, goats) become infected by the same routes as humans, resulting in meat containing bradyzoites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Other potential sources of maternal infection include drinking unpasteurized goat's milk and eating raw oysters, clams, or mussels (ie, filter feeders) harvested from contaminated water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. An infected organ transplant or blood transfusion is a rare source of infection.</p><p>In a study from the United States, household members of a patient with acute toxoplasmosis were at higher risk of infection, which suggest a common environmental or food source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3868472132\"><span class=\"h2\">Seroprevalence among women of childbearing age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In industrially developed, temperate-climate countries, 10 to 50 percent of adults aged 15 to 45 years display serological evidence of past <em>T. gondii</em> infection, which represents a decline in seroprevalence over recent decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/1,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16</a>]. Prevalence varies widely in Europe: Norway (7 percent), United Kingdom (10 percent), Italy (19 percent), Spain (32 percent), Austria (33 percent), Slovenia (34 percent), and France (37 to 44 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In the United States, the age-adjusted seroprevalence among women of childbearing age (15 to 44 years) was 9 percent in 2009 to 2010 compared with 11 percent in 1999 to 2004 and 15 percent in 1988 to 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Much higher seroprevalence rates (up to 80 percent) are found in some areas of the tropics, particularly in communities exposed to contaminated soil, undercooked meat, or unfiltered water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/2-4,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,19-21</a>]. In other reports, seroprevalence was 8 to 37 percent in India [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], 28 percent in Thailand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and 39 percent in Trinidad and Tobago [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence of acute primary infection in pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of acute maternal infection during pregnancy is reported to range from 1 to 8 per 1000 susceptible pregnancies, with the highest rates in France [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, the rate in France has significantly decreased in the past decade; the incidence of <em>T. gondii</em> infection diagnosed by seroconversion in French women was 2.1 per 1000 pregnancies in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In the United States, the estimated incidence of acute primary infection is 0.2 per 1000 pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute maternal infection is usually asymptomatic. When symptoms of infection occur, they are typically nonspecific and mild: fever, chills, sweats, headaches, myalgias, pharyngitis, hepatosplenomegaly, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a diffuse nonpruritic maculopapular rash. The febrile episodes usually last two to three days.</p><p>A common and more specific symptom of acute toxoplasmosis is bilateral, symmetrical, nontender cervical adenopathy; approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients develop generalized lymphadenopathy. The lymph nodes are usually smaller than 3 centimeters in size and are nonfluctuant. Unlike the fever, which lasts for a short duration, lymphadenopathy can persist for weeks. In a prospective European cohort study, lymphadenopathy was noted in 7 percent of 1144 infected pregnant women before diagnosis of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Ocular disease (chorioretinitis [posterior uveitis]) may occur with acute disease but is more common with reactivation. It presents with visual loss or floaters.

Parts of Europe have taken a different approach; serial screening is performed at monthly, bimonthly, or every three-month intervals throughout pregnancy as part of a routine prenatal care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/28,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,33</a>].</p><p>In North America and the United Kingdom, the consensus opinion is against screening because the prevalence of the disease is relatively low, standardized serologic assays are not available except in a few reference laboratories, highly effective treatment is not available, and screening is costly. Screening needs to be frequent (every three weeks) to increase the chance of detecting and, in turn, treating asymptomatic infection early (ie, with four weeks of infection), when treatment might prevent fetal infection and fetal damage. However, frequent rescreening also increases costs and unnecessary treatment of women with false-positive results, and it is difficult to implement: only 40 percent of French women in one study had all of the repeat screening tests that they were supposed to have [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. These limitations have to be weighed against potential benefits of treatment, which appears to reduce the risk of death and serious neurological sequelae of congenital toxoplasmosis but may not reduce mild congenital disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>] (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Effect of prenatal treatment'</a> below). Although two economic studies concluded that prenatal screening is cost-effective by assuming that prenatal treatment substantially reduces mother-to-child transmission of infection, the analyses used flawed comparisons of historical case series, before and after screening introduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/17,37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,37-39</a>], and excluded evidence from a large meta-analysis of all available cohort studies that found weak evidence for reduced transmission with treatment even with the monthly screening approach in France [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Randomized trials are needed to provide better information on the absolute and relative benefits and harms of screening. In addition, the balance of risks and benefits must be estimated by individual <span class=\"nowrap\">countries/continents/regions</span> as the balance shifts depending on disease prevalence and prevalence of more virulent strains of <em>T. gondii</em> (Western Europe has mostly less virulent strains, and South America has more virulent strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2447727387\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpretation of screening results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in asymptomatic pregnant women who screen positive is complicated because determining whether infection occurred prior to conception or during pregnancy is critical and false-positive tests are common. Although a toxoplasmosis pregnancy panel from a nonreference laboratory (eg, commercial, clinic, or hospital laboratory) can be used for initial screening, the diagnosis should be confirmed by an experienced reference laboratory (in the United States: <a href=\"http://www.pamf.org/serology&amp;token=oLXb6NSMOZdF35h7AB6nuT+HWs6zZ60BRYLidILEJljvBW2ZRMEMFkqRFWwBc6Pg&amp;TOPIC_ID=6756\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Toxoplasmosis Serology Laboratory, Palo Alto Medical Foundation</a>, 650-853-4828).</p><p>As a brief synopsis, IgM antibodies appear as early as two weeks after infection and may persist for years, while IgG antibodies peak six to eight weeks after infection and then decline over the next two years but remain positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The diagnosis of recent toxoplasmosis can be made with greatest confidence when both IgM and IgG seroconversion are documented on serial testing. However, paired serologies showing this type of response are uncommon. Instead, serologic assays often demonstrate both positive IgM and IgG antibodies at the first prenatal visit. For women who are initially tested at the end of the first trimester and have positive IgM and IgG, the probability that infection occurred after conception is 1 to 3 percent, depending on the test used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The timing of infection in these cases is difficult to determine. To establish whether the positive IgM and IgG antibodies reflect recent or chronic infection or a false-positive result, confirmatory testing must be obtained with avidity testing. High IgG avidity is a hallmark of chronic infection (&gt;4 months old), but low avidity is not diagnostic of recent infection, as low IgG avidity can persist for years in some women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. The usefulness of a rising IgG titer for diagnosis of acute infection has never been adequately evaluated and is subject to error because of lack of reproducibility in many laboratories.

It is likely that transmission occurs in most cases during the parasitemic phase in the days after maternal infection and before the development of a maternal serologic response. Tachyzoites invade host cells, especially in the brain and muscle. In immunocompetent animal models, tissue cysts in neural and muscle tissue can be formed within a week of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. It is not known how long this process takes in the relatively immunologically immature fetus. The time for transition from acute infective tachyzoite form, which is responsible for tissue destruction in the fetal brain, to the dormant bradyzoite form contained in tissue cysts is clinically important because the cysts are impenetrable to antibiotics. This time is considered the therapeutic &quot;window of opportunity&quot; when maternal administration of antibiotics may prevent or reduce fetal neurologic damage. Although a marked maternal immune response to prior <em>T. gondii</em> infection prevents fetal infection, once fetal infection has occurred, maternal IgG does not mitigate fetal sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10111824\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors for fetal infection from recent maternal infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for maternal-fetal transmission include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal infection at an advanced gestational age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-virulence <em>T. gondii</em> strain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High parasite load</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal parasite source (risk of fetal infection is higher when the source is sporozoites in oocysts [cat feces] than bradyzoites in tissue cysts [meat] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74001\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74001 \">figure 1</a>))</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal immunocompromise</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4007921749\"><span class=\"h3\">Impact of gestational age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency of fetal infection increases steeply with advancing gestational age at the time of maternal seroconversion. A meta-analysis of all available cohorts estimated the probability of transmission to be 15 percent with seroconversion documented at 13 weeks, 44 percent at 26 weeks, and 71 percent at 36 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Although these figures are based on women who were mostly treated during pregnancy, they are likely generalizable to untreated women, as there is only weak evidence that prenatal treatment administered in screening programs reduces the risk of mother-to-child transmission of toxoplasmosis. (See <a href=\"#H883764799\" class=\"local\">'Evidence regarding mother-to-child transmission'</a> below.)</p><p>Although the frequency of fetal infection increases with gestational age at maternal seroconversion, the risk of developing clinical sequelae decreases. In the systematic review on congenital toxoplasmosis (SYROCOT) study, the odds of developing clinical sequelae decreased by 4 percent per additional week of gestation at seroconversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In another study, the frequency of symptomatic disease after seroconversion at 13, 26, and 36 weeks was 61, 25, and 9 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

However, in the European Collaborative Study, a large prospective study of children born to HIV-infected women, 451 children recruited to the study were born to mothers with anti-<em>Toxoplasma </em>IgG antibody, and none of these children had clinical evidence of congenital toxoplasmosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Congenital infection was excluded serologically in a subgroup of 71 children.

Serious neurologic sequelae included a diagnosis of cerebral palsy, microcephaly, or bilateral blindness or hydrocephalus or epilepsy requiring treatment. Death included both postnatal death before age 2 years and terminations of pregnancy because of congenital toxoplasmosis; stillbirths were excluded because fetal demise is not a well-documented sequelae of congenital toxoplasmosis.

Evidence from case-control studies of risk factors in Europe has identified the principal sources of infection, which should be avoided when possible.

If such travel is necessary, it is particularly important to adhere to the following behaviors to reduce the risk of infection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid drinking unfiltered water in any setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy/abstract/3,4,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,96</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid ingesting soil by observing strict hand hygiene after touching soil (eg, gardening).

Hand washing is the single most important measure to reduce transmission of microorganisms from one site to another.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raw or undercooked meat is an important source of infection. Cutting boards, knives, counters, and the sink should be washed after food preparation. Avoid mucous membrane contact when handling uncooked meat.

(See <a href=\"#H3692861350\" class=\"local\">'Sources of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute maternal infection is usually asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they are typically nonspecific and mild: fever, chills, sweats, headaches, myalgias, pharyngitis, hepatosplenomegaly, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a diffuse nonpruritic maculopapular rash. A more specific symptom is bilateral, symmetrical, nontender cervical adenopathy, which occurs in approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients. Lymphadenopathy can persist for weeks. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal infection usually results from transplacental transmission of tachyzoites following a recent primary maternal infection. Fetal infection rarely occurs from reinfection with a different toxoplasmosis strain and is unlikely during reactivation disease since parasitemia does not occur. (See <a href=\"#H3370866817\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of fetal infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of fetal infection increases with advancing gestational age at the time of maternal infection (eg, the probability of maternal-fetal transmission at 13 and 36 weeks of gestation is 15 and 71 percent, respectfully). By contrast, the risk of developing symptomatic congenital disease after seroconversion decreases with gestational age (eg, the probability of symptomatic disease from congenital infection at 13 and 36 weeks is 61 and 9 percent, respectively). (See <a href=\"#H4007921749\" class=\"local\">'Impact of gestational age'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2621555118\" class=\"local\">'Risk of fetal infection from reactivation or reinfection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In North America and the United Kingdom, we suggest not screening for toxoplasmosis in all pregnant women (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This approach is based upon the relatively low prevalence of the disease in these areas, the limited availability of standardized serologic assays (except for a few reference laboratories), the lack of highly effective treatment, and the high cost of screening. However, these limitations should be weighed against potential benefits of treatment (reduced risk of death and serious neurological sequelae) as well as the disease prevalence and availability of resources in specific geographic areas. (See <a href=\"#H2765796154\" class=\"local\">'Should all pregnant women be screened?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If screening is performed, the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in asymptomatic pregnant women who screen positive is complicated because determining whether infection occurred prior to conception or during pregnancy is critical and false-positive tests are common. Additional testing (eg, avidity testing) should be performed to help confirm the diagnosis and clarify when the infection occurred. Although a toxoplasmosis pregnancy panel from a nonreference laboratory (eg, commercial, clinic, or hospital laboratory) can be used for initial screening, confirmatory testing should be performed by an experienced reference laboratory. (See <a href=\"#H2447727387\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of screening results'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-testing-for-toxoplasmosis-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic testing for toxoplasmosis infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal ultrasound findings in congenital toxoplasmosis are nonspecific and similar to findings in other congenital infections. The most common sonographic findings in fetal toxoplasmosis are intracranial hyperechogenic foci or calcifications and cerebral ventricular dilatation, which are poor prognostic signs. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound findings in congenital toxoplasmosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3650679699\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic significance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women with confirmed or possible recent infection, amniocentesis to obtain fluid for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for <em>T. gondii</em> DNA is offered at &ge;18 weeks of gestation for diagnosis of fetal infection. The main purpose of prenatal diagnosis of fetal infection is to guide choice of drug therapy (ie, whether to change prenatal treatment from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spiramycin-united-states-available-via-fda-or-other-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spiramycin</a> to a pyrimethamine-sulfonamide combination).

The best available data suggest that (1) maternal treatment started within three weeks of seroconversion reduces mother-to-child transmission compared with treatment started after eight or more weeks, and (2) maternal treatment reduces the risk of serious neurological sequelae or death in congenitally infected offspring.
