The enzymes necessary for glycogen synthesis and glycogenolysis are present in the fetal liver long before the accumulation of glycogen can be demonstrated. During the last three to four weeks of gestation, hepatic glycogen stores increase to reach around 5 percent of liver weight at birth, a proportion that is higher than at any other time in the life cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In animals, the activity of one or more important rate-limiting enzymes of gluconeogenesis (pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and fructose 1,6 diphosphatase) is absent or very low in the fetus, does not increase until the perinatal period, and reaches adult levels only after several hours to days of extrauterine life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Similarly, in humans, hepatic glucose production and gluconeogenesis are absent during fetal life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], but rapidly increase within the first few hours of life, even in very premature infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>At birth, the interruption of placental blood flow as a result of the clamping of the umbilical cord requires the infant to utilize his or her own endogenous substrates and challenges the newborn with his or her first fast. With the clamping of the cord, there is an immediate release of glucagon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, despite the glucagon surge, plasma glucose decreases over the first two hours of life. This is accompanied by a decrease in insulin and an increase in free fatty acids (FFAs) and ketone bodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. By four to six hours of life, the plasma glucose concentration is stabilized or is increasing in most infants. Much of this early glucose production probably comes from the mobilization of hepatic glycogen, since hepatic glycogen content decreases during the first several days of extrauterine life. This release of hepatic glycogen facilitates a smooth transition from the continuously fed (intrauterine) to the fasted or relatively fasted condition of the first hours to days of extrauterine life. However, hepatic glycogen stores are quickly depleted, and gluconeogenesis must begin within hours of birth to meet an ever-increasing proportion of endogenous glucose production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>].</p><p>In the premature and term infant, more than 90 percent of the glucose is utilized by the brain. This value decreases to approximately 40 percent of glucose turnover in overnight-fasted adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76157\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76157 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The higher rates of glucose turnover per kilogram of body weight in infants and children when compared with adults are consistent with the relatively higher proportion of brain mass to body size, which places infants and children at higher risk of hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Fatty acid mobilization and oxidation play a crucial role in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis in infants and children. Plasma FFAs and ketone bodies can be used by a variety of body tissues and, thus, decrease the demands of these tissues for glucose as an energy source. The brain is unique in that it uses glucose at a rate 20 times that of other body tissues (per gram) and cannot use FFAs directly since they are not transported across the blood-brain barrier. However, ketone bodies (beta-hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetic acid) are transported across the blood-brain barrier, and their metabolism by the brain can partially supplant the need for glucose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The metabolic response to fasting in children is similar to that in adults, except that children have a more rapid decline in plasma glucose concentration and a more rapid increase in the plasma concentration of ketone bodies than do adults. These findings suggest the relatively high glucose requirement in children may accelerate the normal adaptive mechanism(s) of fasting observed in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>During the first 8 to 10 years of life, the rate of total body glucose utilization (and production) increases, followed by a plateau during the next five to seven years, after which the normal adult rate (833 to 944 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/min</span> [150 to 170 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/min])</span> is achieved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64790\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64790 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Studies utilizing isotopically-labeled glucose indicate that, by weight, rates of glucose flux (production and utilization) in adults are approximately 11 to 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/kg</span> per min (2 to 2.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per min) in the overnight postabsorptive state (14-hour fast) and decrease to 9.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/kg</span> per min (1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per min) by 30 hours of fasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The rate of glucose flux in infants and children after 4 to 14 hours of fasting is nearly three times higher (35 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/kg</span> per min [6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per min]) than that of adults, and decreases to 23 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/kg</span> per min (4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per min) after a 30- to 40-hour fast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p>The mobilization, use, and storage of nutrients is primarily orchestrated by the classical actions of hormones (eg, insulin, glucagon, catecholamines, cortisol, and growth hormone), although more subtle interactions of other factors (eg, cytokines, neuronal input, ghrelin, leptin, glucagon-like peptide 1 [GLP1] post-receptor activation mechanism) are now being recognized. Insulin secretion plays a central role in glucose homeostasis and is affected by a number of factors, the most important of which is the plasma glucose concentration. A more detailed description of the secretion and actions of insulin is presented separately. However, we provide a brief description here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreatic-beta-cell-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreatic beta cell function&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulin action&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When the plasma glucose concentration increases after a meal in normal individuals, glucose is transported into the pancreatic beta-cell via the glucose&nbsp;transporter&nbsp;2&nbsp;(GLUT2), is phosphorylated by glucokinase, and metabolized via the glycolytic pathway. This results in an increase in the adenosine <span class=\"nowrap\">triphosphate/adenosine</span> diphosphate <span class=\"nowrap\">(ATP/ADP)</span> ratio, which closes the K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, depolarizes the cell membrane, opening the Ca<sup>++</sup> channels, resulting in fusion of the insulin granule with the plasma membrane causing insulin secretion. Conversely, a decrease in plasma glucose concentration results in decreased glucose metabolism in the beta-cell, which leads to a reduced <span class=\"nowrap\">ATP/ADP</span> ratio, opening of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, hyperpolarization of the cell membrane, and closure of Ca<sup>++</sup> channels, thus blocking Ca<sup>++</sup> influx and reducing insulin secretion. Fundamental problems in these processes can lead to profound hypoglycemia in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>During controlled insulin-induced hypoglycemia, children typically mount a greater counterregulatory hormone response (eg, with cortisol, epinephrine, and glucagon) than do adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. However, with repeated episodes of hypoglycemia, secretion of counterregulatory hormones wanes, leading to defective counterregulation and &quot;hypoglycemia unawareness&quot; in an individual with diabetes. In the absence of classical symptoms of hypoglycemia, perhaps as a result of this process, the diagnosis of hypoglycemia can be missed in some children for months. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION OF HYPOGLYCEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For diagnostic purposes, we define hypoglycemia as a <strong>plasma</strong> glucose value of &le;40 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">/dL</span> (2.22 mM) at any age (except during the first 48 to 72 hours of life). This concentration should trigger a formal evaluation to identify the cause of the hypoglycemia and to prevent its recurrence. This concentration should not be construed as ideal or necessarily safe over time, and should only be used in identifying an individual at risk for <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diagnosing hypoglycemia. </p><p>In newborns, a plasma glucose value of &le;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> is an appropriate threshold to distinguish infants who warrant further diagnostic testing. This threshold was suggested by a consensus conference that focused primarily on the newborn period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This is a relatively conservative threshold, intended to avoid discharging newborns who may be at risk for recurrent and severe hypoglycemia. Similarly, when using a point-of-care (bedside) glucometer, it is reasonable to use a threshold of &le;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> to identify a child who requires further evaluation, including laboratory measurement of plasma glucose. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Critical samples'</a> below.) </p><p>By tradition, laboratories measure plasma glucose (from sodium fluoride, heparin, or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA]-containing tubes). Even point-of-care glucose values are adjusted in their calibration to &quot;plasma concentrations.&quot; Alternatively, whole blood glucose can be measured on a number of glucose analyzers. However, whole blood glucose concentrations are about 15 percent lower than plasma glucose measurements, and this difference should be recognized when interpreting the results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. </p><p>The precise definition of hypoglycemia in infants and children continues to be controversial. This is because normal distributions of glucose values depend on conditions of feeding and fasting, and also vary with clinical factors such as age, gestation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> weight (small, average, or large for gestational age). Despite this natural variation, we use a single threshold to define hypoglycemia for diagnostic purposes because the overall goal of identifying children with hypoglycemia is to protect their central nervous systems from irreparable damage from hypoglycemia. There is no <em>a priori</em> reason that some individuals (eg, a premature or low birth weight infant) should tolerate a low glucose concentration better than others (eg, an older child); in fact, quite the opposite might be argued. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY OF HYPOGLYCEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypoglycemia occurs when the rate of appearance of glucose into the plasma space is less than its rate of utilization. This can be caused by defective glucose production, increased glucose utilization, or some combination of the two. For many hypoglycemic conditions, the mechanism is incompletely understood. </p><p>In infants and children, important causes of hypoglycemia include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F103015\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103015 \">table 1</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inborn errors of metabolism &ndash; Most of the disorders of carbohydrate metabolism and several disorders of amino acid and fat metabolism are characterized by defective glucose production.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypoglycemia in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H118047532\"><span class=\"h2\">Children and adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children and adults, the symptoms of hypoglycemia can be divided into two categories: those caused by the autonomic response to hypoglycemia and those caused by neuroglycopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Neurogenic (autonomic) symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The early manifestations of hypoglycemia are caused by the autonomic response to hypoglycemia and include sweating, weakness, tachycardia, tremor, and feelings of nervousness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hunger. These symptoms and signs usually occur at plasma glucose concentrations between 40 and 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.2 and 3.9 mM), which are higher than the plasma glucose concentrations that trigger neuroglycopenic signs and symptoms. Therefore, the autonomic symptoms function as a &quot;warning system.&quot; However, with repeated or prolonged episodes of hypoglycemia, the threshold for autonomic symptoms decreases to that for neuroglycopenic symptoms. This can result in the appearance of severe symptoms of hypoglycemia with little or no warning, termed &quot;hypoglycemia unawareness.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Glucose homeostasis in normal infants and children'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Neuroglycopenic symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms and signs that develop with prolonged or profound hypoglycemia are caused by insufficient supply of glucose to the brain (neuroglycopenia), and include lethargy, irritability, confusion, uncharacteristic behavior, and hypothermia. In extreme hypoglycemia, loss of consciousness, seizure, or coma may occur. These symptoms and signs occur at plasma glucose concentrations between 10 and 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.5 to 2.8 mM). Severe and repeated episodes of hypoglycemia can result in permanent central nervous system damage, and occasionally in death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H118047526\"><span class=\"h2\">Infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In infants, the signs of hypoglycemia are frequently nonspecific and may include jitteriness, irritability, feeding problems, lethargy, cyanosis, tachypnea, and hypothermia, as well as the signs of severe neuroglycopenia described above. These symptoms are not specific for hypoglycemia and may be early manifestations of a number of other disorders, including septicemia, congenital heart disease, ventricular hemorrhage, and respiratory distress syndrome. Infants are at greatest risk for hypoglycemia during the first few days of life. Neonatal hypoglycemia is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-screening-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypoglycemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, screening, and diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immediate management of the infant or child with hypoglycemia involves obtaining critical samples and administering parenteral glucose. These steps are summarized in a rapid overview (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83485\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83485 \">table 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Critical samples</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the diagnosis of hypoglycemia is suspected and supported by a rapid measurement of the plasma glucose concentration (and beta-hydroxybutyrate, if available as a point-of-care measurement), a sample of blood should be obtained before therapeutic intervention. This sample is used to confirm the diagnosis of hypoglycemia and assess for related electrolyte abnormalities. If the cause of the hypoglycemia is unknown, this critical sample is used for additional biochemical tests to investigate its cause, as discussed below.

The blood should be drawn in the appropriate tubes according to the requirements of individual clinical laboratories. However, most of the studies can be performed on blood treated with heparin or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Blood samples should be transported on ice to the laboratory.

A urine sample should be tested for ketones (if plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate is not available) and reducing substances. The presence of non-glucose reducing substances in the urine suggests galactosemia or hereditary fructose intolerance if other reducing substances (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">streptomycin</a>) are excluded.

The severity of symptoms may or may not predict the severity of the hypoglycemia. Neuroglycopenic symptoms typically occur at lower plasma glucose levels than autonomic symptoms. However, with repeated episodes of hypoglycemia, the threshold glucose concentration for adrenergic symptoms decreases, such that they may not appear before the onset of neuroglycopenic symptoms.

Obtaining critical samples before the initiation of therapy, and collecting the first voided urine sample, can dramatically improve the ability to diagnose the etiology of the hypoglycemia and simplify the subsequent diagnostic evaluation.

The evaluation to determine the cause is guided by the findings of the history, examination, and preliminary laboratory results.
