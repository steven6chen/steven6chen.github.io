However, recovery of cardiac function can occur if the disease is diagnosed early and further alcohol intake is reduced or halted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of dilated cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will discuss the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of alcoholic cardiomyopathy. The general and cardiovascular risks and benefits of alcohol consumption are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the risks and benefits of alcohol consumption&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-benefits-and-risks-of-moderate-alcohol-consumption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular benefits and risks of moderate alcohol consumption&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24111369\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alcoholic cardiomyopathy is a type of acquired dilated cardiomyopathy associated with long-term heavy alcohol consumption (commonly defined as &gt;80 g per day over a period of at least five years) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74268 \">table 1</a>). Like other types of dilated cardiomyopathy, alcoholic cardiomyopathy is characterized by a dilated left ventricle (LV), increased LV mass, and LV systolic dysfunction (generally detected as reduced LV ejection fraction). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24111241\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported prevalence of alcoholic cardiomyopathy among series of patients with heart failure or dilated cardiomyopathy has varied widely (eg, from 4 to 40 percent or more), depending upon the characteristics of the study population and the threshold alcohol consumption used to identify alcoholic cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of alcoholic cardiomyopathy appears to be similar among alcoholic men and women, with women developing the condition at a lower total dose of ethanol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In one series of 50 asymptomatic alcoholic women and 100 asymptomatic alcoholic men, approximately one-third of each group had evidence of left ventricle (LV) dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. LV systolic dysfunction correlated with the total lifetime dose of ethanol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, when patients were matched for LV ejection fraction, women consumed a lower total dose of ethanol adjusted for body weight compared with men. Thus, women appear to have increased sensitivity to cardiac toxicity; a similar predisposition has been identified for alcoholic liver disease and alcoholic myopathy. A proposed mechanism for this sex difference is excess accumulation of ethanol metabolites in women due to lower gastric metabolism of ethanol and higher rates of ethanol metabolism in the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease&quot;, section on 'Gastric metabolism of alcohol'</a>.)</p><p>There also appears to be a rough correlation between LV dysfunction and cirrhosis. In one series, cirrhosis was found in 43 percent of 30 alcoholics with cardiomyopathy compared with only 6 percent of 30 alcoholics without cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Fifty percent of 20 alcoholics with cirrhosis had evidence of dilated cardiomyopathy. Cardiac function was normal in a control group of patients with nonalcoholic cirrhosis. Of note, other studies have identified the separate condition of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy in patients with alcoholic or nonalcoholic cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"#H24113880\" class=\"local\">'Distinction from cirrhotic cardiomyopathy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24111678\"><span class=\"h2\">Relation to alcohol consumption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low to moderate levels of alcohol intake are associated with reduced total mortality and reduced cardiovascular risk, primarily the risks of coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke, although the mechanism of benefit has not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Epidemiologic studies suggest that beer and wine provide similar cardio-protective benefits provided they are taken in a non-bingeing fashion. Despite the potential cardiac benefits of alcoholic beverages, patients with the diagnoses of cardiomyopathy or cardiac arrhythmias should be advised to refrain from drinking altogether due to the unpredictable nature of the possible deleterious consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The limits of moderate alcohol intake are lower in women compared with men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In the United States, moderate drinking has been defined as up to one drink per day (not to exceed seven drinks per week) for women and up to two drinks per day for men (not to exceed 14 drinks per week); this is based upon 14 g ethanol (0.6 fl oz) per drink [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. With greater than moderate alcohol intake, the harmful effects of alcohol consumption outweigh the benefits, resulting in a J-shaped relationship between alcohol intake and survival (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82332\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82332 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the risks and benefits of alcohol consumption&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-benefits-and-risks-of-moderate-alcohol-consumption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular benefits and risks of moderate alcohol consumption&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The relationship between alcohol consumption and heart failure also appears to be J-shaped with reduced risk at low to moderate levels of alcohol intake as suggested by a meta-analysis including reports from the Framingham Heart Study and the Cardiovascular Health Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. As an example, a study of 14,729 participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study followed for a mean of 24 years found that men consuming up to seven drinks per week (14 g ethanol per drink) had reduced risk of heart failure compared with abstainers (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.94); this effect was less robust in women (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.0, p = 0.05) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>At higher levels of alcohol intake, LV dysfunction and alcoholic cardiomyopathy is related to both the mean daily alcohol intake and the duration of drinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. Alcohol intoxication can produce acute asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction even when ingested by healthy individuals in quantities typical of social drinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Even in non-alcohol-dependent subjects, habitual binge-drinking is associated with transient myocardial changes detectable by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), elevated serum markers for myocardial injury, changes in microindices of myocardial dysfunction, and coronary vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Most patients in whom alcoholic cardiomyopathy develops have been drinking more than 80 to 90 g of ethanol per day for more than five years (some studies quoted an average of 15 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/1,20-22,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20-22,26,27</a>]. This corresponds to approximately one liter of wine, eight standard sized beers, or one-half pint of hard liquor each day. The risk is based upon the absolute amount of ethanol, so consumption of a specific type of beverage (such as wine) is not protective.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H809910297\"><span class=\"h2\">Proposed mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of alcoholic cardiomyopathy is not fully understood. The toxic effect of acute alcohol binge on cardiac performance is transient, but chronic consumption may result in permanent impairment of myocardial contractility due to the effect of ethanol and its metabolites. The best-known toxic metabolite is acetaldehyde, a metabolite of alcohol produced in the liver by alcohol dehydrogenase. Acetaldehyde is thought to cause myocardial depression through an incompletely understood process that probably involves mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage, and impaired calcium ion homeostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/28-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease&quot;, section on 'Alcohol metabolism'</a>.)</p><p>There are several proposed mechanisms by which ethanol consumption may directly or indirectly (via metabolites) cause myocardial damage and cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ethanol exposure may cause oxidative stress within the myocardium either directly by stimulating the generation of free radicals or indirectly by activating other systems, such as the renin angiotensin system (RAS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/30,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,37</a>].

RAS activation may cause myocardial dysfunction via a number of the above mechanisms including oxidative stress, apoptosis, and adverse remodeling. A six-month study in dogs exposed to alcohol found that RAS activation contributed to progressive decrease in heart function. Administration of angiotensin receptor blocker <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irbesartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irbesartan</a> preserved myocardial contraction and relaxation (systolic and diastolic) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In humans, alcohol-induced hypertension, which is associated with RAS activation, may also contribute to the development of cardiomyopathy. Patients who have more than two drinks per day have a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in the incidence of hypertension compared with nondrinkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]; this effect is dose-related and is most prominent when intake exceeds five drinks per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-benefits-and-risks-of-moderate-alcohol-consumption#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular benefits and risks of moderate alcohol consumption&quot;, section on 'Hypertension'</a>.)</p><p>Genetic factors may predispose to alcoholic cardiomyopathy, though evidence is limited. As an example, DD polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene may predispose to alcoholic cardiomyopathy. This gene may manifest insertion (I) or deletion (D) polymorphism and therefore three genotypes (DD, II, and ID). Plasma and cardiac levels of ACE are 1.5- to 3-fold higher in patients with the DD compared with those with II genotype; they are intermediate in patients with ID genotype. In a study in which 30 alcoholic men with symptomatic cardiomyopathy were compared with 27 alcoholic men with normal cardiac function, the DD genotype was much more common in the men with cardiomyopathy (57 versus 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The odds ratio for developing LV dysfunction in alcoholics with the DD compared with the II or ID genotype was 16.4. The DD polymorphism has been linked to an increased risk of a number of cardiac disorders, including LV hypertrophy and progressive idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Actions of angiotensin II on the heart&quot;, section on 'ACE gene polymorphism'</a>.)</p><p>Although it was once thought that alcohol caused cardiomyopathy primarily through nutritional deficiencies, it is now clear that malnutrition is not a leading factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Even though beriberi heart disease has been classified as an alcoholic heart disease, it is distinct from alcoholic cardiomyopathy. In contrast to alcoholic cardiomyopathy, beriberi heart disease is rapidly reversible after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> therapy, manifests predominantly as right heart failure, is associated with increased cardiac output (high output failure), and exhibits normal myocardial histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and pathophysiology of high-output heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the above toxicities attributed to ethanol and its metabolites, additives to an alcoholic beverage (for example, cobalt added to beer) may exert a toxic effect on the myocardium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy#H2392034\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of dilated cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'Trace elements'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gross and microscopic findings in alcoholic cardiomyopathy are generally nonspecific and indistinguishable to those observed in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, though the latter condition may be associated with more marked histologic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. Findings include interstitial fibrosis, myocyte hypertrophy, and myocytolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>However, certain ultrastructural details may be suggestive of alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Alcohol, even in small amounts, may result in alterations of mitochondrial structure and function, and endomyocardial biopsy material from patients with chronic alcoholism exhibits structural alterations of the mitochondrial reticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In vitro animal studies show the cardiac ultrastructural changes after exposure to ethanol to be consistent and predictable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p>The progression of gradually developing structural changes is related to the stage of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The early stage is characterized by spatial reorganization of the mitochondrial reticulum; intermitochondrial junctions disappear and the mitochondria form separate clusters, uniformly distributed within a myocyte.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the second and third stages, destructive irreversible changes in the ultrastructural organization of mitochondria develop. Megamitochondria and septate mitochondria appear. A third compartment, containing granules, forms in mitochondria. Many lipofuscin granules appear due to the accumulation of lipids in mitochondria. Structural changes in the mitochondrial reticulum are considered a compensatory adaptation in response to altered myocardial function in alcohol cardiomyopathy.</p><p/><p>Changes in enzymatic activity in the myocardium have also been observed in both early and established alcoholic cardiomyopathy in humans and animal models. A decrease in the activity of the majority of oxidation-reduction mitochondrial enzymes, normal or increased activity of malate dehydrogenase, increased fatty acid uptake, and increased activity of lysosomal and microsomal enzymes are seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. However, these alterations in activity are nearly identical to those seen in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient with alcoholic cardiomyopathy presents with symptoms and physical findings like those in patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction or dilated cardiomyopathy of any etiology. In addition, symptoms and signs of unhealthy alcohol use may be observed.

Dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal disease are frequently observed. Palpitation and syncope due to tachyarrhythmias, usually supraventricular, are occasionally present. Angina pectoris is suggestive of concomitant coronary artery disease (or aortic stenosis), though up to one-third of patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy have chest pain that may resemble angina or be atypical.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1529549726\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical examination usually reveals signs of left and right heart failure including a narrow pulse pressure, often with an elevated diastolic systemic arterial pressure secondary to excessive peripheral vasoconstriction. Cardiomegaly (manifest as a displaced and enlarged apical impulse), protodiastolic (S3), and presystolic (S4) gallop sounds are common. An apical systolic murmur of mitral regurgitation, due to papillary muscle dysfunction, is often found. The severity of right heart failure varies, but jugular venous distention, ascites, and peripheral edema are common in advanced disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic mitral regurgitation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-heart-sounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of heart sounds&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Measurement of the jugular venous pressure may be an important distinguishing feature in determining whether ascites is due to alcoholic cardiomyopathy or cirrhosis. The jugular venous pressure is typically normal or low-normal in cirrhosis, unless there is tense ascites which, via upward pressure on the diaphragm, can increase the intrathoracic pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Thus, in the absence of tense ascites, an elevated jugular venous pressure is highly suggestive of at least a contribution from cardiac dysfunction. On the other hand, a low normal jugular venous pressure makes heart failure much less likely as the cause of ascites.

These include higher values for mean red cell corpuscular volume and hemoglobin, a mild thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum levels of gammaglutamyl transpeptidase and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). An AST to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio &gt;2 is highly suggestive of alcoholic liver disease.

The most common manifestation is paroxysmal atrial arrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation, but ventricular arrhythmias may also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/56-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-59</a>]. In a study comparing 94 patients with alcoholic cardiomyopathy with 188 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation was common in both groups (34 and 24 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Prolongation of the corrected QT interval on the surface electrocardiogram (QTc), a major risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias, is found in significant proportion of alcoholics compared with non-alcoholics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

Features of dilated cardiomyopathy are generally identified by echocardiography. If the echocardiogram is suboptimal, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) or computed tomography (CT) are alternative methods of assess cardiac chamber sizes and ventricular function. Coronary artery disease should be excluded. Endomyocardial biopsy is indicated when an alternative disorder requiring tissue confirmation is suspected.

Compared with normal control subjects, chronic alcoholics in one series had increases in the thickness of the LV wall (10.4 versus 8.8 mm) and interventricular septum (11.7 versus 9.6 mm) and in LV mass (145 versus 101 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m2)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. These abnormalities were present despite normal echocardiographic indices of myocardial contractility including ejection fraction, wall excursion, velocity, and circumferential fiber shortening. Systolic time intervals revealed shortening of ejection time and prolongation of the pre-ejection period.</p><p>It is frequently possible to demonstrate mild depression of cardiac function in chronic alcoholics even before a reduced ejection fraction becomes clinically manifest on the echocardiogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/22,69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,69,70</a>]. Diastolic dysfunction usually precedes systolic dysfunction and occurs more frequently once systolic impairment becomes apparent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. In addition, as noted above, LV function is impaired in many asymptomatic alcoholics or those with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In an echocardiographic study of 89 asymptomatic alcoholics and 30 healthy subjects, LV dilation was the initial manifestation of alcoholic cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. LV dilation was followed by an increase in the LV myocardial mass, posterior wall thickness, and diastolic interventricular wall thickness. The extent of diastolic dysfunction was related to the duration of heavy drinking, being most apparent in those with a duration of alcoholism for more than 16 years.</p><p>In another series utilizing 2D speckle tracking echocardiography involving 122 subjects, those who consumed moderate (&gt;90 to 150 mg ethanol daily, three to five <span class=\"nowrap\">days/week</span> for 9 to 20 years) and heavy (&gt;150 mg ethanol daily, six to seven <span class=\"nowrap\">days/week</span> for more than 10 years) alcohol displayed lower circumferential, longitudinal, and radial strain values (systolic) as well as early to late <span class=\"nowrap\">(E/A)</span> filling ratios (diastolic) compared with mild drinkers (&gt;90 mg ethanol daily, three to five <span class=\"nowrap\">days/week</span> for five to eight years) and non-drinkers. These changes show that moderate-to-heavy alcohol intake can cause subclinical depression of both systolic and diastolic function, and suggest that this echocardiographic technique may be useful in identifying drinkers with asymptomatic LV dysfunction who are at risk from developing alcoholic cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9767597\"><span class=\"h2\">Other cardiac imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If echocardiographic images are suboptimal for identification of features of dilated cardiomyopathy, other cardiac imaging to evaluate ventricular chamber sizes, wall thicknesses, and systolic function is suggested. CMR often provides superior image quality and definition compared with echocardiography, although there are no distinctive CMR features to differentiate alcoholic cardiomyopathy from other types of cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. An additional benefit of CMR is its utility in identifying characteristics suggestive of other specific causes of heart failure and cardiomyopathy such ischemic heart disease, amyloidosis, and iron overload. CT is another alternative to echocardiography which can combine coronary artery and ventricular imaging.
