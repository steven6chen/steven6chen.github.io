The digestive system includes all the structures and organs that handle and process food, such as the stomach and intestines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110678452\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of systemic scleroderma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms of systemic scleroderma include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A condition called &quot;Raynaud phenomenon,&quot; which causes the fingers and toes to turn white or purple-blue in response to cold or stress</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Puffy skin that slowly becomes hard and thicker than normal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joints that become stiff, because the skin around them isn't able to stretch as well as it used to</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small white lumps in or under the skin on the fingers &ndash; These are called &quot;skin deposits.&quot; They contain calcium and might also be called &quot;calcinosis.&quot;</p><p/><p>Less common symptoms that can happen when other organs are affected include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acid reflux &ndash; This is when the acid that is normally in your stomach backs up into your esophagus, the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble swallowing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110678467\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor or nurse might be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam. But you might need tests, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin biopsy &ndash; For this test, a doctor takes a small sample of your skin. Another doctor then looks at the skin cells under a microscope to check for signs of scleroderma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing tests, also called &quot;pulmonary function tests&quot; &ndash; These tests measure how well the lungs are working.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110678482\"><span class=\"h1\">How is systemic scleroderma treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments for systemic sclerosis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests every few weeks or months to check your blood pressure and check how well your kidneys and lungs are working</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prescription medicines to treat symptoms in different parts of the body</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove calcinosis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110678497\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can use special creams with &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lanolin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">lanolin</a>&quot; (a greasy substance found in wool) to help keep your skin moist. If itching is a problem, you can take over-the-counter antihistamines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">diphenhydramine</a> (sample brand name: Benadryl).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110678512\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have scleroderma, you might have a harder time getting pregnant than women without the disease. You also might be more likely to have a miscarriage. (Miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends before a woman has been pregnant for 20 weeks.)</p><p>During pregnancy, some of your symptoms (such as Raynaud phenomenon) might get better. But other symptoms (such as heartburn) might get worse. If you have kidney problems caused by scleroderma, pregnancy can be very dangerous and even life threatening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110678527\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because scleroderma affects the way you look and, in some cases, your ability to do everyday things, the disease can cause stress and worry. Your doctor can refer you to a counselor or a local scleroderma support group for advice on coping with the condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11259092\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=raynaud-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Raynaud disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in adults (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
