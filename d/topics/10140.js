The number of people who die from lung cancer each year has risen over the past 25 years and is greater than the number of people who die from breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer combined. Several factors increase the risk of lung cancer, but the most important risk factor is cigarette smoking.</p><p>This topic review discusses ways to prevent lung cancer and discusses the benefits and risks of screening for lung cancer. Other topics about lung cancer are available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-cancer-risks-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Lung cancer risks, symptoms, and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-small-cell-lung-cancer-treatment-stage-i-to-iii-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Non-small cell lung cancer treatment; stage I to III cancer (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-small-cell-lung-cancer-treatment-stage-iv-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Non-small cell lung cancer treatment; stage IV cancer (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=small-cell-lung-cancer-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Small cell lung cancer treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTING LUNG CANCER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cigarette smoking is responsible for almost 90 percent of cases of lung cancer. Exposure to certain substances, such as asbestos, has also been linked to the development of lung cancer. Exposure to secondhand smoke and other environmental factors such as radon also increase the risk of lung cancer.</p><p>The best way to avoid getting lung cancer is not to smoke. Some smokers believe that once they have smoked for a long while, it does little good to quit. However, studies have shown that smokers who quit decrease their risk of lung cancer when compared with those who continue to smoke. Smokers who quit for more than 15 years have an 80 to 90 percent reduction in their risk of lung cancer compared with people who continue to smoke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">IS SCREENING WORTHWHILE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening is a way to detect a disease in its earliest stages, before a person becomes ill. To be recommended, it must be clear that screening is useful in identifying patients who have the disease in the early stages, and that this discovery can reduce the number of patients who die from the disease.</p><p>Some screening exams have improved outcomes by detecting early cancer and reducing the risk of dying with early treatment. Some examples of these include screening tests for detection of cervical cancer in women and screening for colon cancer. These exams are now part of routine health care in the United States.</p><p>Screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography (CT) scan has been shown to decrease the risk of death for people over age 55 years who have a long history of smoking. However, screening is not as important as quitting smoking because quitting smoking will reduce your risks of other cancers and heart disease as well. Also, screening can lead to the need for additional testing in many people who do not have lung cancer and should not be done for people who are not in a high-risk group. If you have a serious medical condition such as chronic lung, heart, or other disease, the risks of lung cancer screening may outweigh the benefits for you. Also, if you are very concerned about the stress associated with having a &quot;false positive&quot; test (getting an abnormal result which is later found to not be cancer), or worried about other risks of screening, you should discuss your concerns with your clinician before starting screening. Your clinician can help you figure out if screening is a good choice for you (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110643\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110643 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">LUNG CANCER SCREENING EXAMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Research studies have been done to determine if screening for lung cancer makes sense. In these studies, smokers (who are at the highest risk) are divided into groups. Some groups have screening tests while others have no screening. The groups are then followed over many years. Data are gathered on how many patients in each group are diagnosed with lung cancer, how the cancer was treated, how many patients with cancer were treated, how long the patients with lung cancer survived after treatment, and how many patients died from the disease (mortality).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Low-dose CT scan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large randomized trial (the National Lung Screening Trial [NLST]) in the United States compared the benefits of screening by low-dose computed tomography (CT) scan or chest x-ray (also called &quot;chest radiograph&quot;) in smokers (at least a 30 pack-year history, including current smokers or people who had quit in the previous 15 years). Compared with chest x-ray, low-dose CT scan reduced the risk of death from lung cancer by 20 percent and the overall risk of death by about 7 percent. However, nearly a quarter of the patients who had yearly CT screening for three years had an abnormal test, and more than 95 percent of the abnormal tests were &quot;false positive,&quot; meaning that they did not represent cancer.</p><p>False-positive tests require follow-up tests, such as more radiology tests or, sometimes, biopsies, and these follow-up tests carry risks such as increasing radiation exposure and complications from biopsy procedures. Thus, there are important downsides to screening.</p><p>Yearly screening with low-dose CT scan is now recommended by many organizations for current or former smokers (who quit within the past 15 years) with a long smoking history. Guidelines vary among organizations regarding the specific criteria they use, including age and smoking history (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64078\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64078 \">table 2</a>). UpToDate authors suggest annual screening for patients in good health who are age 55 to 80 years, have a history of smoking at least 30 pack-years, and, if they are former smokers, quit smoking within the previous 15 years. They also note that patients who wish to avoid the high risk of false-positive results can reasonably choose not to be screened.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2689201\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest x-ray</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although many health care providers recommend an annual chest x-ray for patients who smoke, studies have not shown a benefit and we recommend against this practice. In a large study comparing chest x-ray with CT for lung cancer screening, only CT showed reduced risk of death. Current guidelines recommend against screening at-risk people by chest x-ray.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Sputum tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some studies have looked at the effect of analyzing a patient's sputum for evidence of cancer cells in order to detect lung cancer. So far, no benefit to this approach has been found. Additional studies that use new technologies to examine the sputum are underway.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">PET scan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Researchers are looking at a number of other tools in an effort to help identify patients with lung cancer. Positron emission tomography (or PET scanning, which uses a small amount of radioactivity to provide a detailed picture of an organ's function) has been used in combination with CT scanning <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET/CT)</span>. However, it involves a higher dose of radiation than CT alone, and benefit has not been shown for screening purposes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Other studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct visualization of the lungs with bronchoscopy and breath analysis or blood testing for cancer markers are tests that may be used in future studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who smoke are at significantly increased risk of developing lung cancer. The best way to avoid lung cancer is not to smoke. Even long-term smokers benefit from quitting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening with yearly low-dose computed tomography (CT) scan decreased mortality in a randomized trial of patients with increased risk due to smoking. However, many patients had abnormal tests that did not turn out to be lung cancer. Whether or not to be screened should be based on a discussion of risks and benefits with a health care provider. Screening annually with low-dose CT scan is suggested for patients who are at highest risk (age 55 to 80 years, a history of smoking at least 30 pack-years, and, if former smokers, have quit within the previous 15 years). If you choose to be screened, it is important to have this done in a center with expertise in lung cancer screening and treatment.
