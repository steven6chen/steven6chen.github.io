Most patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria have no adverse consequences and derive no benefit from antibiotic therapy. As a result, most episodes of asymptomatic bacteriuria are not detected since general screening is not recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with asymptomatic bacteriuria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Issues related to asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with diabetes mellitus will be reviewed here. Diabetic patients have an increased risk of certain symptomatic urinary tract infections such as acute cystitis, emphysematous infections, renal and perinephric abscess, and Candida infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emphysematous urinary tract infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-and-perinephric-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal and perinephric abscess&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Candida infections of the bladder and kidneys&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complicated urinary tract infection (including pyelonephritis) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The discussion in this topic refers only to non-pregnant women. Asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term asymptomatic bacteriuria refers to the presence of high quantities of an uropathogen in the urine of an asymptomatic person. Initial studies showed that colony counts &ge;10<sup>5</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/mL</span> more often predicted persistently high levels of bacteriuria compared with lower colony counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) on asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults and catheter-associated urinary tract infections recommend the following criteria for the diagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For asymptomatic women, bacteriuria is defined as two consecutive clean-catch voided urine specimens with isolation of the same bacterial strain in counts &ge;10<sup>5</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/mL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For asymptomatic men, bacteriuria is defined as a single, clean-catch, voided urine specimen with one bacterial species isolated in a quantitative count of 10<sup>5</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/mL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For any asymptomatic patient, bacteriuria is defined as a single catheterized urine specimen with one bacterial species isolated in counts &ge;10<sup>5</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/mL</span>. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since screening for the presence of microalbuminuria is recommended in diabetic patients, these routine evaluations often lead to the incidental discovery of asymptomatic bacteriuria. The overall approach to this generally benign disorder is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with asymptomatic bacteriuria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Concern about asymptomatic bacteriuria in diabetic patients derives in part from three observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a roughly five-fold greater propensity toward UTI in diabetic women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic bacteriuria often precedes symptomatic UTI in type 2 diabetes (relative risk [RR] 1.65, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] 1.02-2.67) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>UTIs are likely to be more severe in diabetic than nondiabetic women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>The best estimate is an approximately three- to fourfold increase in risk of bacteriuria in diabetic women (eg, 18 versus 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], 26 versus 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]). The incidence is even higher in diabetic patients with advanced or severe disease as determined by end-organ damage or elevated levels of glycosylated hemoglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A prospective cohort study of 218 diabetic and 799 nondiabetic postmenopausal women examined risk factors for asymptomatic bacteriuria and UTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Increased risk occurred mainly in women taking insulin (relative risk 3.7) and those with a longer diabetes duration (&gt;10 years, relative risk 2.6), but there was no association between asymptomatic bacteriuria and glucose control.</p><p>Genetic factors may also be involved. One Canadian study, for example, showed a higher rate of asymptomatic UTI in aboriginal diabetic women than in diabetic women of European heritage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATION WITH URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large cohort of diabetic women in the Netherlands was studied to determine the incidence of symptomatic UTIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In women with type 2 diabetes (but not with type 1), the presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria at baseline increased the risk of subsequent symptomatic UTI in the 18 month follow-up period from 19 to 34 percent. The rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria in this population was approximately 28 percent. By contrast, incidence of asymptomatic UTI was 6 percent in women who were not diabetic but attended other clinics in the same institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Even in this cohort of diabetic women, there were more symptomatic UTIs in the women who had negative baseline urine cultures than in those with positive ones. Thus, screening for later UTI risk would not be very cost effective even in this high-risk population.</p><p>A prospective study of 496 adult diabetics assessed the relationship between asymptomatic bacteriuria and subsequent hospitalization for urosepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria was 7.3 percent (14 percent females and 1 percent males). Twenty-nine patients were subsequently hospitalized with urosepsis. Asymptomatic bacteriuria was significantly associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for urosepsis (hazard ratio, 4.4; 95% CI 1.2-16.5). Further large scale studies are needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bacteriology of UTIs is similar in diabetic and nondiabetic women with the preponderance being caused by E. coli and other gram-negative organisms. However, as in the subgroups described above, antibiotic therapy for asymptomatic bacteriuria does not affect the frequency of or time to symptomatic infection (including pyelonephritis), reinfection is common, and long-term prognosis is not improved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women#H899949156\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women&quot;, section on 'Microbiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SHOULD YOU TREAT?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest <strong>not</strong> treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in women with diabetes mellitus, regardless of the presence of pyuria. This recommendation is based upon multiple studies which have shown that antibiotic therapy is associated with no reduction in symptomatic infection and a high rate of recurrent bacteriuria once antibiotics are discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>]. In addition, persistent asymptomatic bacteriuria is not associated with an adverse effect on renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>The best data come from a prospective trial in which 105 diabetic women over the age of 16 years with asymptomatic bacteriuria were randomly assigned to 14 days of antibiotics or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. At four weeks after the end of therapy, a significantly greater proportion of patients in the antibiotic group cleared the bacteriuria (80 versus 22 percent with placebo).</p><p>After this six week period, the group assignment was revealed, and patients were followed for a mean of 27 months; bacteriuria was assessed at three month intervals and patients who originally received antibiotics were treated during subsequent episodes. Patients were also evaluated for symptomatic UTI, pyelonephritis, and hospitalization for UTI. There were no significant differences between the groups in the development of a symptomatic UTI, the timing of onset of such an infection, or any of the other parameters. Patients in the antibiotic treatment group had nearly five times the number of days on antibiotics compared to the placebo group.</p><p>In a second report, 333 diabetic patients attending a clinic were screened for bacteriuria and followed for one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Forty-five of these patients were found to have bacteriuria; despite effective treatment, more than one-half had positive cultures within the year of the study. A similar study by the same authors tracked 45 diabetic women with bacteriuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Despite six weeks of therapy for women with positive tests for antibody-coated bacteria (suggestive of parenchymal infection), there was a high rate (80 percent) of recurrent bacteriuria during a follow-up of up to several years.</p><p>In addition, the presence of pyuria, which is a reflection of inflammation of the genitourinary tract and is frequently observed among patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria, is not an indication that antibiotics should be given. Pyuria is also common in diabetic patients with bacteriuria and does not have prognostic significance. As an example, the prevalence of pyuria in diabetic patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria is almost 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The presence or degree of pyuria has not been shown to be associated with an increased risk of symptomatic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>These data in women with diabetes mellitus are similar to those in other nonpregnant populations, which suggest that treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria has no clinical benefit, is associated with a higher rate of recurrent bacteriuria, and increases the risk of increased resistance in bacterial isolates that cause subsequent UTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].
