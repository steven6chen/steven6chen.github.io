It is typically diagnosed late in its course, and the median survival following diagnosis is approximately 6 to 20 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The mainstay of potentially curative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma is surgical resection, but several other treatment modalities may also have a role. In properly selected and prepared patients, hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma may be an option, even in patients with underlying cirrhosis. Patients with more advanced disease who undergo major hepatic resection have improved outcomes compared with those who are not candidates for other treatments because of disease extent, including transplantation. Resectable patients with early HCC and underlying liver disease are increasingly being considered for transplantation because of potential for better disease-free survival and resolution of underlying liver disease, though this approach is limited by organ availability, especially in resectable patients. </p><p>Options for surgical resection are in part determined by the severity of underlying liver disease, which is reflected by the Child-Pugh classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401 \">table 1</a>) or the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, which is a prospectively developed and validated chronic liver disease severity scoring system to predict survival (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-model-of-endstage-liver-disease-meld-score-not-for-liver-transplantation-listing-purposes-not-appropriate-for-patients-under-age-12-years\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>).

The suggested approach is useful for conceptualizing the various treatment options that are available for individual patients but may not be applicable in all settings. A discussion of these issues and an overview of available therapies for HCC are summarized elsewhere.

Furthermore, patients with chronic liver disease who undergo any form of therapy for HCC are at high risk for recurrent disease and progression to liver failure. It is important that patients with more advanced liver disease have proper monitoring and assessment of their underlying liver disease, which may have a major impact on longer-term survival. Prognostic scoring systems to assess the severity of underlying liver disease in patients undergoing treatment for HCC are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognostic factors in hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Staging and prognostic scoring systems'</a>.)</p><p>Establishment of a multidisciplinary HCC clinic has been associated with improved clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Comprehensive care of patients with cirrhosis includes antiviral therapy for HBV and HCV, immunization against hepatitis A and HBV (if indicated), and endoscopic screening and surveillance for varices.

The assessment of potential resectability of HCC focuses on two main issues: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The likelihood of the disease being confined to the liver (except fibrolamellar subtype of HCC). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fibrolamellar-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of fibrolamellar carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the size and location of the tumor relative to the patient's underlying liver function will permit resection without excess morbidity and mortality. </p><p/><p>Patients ideally suited for resection have localized HCC confined to the liver without radiographic evidence of invasion of the vasculature of the liver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54856\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54856 \">image 1</a>), preserved hepatic function, and no evidence of portal hypertension (although a minor resection could be considered in some patients with portal hypertension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Resection can provide benefits for some patients with multifocal disease or those with major vascular invasion, although outcomes are less favorable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognostic factors in hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Clinical implications'</a>.)</p><p>Only one-half of patients initially thought to be resectable and referred for surgery actually have resectable tumors. Among the reasons for unresectability are the extent of intrahepatic disease, extrahepatic extension, inadequate functional hepatic reserve, and involvement of the confluence of the portal or hepatic veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p>Despite even aggressive surgical approaches, most patients have disease (either HCC or underlying chronic liver disease) that is too extensive to permit treatment with &quot;curative&quot; intent. In high-incidence regions of the world, only 10 to 15 percent of newly diagnosed patients are candidates for standard resection, whereas in low-incidence areas, between 15 and 30 percent of patients have potentially resectable disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>] (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiologic associations of hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Determining the extent of tumor involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anatomic delineation of tumor extent is best achieved with dynamic multiphase computed tomography (CT), for which the nonenhanced, hepatic arterial phase is assessed separately from the portal venous phase and a late &quot;wash-out&quot; phase. Small HCCs are often isodense to the liver in the portal venous phase and may be missed on a conventional &quot;screening&quot; CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In contrast, arterial phase imaging detects 30 to 40 percent more tumor nodules than conventional CT and may be the only phase needed to demonstrate the tumor in 7 to 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. MRI appears to be as accurate, or more accurate, than CT in liver staging for HCC using both multiphasic and multiparametric imaging (combining T1, T2, and diffusion-weighted imaging with dynamic multiphasic imaging). Several studies have shown MRI to be superior to CT for detection of HCC, particularly in cirrhotic livers and particularly for correct diagnosis of smaller nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p>The role of other imaging studies in the evaluation of primary HCC, including positron emission tomography (PET) with conventional and novel agents and CT arteriography, is discussed in detail elsewhere. In general, these studies add little to thin-slice, multiphasic imaging except in highly selected cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p>Although characterized in few reports, the recognized sites of metastatic spread of HCC are lung, bone, peritoneum, and adrenals. Although these sites of disease may be demonstrated by standard imaging techniques, peritoneal disease is frequently missed. The rate of extrahepatic disease spread at diagnosis is overall low, and staging chest CT and bone scans do not provide additional information on metastases in patients who have localized HCC. The utility of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positive emission tomography (FDG-PET) scanning for detection of otherwise occult distant metastatic disease is uncertain and not recommended in guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p>However, the risk of extrahepatic metastatic disease is higher in patients with a tumor that is large (&gt;5 cm), is located at a subdiaphragmatic location, or demonstrates vascular invasion. Patients who have such tumors warrant additional imaging studies or diagnostic laparoscopy prior to resection, particularly if they have worrisome symptoms, such as bone pain. </p><p>There is no general rule regarding tumor location, size, or number in selecting patients with HCC for resection; however, most consider stage IIIB, IVA, and IVB disease to be incurable by resection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110835 \">table 2</a>). These stages are defined by invasion of a major portal or hepatic vein, direct invasion of organs other than the gallbladder, perforation of the visceral peritoneum, and nodal or distant metastases. However, hepatic resection for stages IIIB and IVA disease may be considered in a center of excellence because clinical benefits and long-term survival can be achieved in a properly selected, though admittedly small, minority of patients. </p><p>Advances in the surgical management of hepatocellular carcinoma have expanded the indications for curative hepatectomy, including more extensive liver resections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>The impact of size, multifocality, regional nodal involvement, and tumor rupture on resectability is debated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with small tumors are less likely to harbor occult vascular invasion and have a better outcome after surgery. Patients with a solitary HCC without vascular invasion have a similar survival regardless of tumor size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F59785\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59785 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/4,6,20-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,20-29</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although many surgeons restrict eligibility for resection to patients with tumors that are &le;5 cm in diameter, there is no general rule regarding tumor size for selection of patients for resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/6,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,30,31</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Outcomes for patients with large tumors were studied in a multi-institutional series of 300 patients undergoing resection for HCC &ge;10 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The five-year overall survival rate was 27 percent for all patients combined. In multivariate analysis, four clinical factors (serum alfa-fetoprotein [AFP] &ge;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> multiple tumor nodules, presence of major vascular invasion, and presence of severe fibrosis) were independent predictors of poor outcome. Five-year survival rates were significantly worse for patients with one or two, or three to four risk factors compared with those with none (19, 14, and 49 percent, respectively). However, these clinical factors were not reliable predictors of outcome. Fifty-six percent of patients with one or two risk factors and 20 percent of those with three or four risk factors had T1 or T2 disease on pathologic evaluation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In another multicenter retrospective review of 1115 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, major hepatectomy was performed in 539 patients, for which the mean tumor size was 10 cm (range 1 to 27 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The TNM Stage distribution was: 29 percent Stage I, 31 percent Stage II, 38 percent Stage III, and 2 percent Stage IV. Five-year survival rates improved for each successive cohort at 30 percent for 1981 to 1989, 40 percent for 1990 to 1999, and 51 percent for 2000 to 2008. Perioperative mortality also improved. In multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with worse outcomes included earlier time period, alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> tumor size &gt;5 cm, presence of major vascular invasion, presence of extrahepatic metastases, and positive surgical margins. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a prospective study of over 11,000 patients undergoing hepatectomy for HCC from 2002 to 2010 in Taiwan, patients with small (&lt;3 cm), medium (3 to 4.9 cm), large (5 to 10 cm), and huge (&gt;10 cm) tumors had five-year overall survival of 72, 62, 51, and 35 percent, and 10-year overall survival of 53, 42, 36, and &lt;20 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Known factors that are predictive of poor outcomes, such as inadequate margins of resection, poor differentiation, multiple tumors, vascular invasion, and cirrhosis, also applied to patients with huge HCC. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multifocality increases the T classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63333\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63333 \">table 3</a>) and is associated with lower survival but does not exclude a good outcome in selected patients. In several studies, resection of multifocal HCC was associated with five-year survival rates of approximately 24 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/21,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,33,34</a>]. Patients with multinodular HCC who appeared to benefit from resection were those with sufficient liver reserve to tolerate resection, without extrahepatic disease and without major vascular invasion. Size alone is not a contraindication for resection of multinodular HCC. Unfortunately, many patients have multifocal disease that is underestimated even by high-quality CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymph node metastases are uncommon overall (between 1 and 8 percent), but their presence portends a worse outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Preoperative detection of nodal metastases is limited by the frequent presence of benign nodal enlargement, most often involving the porta hepatis and portacaval space, in patients with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Highly suspicious nodes based on enhancement similar to the intrahepatic HCC lesions indicate the need for biopsy in a patient being considered for resection. Outcomes are worse in patients who have regional nodal involvement. Although practice is variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>], we consider that&nbsp;documented regional (portal) nodal involvement precludes potentially curative resection for hepatocellular carcinoma. However, lymph node involvement is <strong>not</strong> a contraindication to resection for patients with fibrolamellar HCC; these patients undergo a formal lymph node dissection. Prior to planned hepatic resection, exploratory laparoscopy and intraoperative ultrasound may help identify extrahepatic metastatic disease that precludes hepatic resection. (See <a href=\"#H1061867308\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative staging'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-resection-techniques#H93285701\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic resection techniques&quot;, section on 'Staging laparoscopy and use of ultrasound'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fibrolamellar-carcinoma#H140700697\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of fibrolamellar carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Potentially resectable disease'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 10 percent of HCCs spontaneously rupture. The clinical picture is that of acute abdominal pain and distension, hypotension, and a drop in the hematocrit.

If bleeding can be controlled with embolization, a formal staging evaluation should be undertaken, followed by laparoscopic exploration and a subsequent attempt at resection, if feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

After initial stabilization and clinical evaluation, 33 underwent hepatic resection. Although the median survival after hepatectomy was worse in ruptured compared with nonruptured cases (26 versus 49 months) and the rate of extrahepatic recurrence was higher (46 versus 26 percent), eight patients (24 percent) remained alive without recurrent disease after a median 45-month follow-up.</p><p/><p>For patients with liver-confined HCC who are not candidates for standard resection, alternative treatment modalities include interstitial therapies; transarterial chemoembolization (TACE); transarterial radioembolization (TARE, embolization with particles emitting radiation); localized ablative techniques involving either freezing or cryoablation; chemical desiccation (eg, ethanol or acetic acid ablation); or heating with laser, microwave, or radiofrequency ablation (RFA).

Four weeks after PVE, there was an overall 10 to 12 percent increase in liver volume that was independent of technique, and 85 percent of patients underwent planned laparotomy for attempted major hepatectomy. Reasons for not proceeding to surgery included inadequate hypertrophy of the remnant liver in 18, severe progression of liver metastases (n = 43), extrahepatic spread (n = 35), or other (refusal of surgery, poor medical condition, altered treatment approach for a variety of reasons, etc.; n = 35). Of the patients who underwent laparotomy, resection was not possible in 27, because of advanced, unresectable disease. Following resection, 23 patients had transient liver failure (2.5 percent) with 7 patients dying of acute liver failure (0.8 percent).</p><p>The benefit of PVE was further shown in a retrospective series that compared outcomes among patients who underwent major hepatic resection for HCC at a single institution with (n = 21) or without (n = 33) PVE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In the PVE group, the median standardized future liver remnant volume pre- and post-PVE was 23 and 34 percent, respectively. Patients who underwent PVE had fewer major complications (10 versus 36 percent) and no 90-day mortality (compared with 18 percent for major resection without PVE).

Although in the noncirrhotic liver up to two-thirds of functional parenchyma can be removed safely depending upon the age of the patient, for cirrhotic patients, the resection needs to remove the least amount of nonmalignant parenchyma possible to preserve postoperative liver function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F64800\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64800 \">picture 1</a>). Because the capacity for liver regeneration is impaired in cirrhotics, resection is generally limited to &lt;25 percent of the functional parenchyma. However, some patients maintain adequate functional hepatic reserve even after a hemihepatectomy, particularly if preoperative portal vein embolization (PVE) is used to induce compensatory hypertrophy in the future liver remnant (the region of liver that will remain after resection). (See <a href=\"#H1061867819\" class=\"local\">'Portal vein embolization'</a> above.)</p><p>One retrospective study compared anatomic versus nonanatomic resection for 658 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) without evidence of macroscopic vascular invasion who underwent primary resection with curative intent. The surgical procedure was selected by the surgeon based upon patient characteristics. There was no significant difference between the two groups in recurrence-free survival, overall survival, or early recurrence rate within two years after resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. However, the incidence of microvascular invasion was higher in the matched anatomical resection group. Future randomized trials are needed to directly compare the two techniques. Until further data are available, most surgeons recommend anatomic approaches when feasible and safe based on analysis of liver function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H882402433\"><span class=\"h2\">No touch technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some surgeons have advocated an anterior or &quot;no touch&quot; technique to resection of HCC. This approach utilizes initial transection of the liver parenchyma to the inferior vena cava (IVC) and ligation of the inflow and outflow vessels before mobilization of the hemiliver. The advocates of this technique hypothesize that separation of the hemiliver and the tumor from the IVC before mobilization reduces the risk of vessel rupture and theoretically minimizes the potential for tumor cell dissemination. A prospective trial of 120 patients (87 percent with underlying cirrhosis or hepatitis) directly compared this technique with conventional resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Compared with the conventional technique, the anterior approach was associated with less blood loss, lower transfusion requirements, significantly longer median overall survival (&gt;68 versus 23 months), and lower hospital mortality (1.7 versus 10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. However, recurrence and disease-free survival rates were similar between the two groups. The results of this study have been questioned because the rates of massive blood loss (28 percent) and perioperative mortality (10 percent) using the conventional approach for HCC resection were higher than usually reported, which may reflect the larger proportion of patients with cirrhosis or hepatitis in this series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. The liver can be lifted with a tape, providing a tremendous technical advantage when addressing large tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>], and many authors have found the technical advantage alone a reason to use the anterior approach (with hanging maneuver). Though data are lacking to conclude that the anterior approach is superior to conventional mobilization, the absence of a downside and significant technical advantage provided by anterior approach (particularly with the liver hanging maneuver) has led to widespread use of this technique in both open and minimally invasive liver surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H882402440\"><span class=\"h2\">Central hepatic resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical management of centrally located HCC (ie, those in segments IV, V, and VIII) is more problematic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81897\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81897 \">figure 2</a>). Extended right or left hemihepatectomy is the treatment of choice if potentially curative surgery can be undertaken safely. However, these resections can be associated with high morbidity and mortality rates due to insufficient residual functional liver parenchyma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/87-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">87-89</a>]. An alternative approach, mesohepatectomy (also called central hepatectomy), is used in which the central liver segments IV <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> V, and VIII (with or without segment I), are removed, leaving the lateral sectors intact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,91</a>].</p><p>Although randomized trials have not been conducted, the available data suggest that mesohepatectomy is a reasonable alternative to extended hepatic resection for centrally located tumors, giving acceptable oncologic outcomes with less parenchymal loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/90,92-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,92-95</a>]. However, in some centers, mesohepatectomy is seldom used, partly because it is a complex and technically demanding procedure that requires two hepatic resection planes and bilateral biliary reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. This could result in a higher risk of bleeding and postoperative bile leak as well as long-term biliary stricture and biliary dysfunction, although a retrospective study using propensity score matching demonstrated comparable morbidity and mortality rates after mesohepatectomy versus extended hepatic resection for malignant tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].

The available literature is steadily growing to fill the needed data gap regarding long-term oncologic outcomes. The available data support the view that, in experienced hands, laparoscopic resection is feasible and safe, but it is also highly technically demanding and should be undertaken only in high-volume centers with a program of graduated procedural complexity. One advantage of a laparoscopic approach may be simplification of subsequent liver transplantation, if ultimately needed, due to fewer abdominal adhesions after initial resection of HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].</p><p>The following represents the range of findings in patients undergoing laparoscopic resection for HCC: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review pooled the results from 15 mostly small, retrospective studies comparing open versus laparoscopic resection for solitary HCC (left lateral lobe, subcapsular right lobe) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. Almost all patients with cirrhosis were in Child-Pugh class A.

The 30-day perioperative mortality rate in modern series of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resection ranges widely from 1 to 24 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/19,20,22,114-118\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20,22,114-118</a>]. Consensus is growing that 30-day operative mortality is an inadequate indicator of risk, particularly of postoperative hepatic insufficiency and failure. Using an approach similar to liver transplantation reporting, 90-day mortality rates appear to be a more valuable indicator of outcome of liver resection, especially in the cases of extended resection and resection in patients with diseased livers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/119,120\" class=\"abstract_t\">119,120</a>].

The presence of cirrhosis is the most important predictor of postresection liver failure and death. Major resection in cirrhotic patients without careful selection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> portal vein embolization (PVE) continues to be a major challenge. Series assessing major resection in patients with cirrhosis without PVE continue to report mortality rates up to 18 percent compared with &lt;3 percent for those undergoing PVE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Evidence that transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) should be combined with PVE prior to major right resection is growing.

Laparoscopic liver resection for HCC in the hands of experienced surgeons is safe; however, larger studies with longer follow-up are required to adequately assess outcomes.
