Palliative care is an interdisciplinary approach to care that focuses on improving quality of life for patients and families facing serious illness. Palliative care has a role across the stages of heart failure, starting early in the course of illness, intensifying in end-stage disease, and extending into caregiver bereavement. </p><p>Advance care planning, symptom management, and psychosocial support as components of palliative care for patients with advanced heart failure will be reviewed here. Indications, estimation of prognosis, and strategies for palliative care in patients with advanced heart failure and general management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction are discussed separately.

The results of such discussions are typically recorded as an advance care directive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-care-planning-and-advance-directives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advance care planning and advance directives&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discussing-goals-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discussing goals of care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Given the somewhat unpredictable nature of heart failure, advance care planning should ideally begin early in the disease process. For patients with heart failure, advance care directives provide an avenue to express their wishes about a range of life-sustaining treatments, usually to withhold or withdraw, in the event of a terminal condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For providers of heart failure care, advance care directives can help ensure value-treatment concordant medical decision making, with improved quality of life and death. Patients tend to underestimate disease severity and may defer difficult discussions to the detriment of timely decision making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a longitudinal study of 608 United States heart failure patients, over half of the patients did not have an advance directive at the time of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A single-center study showed that involving a social worker who is charged with implementing the Serious Illness Care Program in the inpatient heart failure team increased the number of advance care directives and medical orders for life-sustaining preferences documented in the medical record and improved patient-provider prognostic concordance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p>Preparedness planning encourages earlier completion of advance care directives. Advance care directives have traditionally focused on end-of-life care, while preparedness planning focuses on preparing for any adverse event. The focus of preparedness planning is specific to the individual patient&rsquo;s situation, and it focuses on respecting patients&rsquo; beliefs and preferences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Preparedness planning has been shown to improve attitudes and increase completion of advance care directives in patients with heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The concept of preparedness planning is often combined with a palliative care visit as the first step to the ultimate completion of advance care directives. </p><p>Although creation of advance directives has sometimes been considered a one-time event, optimal advance care planning is iterative and is likely to evolve through the course of an undulating and progressive disease like heart failure. Choices regarding medical therapy made by patients with heart failure can and should change over time. As an example, a patient with progressive symptoms who initially requests all available therapy may later decide to forgo left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy and may later opt to avoid hospitalization while continuing to consent to less burdensome treatments. </p><p>A revisiting of advance care directives should occur at both regular intervals and major milestones or interventions (eg, prior to planned surgery). An &quot;annual heart failure review&quot; with the patient&rsquo;s primary heart failure provider has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) updated the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule in 2016 to establish a separate payment for two advance care planning services provided to Medicare beneficiaries by physicians and other practitioners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H124581480\"><span class=\"h3\">Approach to discussion leading to preparedness planning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following are key steps for patients and clinicians during conversations (both at an &quot;annual review&quot; or a revisiting of the issues around major milestones) that include preparedness planning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Characterize clinical status</strong>: Functional ability, symptom burden, mental status, quality of life, and recent disease trajectory.

However, situations of medical futility are relatively rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Major interventions should be presented with a balanced description of alternative approaches. Referral for specialty palliative care may be helpful for many of these difficult decisions.

They are not substitutes for conversations with health care providers but tools to help frame the discussions and inform patients of their options. Various forms of decision aids are available, including pamphlets, videos, interactive web-based platforms, and books that address common medical decisions in heart failure, including implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and LVAD implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. A systematic review of tools used to promote shared decision making in critically ill patients showed that the use of decision aids improved knowledge and awareness of treatment choices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4217911243\"><span class=\"h3\">Examples of complex treatment modalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decision support is particularly important for aiding shared decision making regarding complex treatment modalities such as use of ICDs and LVADs. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2117407685\"><span class=\"h4\">Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decisions on ICD implantation should be grounded in patients&rsquo; beliefs and wishes around end-of-life care. ICDs can prevent death from a lethal arrhythmia but do not improve cardiac function or reduce heart failure symptoms (unless cardiac resynchronization therapy with biventricular pacing is also indicated) and can add burden, particularly if the ICD discharges inappropriately. An ICD may also increase the likelihood of a prolonged death from pump failure or the risk of hospital admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The variable use of and perceptions of patients considering ICD therapy highlights the need for improved care and communication around this process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Discussion of key palliative care issues such as relief of suffering and quality of life may play an important role in clarifying expectations and patient beliefs around ICD therapy. Guided by palliative care principles, the 2013 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association guideline recommendation for implantation of an ICD recommends that a discussion occur with each patient about the risks, benefits, and alternatives of ICD therapy, and this discussion should be documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]; quality measures are based on documentation of an appropriate discussion rather than implantation.

Deciding whether to proceed with LVAD implantation involves a complex assessment of the severity of heart failure, comorbidities, frailty, caregiver burden, and lifestyle changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. For patients implanted with an LVAD as destination therapy, eventual death with the LVAD in place is expected from the time of implantation. Therefore, a discussion about discontinuing LVAD support should be part of the consent process prior to implantation. The 2013 International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines for mechanical circulatory support include a weak recommendation to consult palliative care; the society specifies that goals and preferences for end of life should be discussed as part of this consultation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Most patients describe at least one symptom as burdensome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Regardless of etiology, cardiac dysfunction tends to cause reduced cardiac output that then prompts retention of sodium and water, leading to congestion. Thus, symptoms associated with heart failure should be addressed foremost by controlling volume status, removing exacerbating factors, and optimizing therapies that improve cardiac performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/21,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,42,43</a>]. Symptoms generally are more severe with volume overload; however, they often persist in euvolemic states. In end-stage disease, when hypotension or renal dysfunction begin to dominate, reduction or withdrawal of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and beta blockade are often indicated; at the same time, providers should avoid abandoning potentially life-saving therapies too early and should recognize that permanent withdrawal heralds a transition to Stage D disease.

The basic principles, general evidence-based management strategies, and expected benefits of palliative care approaches to symptoms may aid the highly symptomatic and functionally limited heart failure population. Furthermore, heart failure rarely occurs in isolation, so that integrated approaches to care, which consider symptoms arising from multiple comorbidities, are applicable to most patients with heart failure. A palliative care specialist is not needed to prescribe many of the interventions; most primary care or cardiology clinicians, particularly with some training, can provide these services. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of managing common non-pain symptoms in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Comprehensive palliative approaches to symptom management in heart failure have been proposed although high-quality studies have shown mixed results. Systematic reviews of studies that were conducted in multiple countries that included patients with heart failure, as well as cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV, and multiple sclerosis have found that use of expert home palliative care teams improved symptom control, quality of life, and patient satisfaction, reduced health care utilization, and increased the odds of dying at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. However, the Collaborative Care to Alleviate Symptoms and Adjust to Illness in Chronic Heart Failure (CASA; NCT01739686) randomized trial found that an intervention to improve symptoms and quality of life by integrating palliative and psychosocial care into chronic care did not significantly improve patient outcomes over usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Generally, low doses of opioids are sufficient to achieve relief of dyspnea. In one study, about 40 percent of the patients responded to 10 mg oral morphine and about 20 percent responded to 20 or 30 mg oral morphine. As the response may increase over the first week of treatment, only cautious dose increases should occur within one week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Laxatives should be administered along with opioids to prevent constipation. Renal function is impaired in advanced heart failure, so <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a> may be preferred to morphine, as renally-excreted active metabolites of morphine can cause adverse effects.

Seventeen percent experienced ICD shocks, highlighting that tachyarrhythmias may limit continuation in some patients and discontinuation of ICD therapies should be considered in these patients. Conversion to hospice care may include discontinuation of inotropic support, consistent with goals of care and due to financial considerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].

Studies show that most patients with ICDs do not understand how they work or that there is an option to deactivate them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. Furthermore, providers rarely discuss ICD deactivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>]. The result is that ICDs remain active until (and often during) death; disturbingly, this even happens to patients in hospice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,101</a>]. </p><p>Turning off the defibrillator function should be presented as a simple step that may be consistent with the goal of preserving quality of life during the dying process. Except in the presence of recurrent ventricular tachycardia (ventricular tachycardia storm), deactivating ICD shock function does not cause any immediate noticeable change for the patient. The ICD shocking function is deactivated by reprogramming the device. A sample ICD deactivation policy including ethical rationale, process of informed consent, and process for deactivation has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. A palliative care consultation can help clarify the goals of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. A decision to deactivate any accompanying pacemaker function should be made separately, as this involves consideration of the indications for pacemaker therapy. Emergent deactivation to stop repeated shocks can be accomplished for most devices (depending upon the brand and model) by placing a magnet designed for pacemakers over the ICD. While the magnet is in place, the ICD will not sense and will not deliver antitachycardia pacing or shocks.

Although the legal construct of patient autonomy does not recognize different degrees of dependence on therapies to be withdrawn, individuals may have difficulty accepting discontinuation of therapy that leads to direct patient demise and some providers view it as an act of euthanasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Iterative discussions around device deactivation, starting before implantation, are essential to decrease confusion for providers, patients, and their families. Device deactivation can be done in the hospital or at home, attended by a device-trained individual and others as requested (hospice nurse, chaplain, etc). Discontinuation of power to valveless continuous-flow devices typically results in an immediate and marked reduction in systemic blood flow, with deaths occurring in less than 20 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. This clinical scenario has been likened to withdrawal of endotracheal intubation and ventilatory support, although patients on mechanical circulatory support are more likely to be fully awake and alert at the time of decision to discontinue support. Data are lacking on the best way to involve palliative care in the treatment of these patients, but an algorithm has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>] and palliative care specialists often play a key role at the time of deactivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3146299178\"><span class=\"h1\">CAREGIVER BURDEN AND SUPPORT FOR CAREGIVERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although most family and friends are appreciative of the opportunity to help their loved ones with heart failure, informal caregivers report schedule burden (ie, disruption of daily tasks), financial burden, and family burden.

Given the somewhat unpredictable nature of heart failure, advance care planning should ideally begin early in the disease process. (See <a href=\"#H3666799328\" class=\"local\">'Definitions and timing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discussion between patients and clinicians leading to preparedness planning should address clinical status, estimates of prognosis, patient values and beliefs, appropriate treatments, and anticipated treatment options. Preparedness planning includes documentation of advance care directives, resuscitation preferences, preferences for and location of end-of-life care, and surrogate decision-makers. (See <a href=\"#H124581480\" class=\"local\">'Approach to discussion leading to preparedness planning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with heart failure often face major treatment decisions over time and should be provided with support in thinking through the benefits and burdens of each treatment option. Decision support tools can be very helpful to help frame discussions and inform patients of their options but are not substitutes for conversations with health care providers. (See <a href=\"#H591281704\" class=\"local\">'Decision support'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decision support is particularly important for aiding shared decision making regarding complex treatment modalities such as use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and left ventricular assist devices. (See <a href=\"#H4217911243\" class=\"local\">'Examples of complex treatment modalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptom management is a key component of palliative care for patients with heart failure. Meticulous management of heart failure therapies is a critical component of symptom palliation. Palliative care approaches, including integration of therapies for multiple comorbidities, may ameliorate refractory heart failure symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and pain, although study results have been mixed. (See <a href=\"#H3852968651\" class=\"local\">'Symptom management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with heart failure are at high risk for depression but limited data are available to guide therapy in this clinical setting.

Management of the end of life for patients with heart failure includes addressing and re-addressing patient decisions about treatment (including intravenous inotropes, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, and mechanical circulatory support), and making decisions about the location of death, home services, and hospice care.
