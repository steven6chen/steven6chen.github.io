The disease course is highly variable but it is well recognized that there is an increased risk of morbidity and sudden cardiac death (SCD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-death-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden cardiac arrest and death in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In broad terms, the symptoms related to HCM can be categorized as those related to heart failure, chest pain, or arrhythmias. Patients with HCM have an increased incidence of both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias and are at an increased risk for SCD. Overall, age at death has a bimodal distribution with the highest frequencies in infancy and adolescence, and the poorest survival in patients with inborn errors of metabolism and malformation syndromes diagnosed before one year of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. HCM is the most common cause of SCD in young, athletic, seemingly healthy individuals, accounting for more than one-third of SCD cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The terms &quot;idiopathic&quot; and &quot;familial&quot; HCM are sometimes used to describe patients who phenotypically have HCM in whom genetic testing is negative or was not performed, in the absence of evidence for a syndrome or systemic disease (&quot;idiopathic HCM&quot;) or in the presence of a positive family history (&quot;familial HCM&quot;). The assumption is that such patients are genetically-determined with a yet undiscovered mutation or gene. Clinically, idiopathic and familial HCM follow the path of sarcomeric HCM.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HCM phenocopies</strong> &ndash; There are a number of HCM mimickers, or &quot;phenocopies,&quot; that present similarly to sarcomeric HCM but that have different pathophysiologies.

Importantly, medical treatments have not been shown to alter disease progression. Management strategies are focused on symptom improvement, with utilization of potentially life-saving therapy in the form of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) in patients deemed to be at high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3922205130\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles of medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General principles of medical management of HCM include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pharmacologic therapy</strong> &ndash; Medications used to treat HCM are aimed at reducing LVOT obstruction, decreasing myocardial oxygen demand, and slowing the heart rate to improve ventricular filling (ie, keeping the heart &quot;slow and full&quot; in an effort to reduce the effective LVOT gradient). Beta blockers are the most commonly used agents in children. (See <a href=\"#H2990123047\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-medical-therapy#H176433\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Medical therapy&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms of action'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoidance of volume depletion</strong> &ndash; In patients with HCM, volume depletion tends to decrease stroke volume and worsen the LVOT gradient (or induce an LVOT gradient if no gradient is present during euvolemia). Worsening of the LVOT gradient, particularly when volume depleted, can lead to hypotension, lightheadedness, and syncope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoidance of medications that may be harmful</strong> &ndash; Medications that can exacerbate the LVOT gradient should be avoided, including:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vasodilators &ndash; Vasodilators, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nifedipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amlodipine</a>), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nitroglycerin</a> can produce a fall in peripheral resistance with an increase in LVOT obstruction and filling pressures, thereby resulting in hypotension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> worsening heart failure (HF) symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diuretics &ndash; By reducing preload, diuretics can result in less LV filling, a smaller LV chamber, and therefore greater outflow obstruction. However, cautious use of diuretics may be attempted only in non-obstructed HCM patients with persistent HF and evidence of volume overload. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Digoxin</a> &ndash; Digoxin is generally avoided in HCM given that the function is hyperdynamic at baseline. One exception is in patients with systolic dysfunction, as seen in &quot;burned-out&quot; HCM. In this case, standard heart failure therapies may be indicated despite the recommendation to avoid them in patients with HCM and preserved LV systolic function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-in-children-management#H2734497137\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heart failure in children: Management&quot;, section on 'Digoxin'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2990123047\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Negative inotropic agents (most commonly beta blockers; less commonly, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers [eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">verapamil</a>] and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disopyramide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">disopyramide</a>) are the most widely used initial therapies in children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F111459\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef111459 \">algorithm 1</a>). There have been no large randomized trials of pharmacologic therapies in HCM. As a result, treatment strategies are based upon observational data and clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. An empiric approach is usually required, since it is not possible to predict which drug will work best for a given patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F111459\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef111459 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2852212529\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no standardized approach regarding when to initiate treatment for children with HCM and practice varies considerably. Pharmacologic therapy is generally indicated for patients with symptomatic HCM. However, LVOT obstruction resulting in symptoms with exertion is uncommon in children with HCM, often despite a high LVOT gradient. In addition, determining symptoms in younger patients may be difficult, as is determining the presence of a provocable LVOT gradient. In our practice, we treat all symptomatic patients, and we treat asymptomatic patients whose LVOT gradient is greater than mild (ie, &gt;25 mmHg at rest).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3613155027\"><span class=\"h3\">First-line agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our practice, we typically use beta blockers as a first-line therapy. The preference for beta blockers over other agents is based on the ease of dosing, greater experience and comfort with these agents, and the limitations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">verapamil</a> use in neonates and young infants (verapamil is generally avoided in infants &lt;12 months due to concerns for apnea, hypotension, and cardiac arrest). Many experts favor beta blockers over verapamil (particularly in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disopyramide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">disopyramide</a>) in patients with evidence of LVOT obstruction, due to the potential risks associated with the vasodilatory effects of non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and disopyramide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. </p><p>In a retrospective cohort study, high-dose beta blocker therapy was the only treatment found to be associated with improved survival in childhood HCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4097954960\"><span class=\"h3\">Second-line agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who are intolerant of beta blockers due to side effects, we typically attempt second-line monotherapy with a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">verapamil</a>) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disopyramide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">disopyramide</a>. Verapamil is generally avoided in infants &lt;12 months due to concerns for apnea, hypotension, and cardiac arrest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3095186862\"><span class=\"h3\">Combination therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who have significant symptoms and LVOT obstruction despite monotherapy, we proceed with combination therapy. Options for combination therapy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta blocker plus non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">verapamil</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta blocker plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disopyramide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">disopyramide</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">verapamil</a>) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disopyramide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">disopyramide</a> </p><p/><p>Beta blocker in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">verapamil</a> is our preferred combination therapy. However, this approach is frequently limited by symptomatic bradycardia, particularly in younger patients who are more dependent on calcium and less tolerant of bradycardia. Patients should be monitored for adverse effects, including bradycardia, hypotension, fatigue, decreased appetite, and feeding intolerance. Combinations using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disopyramide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">disopyramide</a> are not commonly encountered in pediatric patients and data are limited, but its use may be applicable in the older adolescent. There is generally no role for using three drugs (beta blockers, verapamil, and disopyramide) simultaneously. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3162878082\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent heart failure symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients have persistent heart failure symptoms (eg, dyspnea, fatigue, poor feeding, poor growth) despite maximal therapy with negative inotropes (ie, beta blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disopyramide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">disopyramide</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Therapeutic options in such patients include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cautious use of diuretics</strong> &ndash; Diuretics are relatively contraindicated in most patients with HCM due to the potential reduction in preload, which may exacerbate LVOT obstruction, resulting in worsening symptoms and hypotension. However, in patients <strong>without</strong> LVOT obstruction who have refractory heart failure symptoms and are volume overloaded, diuretics may be used cautiously and are often effective in low doses transiently or on an as-needed basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-in-children-management#H2034150376\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heart failure in children: Management&quot;, section on 'Diuretics'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nonpharmacologic therapies</strong> &ndash; For patients with refractory symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> persistent severe LVOT obstruction (ie, LVOT gradient &ge;50 mmHg) who are not adequately managed with maximal medical therapy, nonpharmacologic therapies aimed at relieving the LVOT obstruction may be considered, including:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Surgical myectomy</strong> &ndash; If pharmacotherapy is ineffective or not tolerated, and limiting heart failure symptoms persist in the setting of LVOT obstruction, surgical myectomy can be highly effective. In a study of 127 pediatric and young adult patients with HCM and LVOT obstruction who underwent transaortic septal myectomy, the procedure was found to be safe and effective, with a reduction in mean LVOT gradient from 89 to 6 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Overall survival was &gt;90 percent at 20 years, with a total of six patients undergoing repeat septal myectomy for recurrent symptoms. Despite this overall safety and effectiveness, it should be noted that myectomy in younger children is complicated by higher prevalence of inadequate relief of LVOT obstruction. Of the patients who needed re-operation for persistent LVOT obstruction, all were under the age of 14 at initial surgery. In patients with LV obstruction due to Noonan syndrome, a small study including 12 patients undergoing surgical myectomy demonstrated similar results to those undergoing myectomy for nonsyndromic HCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

However, there are some unique considerations in pediatric patients, including the longevity of the device and lead, the size of the patient relative to the device, and the increased physical activity, particularly in young children. In addition, many children with ICDs outlive their devices and leads, necessitating complex extraction and multiple replacement procedures. These issues need to be carefully considered when evaluating therapeutic options in children with HCM. The risks and benefits of each approach differ by age, size, and whether the patient has symptoms or other risk factors for SCD.

These guidelines are not intended for use in patients younger than 16 years old. Traditional risk factors of septal dimension &gt;3 cm, family history of SCD, personal history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, personal history of unexplained syncope, or lack of appropriate blood pressure response during exercise stress, as well as the newer risk factor of late gadolinium enhancement burden, generally can be applied to older adolescent patients. To account for smaller patients, rather than an absolute value for septal thickness, we use septal dimension z-score &gt;5 as a cut-off for consideration of ICD placement, which includes the patients identified by both studies discussed above.

Over a median follow-up of six years, ventricular tachyarrhythmias were successfully aborted by appropriate defibrillator interventions in 31 patents (13 percent). Device-related complications occurred in 60 patients (26 percent) at a rate of 1.8 percent per year. The most common complication was inappropriate shock, which occurred in 42 patients (18 percent) and was equally common in patients with ICDs placed for primary versus secondary prevention. Notably, of the 42 patients experiencing inappropriate shocks, 13 (31 percent) also had appropriate device interventions. Other complications included lead fracture, dislodgements, or insulation defect without inappropriate shock (n = 11); <span class=\"nowrap\">hematoma/thrombosis</span> (n = 2); pocket revision (n = 2); infection (n = 1); generator malfunction or replacement because of manufacturer's advisory or recall (n = 1); perforation of right atrium during lead extraction (n = 1).
