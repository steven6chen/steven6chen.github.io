CNC is most frequently associated with mutations in the protein kinase A type I-alpha regulatory subunit gene<em> </em>(<em>PRKAR1A</em>) and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Approximately 25 percent of cases occur sporadically, as a result of a de novo mutation. </p><p>CNC has been previously called NAME (<strong>n</strong>evi, <strong>a</strong>trial <strong>m</strong>yxoma, <strong>e</strong>phelides) and LAMB (<strong>l</strong>entigines, <strong>a</strong>trial <strong>m</strong>yxoma, <strong>b</strong>lue nevi) syndrome. It should not be confused with the Carney triad, which consists of paragangliomas, gastric stromal tumors, and pulmonary chondromas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carney-complex/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Given the significant variability in the clinical manifestations, even within a given family, careful clinical evaluation of first-degree family members is warranted in presumed &quot;sporadic&quot; cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carney-complex/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Familial transmission has been reported more frequently via the affected mother, suggesting a non-Mendelian inheritance or impaired male fertility of affected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carney-complex/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2568368106\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CNC is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with high penetrance but heterogeneous expression. Approximately one-quarter of cases may be due to de novo mutations. Two genetic loci have been linked to CNC. Inactivating mutations in the protein kinase A type I-alpha regulatory subunit<em> </em>(<em>PRKAR1A</em>) gene on chromosome 17q22-24 are found in the majority of CNC patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carney-complex/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A second locus on chromosome 2p16 is also associated with CNC (Carney complex type 2 [CNC2], MIM 605244); however, a specific gene has not been identified at this site, and there does not appear to be a distinct <span class=\"nowrap\">genotype/phenotype</span> correlation for CNC2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carney-complex/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2237191679\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H700064159\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3449493231\"><span class=\"h3\">Pigmented lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lentiginous skin pigmentation is the most readily identifiable sign of CNC and is found in 70 to 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carney-complex/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Lentigines are stable, well-demarcated, and small (typically &lt;5 mm) tan, brown, or black pigmented macules. In contrast with ephelides (freckles), which tend to be lighter in color and most prominent on the photo-exposed areas of the skin, lentigines may occur anywhere on the body and also on mucosal surfaces. Occasionally, dark to black lentigines have a so-called &quot;ink spot&quot; appearance, with the central pigmentation &quot;bleeding&quot; into the surrounding skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F112132\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112132 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carney-complex/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H4047542824\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2568368106\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lentiginous skin pigmentation is the most readily identifiable sign of CNC and is found in 70 to 80 percent of patients. Lentigines often have a periorificial distribution and may be found on the lid margin and lacrimal caruncle. Other distinctive skin lesions include dark &quot;ink spot&quot; lentigines, multiple blue nevi, especially histologically epithelioid blue nevi, and cutaneous myxomas. (See <a href=\"#H3449493231\" class=\"local\">'Pigmented lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic manifestations of CNC result from endocrine and nonendocrine tumors, including primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease, testicular large cell calcifying Sertoli tumors, growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas, thyroid adenomas and carcinomas, and ovarian cysts. Rare but highly characteristic nonendocrine tumors associated with CNC include cardiac myxomas, psammomatous melanotic schwannomas, breast ductal adenomas, and osteochondromyxomas.

The diagnosis is established&nbsp;in patients&nbsp;with two or more major clinical criteria and in patients in whom a&nbsp;pathogenetic variant&nbsp;is identified in&nbsp;<em>PRKAR1A</em>.
