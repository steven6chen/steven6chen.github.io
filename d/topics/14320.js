The pathogenesis and clinical implications of primary hypertension in women are generally similar to those in men, but there are some differences.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before age 50 years, women have a lower prevalence of hypertension than men, but after age 55 years, they have a higher prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-essential-hypertension-in-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The eventual prevalence of hypertension in women is similar to that in men, averaging 30 to 40 percent in blacks and roughly 20 percent in whites. The prevalence rises with age, approaching 80 to 90 percent in women over the age of 70 years if subjects with isolated systolic hypertension are included (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F66935\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66935 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-essential-hypertension-in-women/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-prevalence-and-control-of-hypertension-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The prevalence and control of hypertension in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are, however, several important gender-related differences:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of hypertensive complications is significantly lower in women than in men, particularly in premenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-essential-hypertension-in-women/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The decrease in risk is primarily due to a reduced incidence of coronary heart disease (which is only one-half that in men at the same blood pressure), while the difference in the risk of stroke is much less prominent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-essential-hypertension-in-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is less common in women than in men with similar degrees of hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-essential-hypertension-in-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A greater blood pressure load seems to be required to produce cardiovascular injury in women. This difference is taken into account in a report from New Zealand that recommends that therapy be given only to those patients with an estimated overall 10-year risk for cardiovascular complications of at least 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-essential-hypertension-in-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. At equal degrees of hypertension, women were at lower risk than men in all age groups from 40 to 70 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63561\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63561 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p>The reasons for these differences are not clear, but hypertensive women have somewhat different hemodynamic findings from men (matched for blood pressure, race, age, and body surface area) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-essential-hypertension-in-women/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Women tend to have a 10 percent higher cardiac output and a 10 percent lower systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Women also then to have a wider pulse pressure, related to shorter stature (resulting in a more rapid return of the pulse wave to augment the peak pressure), and a faster heart rate (induces a short diastolic period) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-essential-hypertension-in-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Women also have only two-thirds as great a rise in blood pressure with exercise. Premenopausal women have less effective baroreflex buffering of blood pressure than men of similar age, which may explain less effective blood pressure regulation in women in response to vasoactive drugs and acute stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-essential-hypertension-in-women/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>It is possible that the lower SVR in some way minimizes vascular injury, thereby decreasing the incidence of coronary disease, heart failure, and stroke. The pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the hemodynamic differences are not known, but estrogens may play an important role.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of hypertension is related to a variety of factors that include genetic predisposition and lifestyle and dietary factors, such as high salt and alcohol intake and obesity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Risk factors for primary (essential) hypertension'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diet-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diet in the treatment and prevention of hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While most of these risk factors are similar in men and women, only women carry the additional risk marker of gestational hypertension. Hypertension in pregnancy may be an independent risk factor for subsequent diagnoses of hypertension and stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-essential-hypertension-in-women/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The importance of controlling risk factors to reduce the incidence of primary hypertension (formerly called &quot;essential&quot; hypertension) in women was evaluated in a prospective cohort study of 83,882 adult women from the second Nurses' Health Study who did not have a history of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-essential-hypertension-in-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Six lifestyle and dietary factors were independently associated with a lower risk of developing hypertension during 14 years of follow-up:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body mass index of less than 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A daily mean of 30 minutes of vigorous exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adherence to the DASH diet, modest alcohol intake</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infrequent use of nonnarcotic analgesics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Folate intake of 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> or more</p><p/><p>The presence of all six factors was associated with a marked decrease in the risk for developing hypertension (hazard ratio of 0.22, 95% CI, 0.10-0.51).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women and men respond similarly to antihypertensive therapy. In elderly women with isolated systolic hypertension, for example, the benefit from antihypertensive therapy is equal to that of men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-essential-hypertension-in-women/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypertension-in-older-adults-particularly-isolated-systolic-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypertension in older adults, particularly isolated systolic hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Women also derive substantial cardiovascular protection from antihypertensive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-essential-hypertension-in-women/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. A meta-analysis of seven major antihypertensive drug trials found that the relative benefit in women was similar to that in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-essential-hypertension-in-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, the absolute benefit was less in women because of the lower number of events if untreated and the distribution of benefit was different in women and men. Antihypertensive therapy reduced both coronary and cerebrovascular events in men compared to primarily a reduction in stroke in women.</p><p>The indications for drug treatment, the choice of drug therapy, and the goal blood pressure in hypertensive women are the same as in hypertensive men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-essential-hypertension-in-women/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>].

This is discussed separately.
