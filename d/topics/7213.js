Fractures of the first metacarpal (ie, thumb metacarpal) comprise a substantial portion of these fractures.</p><p>The presentation, diagnosis, and management of first (thumb) metacarpal fractures is reviewed here. Other injuries of the thumb and surrounding tissues are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-thumb-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with thumb pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scaphoid-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scaphoid fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulnar-collateral-ligament-injury-gamekeepers-or-skiers-thumb\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ulnar collateral ligament injury (gamekeeper's or skier's thumb)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-metacarpal-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of metacarpal fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3524111239\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metacarpal fractures are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-thumb-metacarpal-fractures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. They account for 30 to 40 percent of all hand fractures. First metacarpal (thumb) fractures make up almost 25 percent of all metacarpal fractures, placing them second only to fifth metacarpal neck (ie, &quot;boxers&quot;) fractures in terms of frequency. Of the fractures of the first metacarpal, over 80 percent involve the base. </p><p>Thumb fractures overall occur most commonly in children under age 16 and adults over age 65, but thumb metacarpal fractures occur most often among younger males (10 to 29 years old) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-thumb-metacarpal-fractures/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. They are commonly caused by falls and direct trauma secondary to sports, bicycle accidents, and from punching solid objects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-thumb-metacarpal-fractures/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-thumb-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with thumb pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY AND FRACTURE CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The thumb is distinct from the other fingers anatomically and biomechanically, and of critical importance to hand function. Accordingly, fractures to the thumb are considered separately from other metacarpal fractures, and must be managed with great care (see <a href=\"#H2870630211\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below). Thumb anatomy is discussed in greater detail separately, but aspects of particular relevance to thumb metacarpal fractures is discussed here (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finger-and-thumb-anatomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Finger and thumb anatomy&quot;</a>).</p><p>The thumb is highly mobile and lacks an adjacent phalanx on the radial side, both of which make it more susceptible to injury. The first metacarpal is shorter and wider than the four lesser metacarpals, and is not tethered by ligaments to an adjacent metacarpal on either side. Because of these features and the mechanisms commonly involved in injury (eg, axial load on partially flexed digit), the majority of first metacarpal thumb fractures occur at the base. First metacarpal fractures involving the base are prone to displacement due to the opposing forces of the abductor pollicis longus and the volar oblique ligament. These forces cause a common fracture pattern: type I first metacarpal fracture (or Bennett fracture), which is described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2480184716\"><span class=\"h2\">Metacarpal base fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fractures of the base of the thumb metacarpal are classified into four injury patterns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57258\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57258 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-thumb-metacarpal-fractures/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Types I and II are intraarticular fractures and types III and IV are extraarticular. Discerning whether the articular surface is involved in the fracture is critical as this dictates management.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I injury (&quot;Bennett fracture&quot;) is a fracture-dislocation or fracture-subluxation of the base of the metacarpal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F59041\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59041 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72289\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72289 \">image 2C</a>). In this injury, a smaller proximal fragment is held in anatomic position and maintains its attachment to the trapezium via the volar (or anterior) oblique ligament. The remainder of the larger metacarpal is displaced in a dorsal-radial manner, primarily by the abductor pollicis longus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-thumb-metacarpal-fractures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II injuries (&quot;Rolando fracture&quot;) can be thought of as a comminuted version of a Bennett fracture, in which the fragments may form a T or Y pattern at the base of the metacarpal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67033\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67033 \">image 1</a>). Severe comminution may occur and the classic Y or T pattern is not present. Type II fractures are quite difficult to treat but fortunately are rare.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type III fractures are (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50297%7EEM%2F63101\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50297 graphicRef63101 \">image 2A-B</a>) extraarticular and either transverse or less commonly, oblique.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type IV fractures are extraarticular pediatric injuries involving the proximal physis. These are generally Salter-Harris type II fractures. Nondisplaced Salter-Harris type II fractures are managed with protective immobilization, typically for four to six weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2935538774\"><span class=\"h2\">Metacarpal shaft, neck, and head fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fractures of the mid and distal first metacarpal shaft, neck, and head are relatively uncommon. Metacarpal head fractures are, by definition, intraarticular and are referred for surgical evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgical referral'</a> below.)</p><p>Fractures of the mid portion of the first metacarpal shaft and of the metacarpal neck are treated similarly to non-thumb metacarpal fractures. Metacarpal shaft fractures typically are transverse or oblique. Due to the deforming forces of the intrinsic musculature and the absence of stabilizing intermetacarpal ligaments, these fractures can displace and shorten. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First metacarpal fractures typically occur when a partially flexed thumb sustains a forceful axial load (ie, &quot;jamming&quot; the thumb). Typical mechanisms causing such an axial load include falls (often during sports), bicycle accidents (particularly a fall while gripping the handle bars), and fist fights where the flexed and abducted thumb strikes a hard object (skull, face, wall, etc). </p><p>A less common mechanism of first metacarpal fractures involves hyperabduction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hyperflexion during a fall. An oblique fracture may be sustained if the mechanism involves torsion (eg, someone grabs and twists the thumb, or the thumb is caught in machinery). Transverse fractures of the first metacarpal shaft are less common but typically result from a direct blow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS AND EXAMINATION FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with first metacarpal fractures typically present following direct trauma to the thumb complaining of pain, dorsal swelling over the base of the metacarpal, and diminished motion at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and carpometacarpal joints. It is important to distinguish tenderness at the base of the first metacarpal from tenderness at the scaphoid, trapezium, or distal radius, suggesting injury at those sites. In addition, if pain, swelling, or ecchymosis occurs more distally at the MCP joint (particularly on the ulnar side), care should be taken to assess the ulnar collateral ligament for signs of injury (&quot;gamekeeper's thumb&quot;). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulnar-collateral-ligament-injury-gamekeepers-or-skiers-thumb\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ulnar collateral ligament injury (gamekeeper's or skier's thumb)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2371791307\"><span class=\"h2\">Plain radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain radiographs remain the most common imaging technique for diagnosing first metacarpal fractures. Three views of the thumb are indicated to assess potential fractures of the thumb metacarpal. In addition to lateral and oblique views, a true anteroposterior AP (Robert view) should be taken. This view, taken in maximum pronation, provides good visualization of the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint. A true lateral (Bett view) revealing a Bennett fracture-dislocation can be obtained with the palm on the cassette, and the hand then pronated 15 to 20 degrees and the tube angled proximally 15 degrees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-thumb-metacarpal-fractures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Close inspection of an apparent extraarticular fracture is required to ensure that no portion of the fracture line involves the joint surface (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72289%7EEM%2F50297%7EEM%2F63101\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72289 graphicRef50297 graphicRef63101 \">image 2A-C</a>). An oblique extraarticular injury can be confused with a Bennett fracture. Computed tomography scanning is helpful at times, particularly with impaction injuries and to define the CMC joint and fracture fragment position in intraarticular injuries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3156246863\"><span class=\"h2\">Musculoskeletal ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Musculoskeletal ultrasound is a useful tool for screening and making a preliminary diagnosis of metacarpal fracture. However, plain radiographs remain the standard imaging technique for follow-up imaging once a preliminary diagnosis is made, and these should be obtained with all higher risk fractures (eg, joint involvement) or if there is any concern for fracture displacement.</p><p>Several small observational studies report that ultrasound demonstrates good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of metacarpal fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-thumb-metacarpal-fractures/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In these studies, sensitivity ranged from 91 to 92 percent, while specificity ranged from 87 to 98 percent, using plain radiographs as the standard.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3056178274\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definitive diagnosis of a first metacarpal fracture is made by diagnostic imaging, typically a plain radiograph. Some clinicians use ultrasound to screen for fracture and make a preliminary diagnosis. A history of direct trauma to the thumb and findings of dorsal swelling over the base of the thumb metacarpal, accompanied by diminished motion at the metacarpophalangeal and carpometacarpal joints, suggest the presence of a fracture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1892305341\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for acute thumb pain stemming from trauma is reviewed in detail separately.

Such injuries are uncommon.</p><p>All intraarticular first metacarpal fractures warrant referral to an orthopedic or hand surgeon. Because the integrity of the carpometacarpal joint is crucial to hand function, meticulous maintenance of the joint surface is required and most intraarticular fractures require surgical fixation.

Extraarticular fractures with &gt;30 degrees of angulation require reduction (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Closed reduction'</a> below). Definitive treatment for extraarticular fractures is thumb spica cast (with IP joint free) for four to six weeks.</p><p>Patients should be made aware that significant swelling or overly aggressive icing to this radial side of the thumb can cause a temporary palsy to the superficial radial nerve resulting in numbness over the dorsum of the thumb.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135690534\"><span class=\"h3\">Pediatric first metacarpal fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pediatric fractures of the first metacarpal fall into one of four fracture patterns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F115651\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115651 \">figure 3</a>), three of which involve the physis (ie, Salter-Harris fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54582\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54582 \">figure 4</a>)).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metacarpal shaft fracture</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salter-Harris type II fracture with medial (ulnar) &quot;metaphyseal flag&quot; (or fragment) &ndash; This pattern is most common</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salter-Harris type II fracture with lateral (radial) &quot;metaphyseal flag&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salter-Harris type III fracture</p><p/><p>These fractures should be evaluated for displacement and malrotation.

Reduction of thumb metacarpal fractures is typically performed by an orthopedic surgeon. However, if reduction is indicated and the treating clinician is comfortable with the procedure, or if there is no referral option available, reduction of extraarticular first metacarpal fractures can be performed in the following manner:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anesthesia is generally readily achieved via hematoma block. Placement of a hematoma block for metacarpal fractures is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metacarpal-shaft-fractures#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metacarpal shaft fractures&quot;, section on 'Anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once adequate anesthesia is confirmed, apply gentle longitudinal traction to the distal fragment while applying pressure over the apex of the fracture and extending the IP joint. Mild pronation of the distal fragment may also help to achieve anatomic alignment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70853\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70853 \">figure 5</a>). The fracture should then be immobilized with a thumb spica cast and post-reduction radiographs should be obtained to confirm alignment.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nondisplaced fractures and those fractures with good initial reduction should be seen and reimaged in 7 to 10 days. Patients with oblique fractures or questionable reduction require reimaging within three to five days. If follow-up films reveal angulation greater than 30 degrees, repeat reduction or referral is indicated.</p><p>Fractures that retain a stable position at follow up should be placed in a short arm thumb spica cast or a custom orthosis with the wrist in 30 degrees of extension and the interphalangeal joint free. Radiographs should be repeated at two-week intervals and immobilization should be continued for a total of four to six weeks.</p><p>Following immobilization, the patient should begin performing active range of motion exercises. Total healing time is six to eight weeks. Occupational therapy can be employed as needed to help patients regain motion and strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-thumb-metacarpal-fractures/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">RETURN TO WORK OR SPORT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients whose work requires repetitive or forceful gripping can expect to return to regular duty once they are pain-free, the fracture site is nontender, and functional range of motion has been regained. If the patient desires return to contact sport, the thumb should be protected in a club-type pad or a firm thumb-spica orthosis, typically for an additional six to eight weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4133650594\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p>With precise reduction of displaced fractures, good fracture care, and early mobilization, the risk of complications from first metacarpal fractures can be minimized. Nevertheless, even with proper care, complications, including those described below, can occur. A more detailed discussion of fracture complications is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Early and late complications&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Osteoarthritis</strong> &ndash; Osteoarthritis (OA), particularly at the first carpometacarpal (CMC) joint, is a relatively common chronic complication of first metacarpal fractures, particularly intraarticular fractures involving the base of the thumb. Achieving precise congruency of any fracture involving the joint is the best way to maintain joint function and decrease the risk for OA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hand-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hand osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stiffness</strong> &ndash; Stiffness at the CMC joint and the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint is a common complication of immobilization, particularly prolonged immobilization. Stiffness is more common in older individuals and can be mitigated by avoiding unnecessarily prolonged immobilization and initiating early mobility exercises (and possibly formal occupational therapy when indicated).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Weakness</strong> &ndash; Grip weakness may persist after a first metacarpal fracture, particularly those involving the base. Functional rehabilitation is often helpful for regaining strength.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Superficial radial nerve palsy</strong> &ndash; Injury to the superficial radial nerve can develop due to compression from a cast or splint on the nerve where it courses over the dorsoradial aspect of the distal forearm or thumb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-thumb-metacarpal-fractures/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. The palsy manifests as pain, paresthesias, or numbness over the dorsoradial aspect of the wrist and hand; there is no motor component. Ulnar flexion of the wrist with the forearm pronated exacerbates any discomfort. Typically conservative management including activity modification and local glucocorticoid injection is adequate. However, in rare cases, decompression may be necessary and referral to a hand surgeon is prudent in cases with persistent symptoms despite conservative care. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Malrotation</strong> &ndash; Malrotation is less common in thumb fractures than in fractures of the lesser four digits. However, attention to rotational alignment is imperative for all metacarpal fractures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Recurrent subluxation</strong> &ndash; Fracture malunion increases the propensity for chronic CMC joint subluxation. These cases present with persistent pain, stiffness, and intermittent episodes of instability at the first CMC joint. Radiographs may show subluxation. Referral to hand surgeon is warranted in suspected cases of recurrent subluxation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First (thumb) metacarpal fractures are relatively common. Most involve the base of the metacarpal. They occur primarily in younger males (10 to 29 years old). (See <a href=\"#H3524111239\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First metacarpal fractures typically occur when a partially flexed thumb sustains a forceful axial load (ie, &quot;jamming&quot; the thumb). Typical mechanisms causing such an axial load include falls (often during sports), bicycle accidents, and fist fights where the flexed and abducted thumb strikes a hard object. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with first metacarpal fractures typically present following direct trauma to the thumb complaining of pain, dorsal swelling over the base of the metacarpal, and diminished motion at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and carpometacarpal (CMC) joints. It is important to distinguish tenderness at the base of the first metacarpal from tenderness at the scaphoid, trapezium, or distal radius, suggesting injury at those sites. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms and examination findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain radiographs remain the most common imaging technique for diagnosing first metacarpal fractures, and are used for the surveillance of higher risk injuries. Musculoskeletal ultrasound is a useful screening tool for making the initial diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The thumb is integral to normal function of the hand. Due to the unique anatomy and biomechanics of the thumb, first metacarpal fractures are described and managed differently than other metacarpal fractures. The classification scheme for thumb metacarpal base fractures (including Bennett and Rolando fractures) is described above. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical anatomy and fracture classification'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finger-and-thumb-anatomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Finger and thumb anatomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis for first metacarpal fracture includes fracture of the scaphoid, dislocation of the first MCP joint, and thumb ulnar collateral ligament injury, among others. (See <a href=\"#H1892305341\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thumb metacarpal fractures are divided into two large groups: intraarticular and extraarticular. Intraarticular fractures require orthopedic referral and generally need surgical fixation. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgical referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extraarticular fractures are typically managed in a closed fashion with thumb-spica immobilization and rarely require surgery. Extraarticular fractures do not require perfect anatomic reduction and can tolerate up to 30 degrees of angulation. Nevertheless, some extraarticular fractures warrant surgical referral and the criteria for referral are described in the text. Basic fracture reduction technique is described in the text. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgical referral'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Closed reduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oblique extraarticular fractures should be carefully differentiated from Bennett fractures, are prone to displacement, and need to be observed closely (particularly during the initial two weeks). First metacarpal fractures in children may involve the physis and should be carefully assessed for malrotation (which is uncommon). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H135690534\" class=\"local\">'Pediatric first metacarpal fractures'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-thumb-metacarpal-fractures/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ashkenaze DM, Ruby LK.
