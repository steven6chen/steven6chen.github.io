The direct effect of electrical current, conversion of electrical to thermal energy, and blunt mechanical trauma can result in tissue destruction and organ dysfunction. Appropriate therapy includes management of trauma and a detailed physical assessment. Multiple surgical interventions, including fasciotomy and skin grafting, and prolonged supportive care may be required.</p><p>Electrical injuries will be reviewed here. The evaluation and management of burns, general aspects of trauma management, and injuries related to electrosurgery are discussed separately.

Up to 40 percent of serious electrical injuries are fatal, resulting in an estimated 1000 deaths per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>There is a bimodal distribution of environmental electrical injuries with respect to age. Work-related injuries in adults, and accidents in children, account for most electrical injuries. Incidence is increased among children younger than six years, often because of contact with electric cords or outlets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]; older children generally suffer high-voltage injuries from power lines while climbing trees or utility poles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>The incidence of electrical injuries decreases through the teenage years and increases again as adults enter the workplace. Together, construction and electrical workers account for about two-thirds of all electrical injuries. Electrical injuries are the second leading cause of occupation-related deaths in the United States. There is an approximately 2:1 male to female ratio in childhood; among adults, more than 90 percent of victims are men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/1,5,6,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6,10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Lightning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lightning injuries, a small subset of electrical injuries, are responsible for an average of 300 injuries and 100 deaths per year in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/3,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12-14</a>]. It is likely that lightning-related fatalities and hospitalizations are underestimated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Approximately 30 percent of those struck by lightning die and up to 74 percent of survivors may have permanent disabilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/4,12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12,16</a>]. Two-thirds of lightning-associated deaths occur within one hour of injury and are generally due to a fatal arrhythmia or respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>There is significant temporal variation in lightning-related fatalities; over 90 percent occur during the spring and summer, and roughly 70 percent occur during the afternoon and early evening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19</a>]. More than one-half of all lightning-related fatalities occur while people are engaged in outdoor recreational activities; another 25 percent happen when working outdoors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19</a>].</p><p>The victims of most fatal lightning injuries are young men. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), between 1980 and 1996, 85 percent of 1318 people reported killed by lightning were male, and 68 percent were aged 15 to 44 years. The greatest number of deaths attributable to lightning occurred in Florida and Texas, but New Mexico, Arizona, Arkansas, and Mississippi had the highest incidence (9 to 10 per 10,000,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrical weapons</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrical weapons, including the stun gun and the Taser, have been developed for use by law enforcement and security personnel to provide less lethal alternatives to conventional weapons, including handguns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These devices deliver bursts of high-voltage, low-amperage direct current, either through a handheld device (stun gun) or through a hook and wire system fired using compressed gas (Taser) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Electrical weapons are widely available and have been used for criminal purposes and torture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>A systematic review of the clinical studies of electrical weapons found no evidence that they cause &quot;dangerous laboratory abnormalities, physiologic changes, or immediate or delayed cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias&quot; when exposure lasts 15 seconds or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Subsequent reviews and studies have reported similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. A study of electrical weapons use against minors (n = 100; median age 16 years) reported no significant injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. We agree with the authors of two systematic reviews, who conclude that prolonged observation and diagnostic testing are <strong>not</strong> necessary in patients who are otherwise asymptomatic and alert following such an exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, in rare instances, fatal arrhythmias have been reported in patients shot by electrical weapons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. One report noted fatal cardiac arrest in 3 of 218 people who received medical attention within 5 to 25 minutes following Taser injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This study likely overestimates the risk of cardiac arrest, since only those individuals who required medical attention were included in the analysis. Concurrent intoxication with cocaine, methamphetamine, phencyclidine (PCP) or other stimulants is common among those subdued by law enforcement with electrical weapons and may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia, as may preexisting cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/21,23,26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23,26,28</a>].

Significant injuries reported in association with electrical weapons are rare, but may include cutaneous burns, lacerations, rhabdomyolysis, testicular torsion, ocular injury, and miscarriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/21,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,29</a>]. Evaluation of the trauma patient is discussed separately; the management of cutaneous injuries is supportive and is similar to the treatment of other types of electrical injuries.

The electrical current is the volume (or actual number) of electrons that flow between these points per second, measured in amperes. In an alternating current (AC), the direction of flow of electrons changes on a cyclical basis. Standard household current is AC alternating at 60 cycles per second. With direct current (DC), the direction of flow remains constant. DC current is found in batteries, railway tracks, automobile electrical systems, and lightning.</p><p>The force that drives the electrons across the potential difference is the voltage (V). Resistance (R) describes the hindrance to flow. The interrelationship among current (I), voltage, and resistance is described by Ohm's law:</p><p>I &#160;= &#160;<span class=\"nowrap\">V/R</span></p><p>Stated another way, current is directly proportional to the voltage and inversely proportional to resistance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injuries due to electricity occur by three mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct effect of electrical current on body tissues</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conversion of electrical energy to thermal energy, resulting in deep and superficial burns</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blunt mechanical injury from lightning strike, muscle contraction, or as a complication of a fall after electrocution</p><p/><p>The primary determinant of injury is the amount of current flowing through the body. Clinically, contact with a 120 V circuit carrying a 1 milliampere (mA) current is imperceptible to most persons, 3 mA leads to mild tingling, and 10 to 12 mA leads to pain. One hundred mA directed across the heart can cause ventricular fibrillation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75610\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75610 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. In addition, the voltage, resistance, type of current (AC or DC), the current pathway, and duration of contact all influence the extent of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>The tissue damage inflicted by most electrical currents can be primarily attributed to the thermal energy (or heat) generated by the current, as predicted by Joule's law:</p><p> &#160;Heat = current (I) x voltage (V) x time of contact (t)</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;= I x V x t<br/> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;= I x (I x R) x t (from Ohm's Law)<br/> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;= I<sup>2</sup> x R x t</p></div></div><p>Resistance is a function of the area of contact, pressure applied, and the presence of moisture. Tissues with higher resistance have a tendency to heat up and coagulate, rather than transmit current. Skin, bone, and fat have high resistances, while nerves and blood vessels have lower resistances.</p><p>Of all organ systems, the skin has the greatest effect on the severity of an electrical injury. Dry skin has a resistance of approximately 100,000 ohms; however, this drops to less than 2500 ohms when the skin is dampened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus, in some cases, a lower voltage applied to tissue with low resistance can generate more current and be more damaging than higher voltage applied to tissue with high resistance.</p><p>DC current tends to cause a single muscle spasm that throws the victim from the source. This results in a shorter duration of exposure, but a higher likelihood of associated trauma. In contrast, AC repetitively stimulates muscle contraction. Often, the site of exposure is at the hand, and because the flexors of the arm are stronger than the extensors, the victim may actually grasp the source, prolonging the duration of contact and perpetuating tissue injury.</p><p>The amount of AC needed to cause injury varies in proportion to its frequency, expressed in cycles per second or hertz (Hz). Skeletal muscle can become tetanic with frequencies between 15 and 150 Hz, and although a 20 mA current may not be perceptible at 10 Hz, the same current may cause respiratory paralysis or ventricular fibrillation at lower frequencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/9,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,34,35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As voltage is often the only variable known with certainty, electrical injuries are generally classified as being high voltage (&gt;1000 V) or low voltage (&lt;1000 V) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77842\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77842 \">table 2</a>). Voltage in high-tension power lines is greater than 100,000 V, while the typical voltage delivered to homes is either 110 V (North America) or 220 V (Europe and Asia). In contrast, lightning strikes are associated with a potential difference between the atmosphere and the ground in excess of 10 million volts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Clinically, there are four classes of electrical injury:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic injury pattern develops when the body becomes part of a circuit and is usually associated with entrance and exit wounds. These wounds generally do not help predict the path of the current, and the skin findings can significantly <strong>underestimate</strong> the degree of internal thermal injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flash (or arc) burns occur when the current arc strikes the skin, but does not enter the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flame injuries from clothing catching fire in the presence of an electrical source. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lightning injury is caused by a DC current exposure that lasts from <span class=\"nowrap\">1/10</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">1/1000</span> of a second, but often has voltages that exceed 10 million V [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/4,9,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,36</a>]. Peak temperature within a bolt of lightning rises within milliseconds to 30,000 Kelvin (five times hotter than the sun), generating a shock wave of up to 20 atmospheres induced by the rapid heating of the surrounding air [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/9,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,36,37</a>]. This shock wave then can be transmitted through the body and result in mechanical trauma.</p><p/><p>Because of the variability of tissue resistance, surface area, and volume of tissue exposed, it is extremely difficult to predict the actual course of current flow and to infer the type and extent of injuries to internal organs. Careful clinical assessment, recognizing that surface findings may underestimate the extent of tissue damage or necrosis, should be used to guide management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ORGAN INVOLVEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of electrical injuries range from mild superficial skin burns to severe multiorgan dysfunction and death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall estimate of arrhythmia following electrical injury is approximately 15 percent; most of these are benign and occur within the first few hours of hospital admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. However, acute electrical cardiac injury can result in sudden cardiac arrest due to asystole (usually with DC current or lightning) or ventricular fibrillation (AC current) prior to hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Ventricular fibrillation is the most common fatal arrhythmia, occurring in up to 60 percent of patients in whom the electrical current pathway travels from one hand to the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/3,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,41</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults&quot;, section on 'Ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia'</a>.)</p><p>Spontaneous return of sinus rhythm has been noted after asystole in cases of electrical injury, but because respiratory paralysis lasts longer, the rhythm may degenerate to ventricular fibrillation due to hypoxia. Atrial dysrhythmias, first and second-degree heart block, and bundle branch blocks have been noted as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/3,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,39</a>]. It is postulated that the anterior location of the right coronary artery leaves the sinus and AV nodal arteries more vulnerable. Changes in the ST segment and T wave, as well as conduction disturbances, generally resolve without specific treatment.

Cardiac contusion is the most common pathologic cardiac finding, while myocardial infarction is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Sensory and motor findings due to peripheral nerve damage are common. Unless the patient attempts to ambulate, lower-extremity weakness may go undiagnosed initially. Of note, the deficits may be &quot;patchy&quot; with the sensory deficits not corresponding to the motor findings. The clinical manifestations of neurologic damage from high-voltage exposures may be delayed for days to months after the injury.</p><p>Keraunoparalysis is a temporary paralysis specific to lightning injuries that is characterized by blue, mottled, and pulseless extremities (lower more commonly than upper).

Burns are most common at the site of electrical contact and at places in contact with the ground at the time of injury. The degree of external injury <strong>cannot</strong> be used to determine the extent of internal damage, especially with low-voltage injuries. Seemingly minor surface burns may coexist with massive muscle coagulation and necrosis, as well as internal organ injury. Patients with cranial burns or leg burns from lightning are at higher risk for death than others struck by lightning, possibly because more current has passed directly through the body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>A unique type of burn seen with electrical injury is the &quot;kissing burn&quot;. This occurs at flexor creases, where the flexor surfaces adjacent to a joint touch.</p><p>Oral burns can occur in young children from sucking or chewing on extension cords. Delayed hemorrhage from the labial artery may occur when the eschar separates, sometimes days after the injury. Cosmetic defects may also occur, particularly when the commissure is involved.</p><p>The incidence of superficial surface burns is high in victims of lightning injury, but deep burns are unusual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. One series of patients following lightning strike noted an 89 percent incidence of burns, but only 5 percent were deep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The low incidence of deep burns is in part due to the short duration of contact and the &quot;flashover effect&quot;, which occurs when the current travels on the skin surface and is discharged to the ground. This can result in the formation of branching cutaneous &quot;feather&quot; lesions, also called Lichtenberg figures, which fade rapidly but are pathognomonic of lightning injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69684\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69684 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Musculoskeletal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because bone has the highest resistance of any body tissue, it generates the greatest amount of heat when exposed to an electrical current.

(See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Cardiopulmonary resuscitation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trauma evaluation and appropriate resuscitation, beginning with a rapid assessment of the airway and cardiopulmonary status, should be performed for any patient with a severe electrical exposure. Cervical spine immobilization and assessment is necessary. Coma or neurologic deficit, including alterations in mental status, should prompt brain and spine imaging. A careful secondary survey is needed once the initial resuscitation is complete. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Trauma resuscitation and neurologic evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The survivor of a high-energy (&gt;1000 V) injury should have cardiac and hemodynamic monitoring due to the high incidence of arrhythmia and autonomic dysfunction, especially if there have been arrhythmias in the field or emergency department, loss of consciousness, or if the initial ECG is abnormal. In most cases, telemetry is adequate. Patients with signs of instability (eg, recurrent arrhythmia or hypotension) require more intensive monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with significant electrical injuries should be monitored for the development of acute compartment syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, and acute kidney injury. Such patients often require aggressive IV fluid replacement, especially if there are signs of muscle necrosis; those with lightning injuries typically require less volume than patients with thermal burns. The approach to fluid resuscitation is similar to that used for the prevention of kidney injury from heme pigments (ie, myoglobinuria) and is discussed separately. Fluid resuscitation for patients with severe electrical injuries is comparable to that used for major crush injuries. Given the risk of hyperkalemia, IV fluids containing potassium should be avoided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury#H25398978\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a> and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Fluid resuscitation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Myoglobinuria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin wounds from electrical injuries are treated in a similar manner to flame or other thermal burns. Importantly, Parkland and similar formulas used for fluid resuscitation following thermal burns should <strong>not</strong> be applied to electrical injuries, since surface burns may grossly underestimate the extent of injury. (See <a href=\"#H871295\" class=\"local\">'Skin wounds'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrical weapons do not cause cardiac arrhythmias or other dangerous injuries when used appropriately by law enforcement officers and exposure lasts 15 seconds or less. Prolonged observation and diagnostic testing are <strong>not</strong> necessary in such patients who are otherwise asymptomatic and alert following the exposure. The disposition of patients with an electrical exposure is discussed in the text.
