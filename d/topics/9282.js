Body packing was first described in the medical literature in 1973 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]; however, anecdotal reports suggest the practice was utilized by drug traffickers at least a decade prior to recognition. Body stuffing, which involves ingestion of drugs to avoid imminent apprehension by authorities, is a separate but related practice that can lead to acute life-threatening toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>When body packers present to health care providers, it is typically for one (or more) of the following reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient (&ldquo;body packer&rdquo;) is asymptomatic but is in the custody of authorities.

It is difficult to estimate the number of body packers who attempt to cross into the United States or other countries. Between 1993 and 2005, 1250 confirmed body packers were apprehended at New York's John F Kennedy International Airport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]; however, in the months after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there was a 60 percent increase in the number of body packer arrests, although it is not clear if this is due to increased trafficking, increased surveillance, or a combination of both factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The internal concealment of drugs of abuse resulted in at least 50 deaths in the greater New York City area between 1990 and 2001, most of which were related to acute toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Initially, body packers were predominantly young males, but subsequently reports document pregnant women and children performing this role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Cocaine and heroin are the drugs most often involved in body packing, but methamphetamine, hashish, ecstasy (methylenedioxymethamphetamine), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a> are also smuggled in this manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>].</p><p>Whereas many patients in early reports suffered drug toxicity from poorly packaged drugs, modern data suggest that leakage is uncommon and that most patients can be managed conservatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Bowel obstruction occurred in only three percent of patients in the more recent study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83249577\"><span class=\"h1\">METHODS OF BODY PACKING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The internal concealment of drugs of abuse requires a packing method that allows ingestion or insertion and retrieval of intact packets at some remote time. Primitive wrapping methods, such as duct tape, condoms, or plastics bags tied at one end [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], had a high rate of failure and have largely been replaced by a more sophisticated method involving several layers of latex and an outer wax coating (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73477\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73477 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51090\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51090 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/3,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,18</a>]. Each of these packets contains approximately 8 to 10 g of drug. Body packers (also pejoratively called &quot;mules&quot; or &quot;swallowers&quot;) generally ingest between 50 to 100 drug containers prior to departure, but larger numbers are reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Occasionally, smaller numbers of packets are inserted rectally or vaginally. In addition, attempts to avoid detection can involve alteration of the form of the drug. As an example, liquid cocaine has been used in body packets, making them more difficult to identify on radiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. </p><p>After ingestion, antimotility drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenoxylate-and-atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenoxylate-atropine</a>) are used to slow intestinal motility. Once they arrive at their destination, body packers often use promotility drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-hydroxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium hydroxide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium citrate</a>) to promote packet expulsion and retrieval.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1688070\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many cases, body packers are identified by law enforcement officials and referred to clinicians for evaluation, management, and packet recovery. However, a substantial number of patients present to physicians with symptoms either related to intestinal obstruction or drug toxicity. Both complications are potentially fatal if the underlying diagnosis is not recognized clinically. </p><p>The diagnosis of body packing is established based upon a suggestive history, findings on the physical examination, and diagnostic imaging, usually a plain radiograph of the abdomen. An approach to diagnosis and further management of these patients is outlined in the attached table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55939\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55939 \">table 1</a>). The clinical manifestations of opioid (eg, heroin) and cocaine toxicity are described in detail separately.

Multiple motives could cause them to over-report the package number (to stay in the hospital) or under-report the number (to deliver a drug packet in the prison system).</p><p>A thorough physical examination should be performed, with a focus on the following issues:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical evidence of body packing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Packets may be felt on abdominal, vaginal, or rectal examination, and provide clear evidence of body packing prior to diagnostic imaging.

The attached table summarizes the findings associated with common toxic syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71268 \">table 2</a>). The opioid toxic syndrome (such as occurs with heroin) consists of a depressed mental status, decreased respirations, miotic pupils, and decreased bowel sounds. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Opioid toxicity'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute opioid intoxication in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The sympathomimetic toxic syndrome (resulting from cocaine or <span class=\"nowrap\">amphetamine/amphetamine</span> analogues) consists of agitation, hypertension, tachycardia, mydriatic pupils, and diaphoresis. Cocaine or amphetamine toxicity in a patient with a large intestinal burden of drug is life-threatening and requires immediate intervention. Patients with more severe toxicity from a ruptured cocaine or amphetamine packet present with seizures, hyperthermia myocardial ischemia, heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, or coma. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Sympathomimetic (cocaine or amphetamine) toxicity'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-acute-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine: Acute intoxication&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-amphetamine-and-synthetic-cathinone-bath-salt-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute amphetamine and synthetic cathinone (&quot;bath salt&quot;) intoxication&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methamphetamine-acute-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methamphetamine: Acute intoxication&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Intestinal obstruction or perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/2,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21,22</a>] and perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>] occur more commonly than gastric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] or esophageal obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>] or perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], but all have been reported. Abdominal distention, tenderness, and abnormal bowel sounds (which may be high-pitched, tinkling, or absent) all suggest bowel obstruction; peritoneal signs suggest bowel perforation.

More advanced imaging studies (abdominal computed tomography [CT] or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> enhanced radiography) are indicated when a screening examination is negative in a patient in whom there is high suspicion of internal concealment. Abdominal CT or barium enhanced radiography are used more commonly following a known ingestion to guide surgical intervention and document clearance of all packets. CT, which can be performed without water-soluble contrast, is preferable if perforation is suspected. Liquid cocaine (and presumably the liquid form of other drugs) is more difficult to detect radiographically given its aqueous base and therefore radiographic appearance similar to tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

There are several signs on the plain abdominal radiograph that suggest body packing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeating geometric patterns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59243\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59243 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78845\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78845 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65449\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65449 \">image 3</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A rim of air trapped between two condoms, making the drug packets stand out in relief (the &quot;double condom sign&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59782\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59782 \">image 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]&nbsp;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Air in the tied ends of condoms (the &quot;rosette sign&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/22,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,29</a>] </p><p/><p>Pooled data suggests that the sensitivity of a single abdominal film is 85 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, the true sensitivity is difficult to assess and may be lower, as a substantial number of drug packets are not visualized on plain films [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/2,21,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21,30-32</a>]. As an example, in a retrospective study radiologists provided with clinical information about each case could not reach agreement on the presence or absence of packets on a plain abdominal radiograph in 14 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(41/279)</span> of studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. False positive studies can also occur in the setting of bladder stones, hardened stool (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78827%7EPULM%2F57853\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78827 graphicRef57853 \">image 5A-B</a>), or intraabdominal calcifications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57452\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57452 \">image 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only a few studies describe the use of ultrasound to screen potential body packers, but these reports suggest that this technology has a diagnostic accuracy similar to plain radiography. In two small, blinded studies, ultrasound correctly identified the subjects with a positive abdominal radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Another blinded study of 50 body packers compared ultrasound to traditional methods of screening (abdominal radiography or monitored stools) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Ultrasound had a diagnostic accuracy of 94 percent and required only 5 to 10 minutes to perform. However, because of the high pretest probability among these subjects, all of whom had been retained by officials due to suspicion of body packing, the true accuracy of ultrasound remains undefined. False negative results have been reported when packets were in the rectum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. While a positive ultrasound is likely sufficient to confirm a suspicion of body packing, a negative study should never be used to exclude the diagnosis, especially when a small number of packets are suspected. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Advanced abdominal imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advanced radiographic imaging (barium-enhanced abdominal radiography or contrast-enhanced abdominal computerized tomography [CT]) is indicated in one of two circumstances. Infrequently, it is used to diagnose body packing in whom the initial screening study (plain radiography) is negative, but in whom the index of suspicion is high. More often, these studies are used to exclude obstruction or confirm clearance of the gastrointestinal tract after treatment. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Indications and approach to radiographic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p>CT and barium-enhanced radiography are both more sensitive than plain abdominal radiographs for detecting drug packets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/30,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,38,39</a>]. In addition, 3-dimensional CT scans, which are increasingly available, provide detailed views of the abdominal contents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Packets on CT may appear as foreign bodies surrounded by a rim of gas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70495\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70495 \">image 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50541\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50541 \">image 8</a>). Packets on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> radiography generally appear as filling defects. &#160;</p><p>While most case reports and series confirm the utility of CT as a screening tool, at least two reports demonstrate that CT is limited for determining the exact number of packets ingested and finding single packets may remain after decontamination or a period of observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. </p><p>The results of one preliminary study suggest that the abdominal CT scout views have a high sensitivity for detecting drug packets, use a lower dose of radiation than plain films, and can be followed with a full CT if enhanced imaging is necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. While CT scanning offers some logistical disadvantages, this study offers a potential new perspective on screening. &#160;</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a radiation-free assessment of the abdomen. Although its diagnostic performance as a screening tool is undefined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], preliminary studies are encouraging with 100 percent sensitivity and 75 percent specificity reported in a study of 16 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Concerns exist regarding the limited availability of MRI machines and the time required to perform a study. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine drug testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of urinalysis in the detection of body packers is controversial. Sensitivities in larger studies have ranged from &gt;90 percent to &lt;40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The disparate sensitivities of published trials lead us to believe that urinalysis should <strong>not</strong> be used as a screening test for potential body packers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Law enforcement field testing of the actual packet content, which provides an accurate drug profile in minutes, is the ideal test to determine packet content. In the event that such testing is unavailable, urinary toxicology testing may be an acceptable surrogate. In several reports, findings on urine toxicology tests have correlated well with the subsequently identified packet contents. </p><p>However, negative urine toxicology tests in documented body packers are common. Furthermore, such testing may be misleading. As an example, in one case report the urine specimen from a cocaine body packer tested negative for cocaine but positive for opiates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. However, once body packing is confirmed, an initial negative urine screen that subsequently turns positive is highly suggestive of packet leakage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once gastrointestinal drug smuggling is identified, specific treatment depends upon the drug involved, as well as the presenting symptoms and signs. Determining when to perform a study to confirm gastrointestinal clearance following decontamination is difficult. As a first step, the packet count can be used. In most patients, a confirmatory study should be performed after the passage of three packet-free stools. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are asymptomatic should be managed expectantly, without surgery, with close monitoring in an intensive care setting until the passage of all packets is complete. This approach is supported by a number of large case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/10,17,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17,46,47</a>].</p><p>We suggest that treatment with whole bowel irrigation (WBI) be started with a polyethylene <span class=\"nowrap\">glycol/electrolyte</span> lavage solution (PEG-ELS) such as GoLytely, at a rate of 2 L per hour. In practice, it is difficult for a patient to consume PEG-ELS voluntarily at a rate of 2 L per hour, and a nasogastric tube is typically required to ensure an adequate rate of administration. </p><p>WBI has been used safely in patients with gastrointestinal drug smuggling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>], and probably helps speed passage of packets, although there are no controlled studies. We suggest that promotility drugs be given to patients being treated with PEG-ELS, as these drugs improve the tolerability of WBI and hasten drug removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> (500 mg IV) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> (10 mg IV) can be used to increase motility. There is no role for cathartics as they can lead to fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. </p><p>There are no controlled studies of activated charcoal (AC) in body packers and in general we do not suggest treatment with AC in this setting. AC is likely to be more useful in body stuffers (those who ingest drugs to avoid imminent apprehension by authorities). In body packers, AC might improve outcomes in the event of a ruptured cocaine packet, but the large doses needed would be impractical and AC could be detrimental in the case of bowel perforation or if surgery or endoscopy were required. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Opioid toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Body packers who present with opioid toxicity from heroin or another opioid should be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> (Narcan). Naloxone is a competitive antagonist at the opioid receptor that reverses the depression in mental status, hypoventilation, pinpoint pupils, and decreased bowel motility of opioid overdose. However, it does <strong>not</strong> reverse opioid-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients with opioid-induced ARDS are managed in accordance with current standards. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute opioid intoxication in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical features of overdose'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute opioid intoxication in adults&quot;, section on 'Lung injury and ARDS'</a>.)</p><p>Enormous amounts of heroin are released when a single packet ruptures; consequently, very high doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> may be required to reverse toxicity in body packers. In such patients, an appropriate initial dose is 2 to 5 mg IV, with repeat doses of 2 mg given every five minutes until the patient is responsive. The <strong>total</strong> amount given to achieve a response should then be given <strong>every</strong> hour as a continuous naloxone infusion until all packets have passed.</p><p>Once the patient with heroin toxicity is stabilized with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a>, they should be managed in a similar fashion to the asymptomatic body packer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Sympathomimetic (cocaine or amphetamine) toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Body packers who present with cocaine toxicity should receive immediate, emergency surgical evaluation and be taken to the operating room for surgical decontamination. There is no &quot;antidote&quot; for cocaine or amphetamine toxicity, and therefore no place for conservative management of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

Intestinal complications are more common than esophageal complications, but both are reported.</p><p>The treatment of these patients is surgical. The patient with evidence of gastrointestinal perforation should undergo immediate exploratory laparotomy. One or more enterotomies should be made in the bowel; packets are then &quot;milked&quot; towards the enterotomy site or the anus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. </p><p>After surgical decontamination, the patient should undergo an advanced radiographic imaging study to document a clear GI tract, as packets may be missed during operative evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4448210\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopic removal of packets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although endoscopic removal is highly controversial, there are reports of successful endoscopic removal of drug packets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. The risk associated with this approach is primarily packet perforation, which can release dangerous amounts of drug. </p><p>With the sophisticated packaging now commonly used by body packers, we believe that endoscopy is safe when performed in a highly controlled setting, especially when a packet that has already passed is available to test its strength against the snare. Only asymptomatic patients are candidates for endoscopy and only when whole bowel irrigation has failed or is otherwise contraindicated. Since each packet requires repeated passage of the endoscope, endoscopy is generally only considered for removal of a remaining packet or a few packets that have failed to pass the pylorus. Surgical backup should be available in case packet rupture occurs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3599996\"><span class=\"h2\">Documentation of packet clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the risk of delayed leak from a retained packet, complete gastrointestinal decontamination prior to discharge should be documented. Relying on a packet count based on the history is inadequate.

Plain abdominal radiographs are not sufficiently sensitive to detect a single or small number of packets. Therefore, most authorities recommend using contrast-enhanced plain radiography or, increasingly, contrast-enhanced CT scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Lower-radiation CT and MRI may be suitable alternatives, but are not preferred because they are less well studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H291137\"><span class=\"h2\">Disposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients identified with internal drug smuggling should be admitted to an intensive care setting, regardless of symptoms.

Regional poison control centers in the United States are available at all times for consultation on patients who are critically ill, require admission, or have clinical pictures that are unclear (1-800-222-1222). In addition, some hospitals have clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medical toxicologists available for bedside consultation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inpatient care.

Most often, drug packets are swallowed, but they may be inserted into the rectum or vagina. Each packet contains approximately 8 to 10 g of drug. Packers generally swallow between 50 to 100 drug containers, but larger numbers may be involved. (See <a href=\"#H83249577\" class=\"local\">'Methods of body packing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body packers typically present in custody and without symptoms, with signs of systemic drug toxicity if a packet ruptures, or with symptoms and signs from intestinal obstruction or perforation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although body packers may be unreliable, every attempt should be made to elicit an accurate history that includes the following: drug being carried; type of packet wrapping; number of packets ingested; and the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms (pain, distention, or obstipation) suggesting obstruction or perforation. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'History and physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Packets are sometimes felt on abdominal, vaginal, or rectal examination. The presence of a &quot;toxic syndrome&quot; or &quot;toxidrome&quot; (a constellation of physical findings suggesting toxicity from a particular drug) suggests leakage of drug from a drug packet. Of particular importance are symptoms and signs consistent with cocaine toxicity (agitation, hypertension, tachycardia, mydriatic pupils, and diaphoresis), which should be presumed to be fatal given the large doses found in packets. The attached table summarizes the findings associated with common toxic syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71268 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of body packing is usually confirmed through radiographic imaging, usually a plain abdominal radiograph. Urinalysis is an unreliable method for screening potential body packers and should not be used for this purpose. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Indications and approach to radiographic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are asymptomatic can be managed expectantly, without surgery, with close monitoring in an intensive care setting until the passage of all packets is complete. We suggest treating asymptomatic patients with whole bowel irrigation using a polyethylene <span class=\"nowrap\">glycol/electrolyte</span> lavage solution to promote clearance (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who present with heroin toxicity should be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a>.
