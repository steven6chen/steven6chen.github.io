Given the limited life expectancy of many of these patients and the coexisting morbidity, minimally invasive methods for local ablation of skeletal metastases have been developed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The earliest reports showed image-guided radiofrequency ablation with monopolar devices to be efficacious in the treatment of symptomatic bone metastases.

Most commonly, ablation is used to treat painful skeletal metastases in patients whose disease has progressed or whose pain persists after radiation therapy, or in those who have declined radiation therapy. Ablation may also be applied to palliate metastatic lesions that are not painful but are contributing to symptoms of hormone excess (eg, pheochromocytomas) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image-guided-ablation-of-skeletal-metastases/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Patients should experience moderate to severe pain, typically considered to be at least a score of 4 on a standardized 10-point pain scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62346\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62346 \">figure 1</a>). Patients with pain scores below this level inconsistently respond to ablation and are better treated with oral analgesics.

Osteoblastic lesions may be treated, although they are frequently diffuse when present, and intact bone may present a challenge during ablation device placement.

A 1 cm or greater margin between the target lesion to be treated and the nearest critical structure is preferred.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H747528\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few absolute contraindications to percutaneous ablation. These include uncorrectable bleeding diatheses, inability of the patient to tolerate the level of anesthesia required to perform the procedure, and inaccessibility of the target lesion from a percutaneous approach. </p><p>Active infection is a strong relative contraindication given the potential to seed necrotic, ablated tissue with circulating microorganisms. Additional relative contraindications include widespread skeletal metastases, for which a systemic approach (eg, radionuclide therapy) would be more appropriate, and tumors near critical normal structures, which cannot be displaced or monitored adequately to allow safe ablation.

Radiation approaches to these patients are discussed elsewhere.

Neural structures should be avoided in the ablation target whenever possible. </p><p/><p>For palliation of bone pain, an important goal of preprocedural imaging is to allow correlation of the site of pain experienced by the patient to an accessible target tumor. This may require scanning the area of interest with a radiopaque surface marker placed by the patient or provider at the symptomatic site. </p><p>In addition, for patients with suspected oligometastatic disease, another goal of preprocedural imaging is to stage the patient accurately in order to prevent unexpected application of focal therapy to a few tumors in a background of diffuse disease involvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H747534\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H774414304\"><span class=\"h2\">General aspects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most bone ablation procedures are performed under general anesthesia, although less complex lesions (ie, superficial, small, easily accessible, predominately osteolytic or soft tissue lesions remote from normal vital structures) may be treated with the patient under moderate sedation (which includes sedatives as well as opioid analgesics). An advantage of lower level sedation is that it permits the use of intraprocedural-focused neurologic physical examination as a means of monitoring vulnerable neural structures.</p><p>Most procedures are performed under appropriate cross-sectional imaging guidance. Fluoroscopy may be useful for portions of the procedure; however, cross-sectional imaging is usually needed to monitor ablation zones and avoid critical structures. Computed tomography (CT) is the most commonly used modality for guidance given its widespread availability and excellent delineation of tumor and surrounding structures. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides superior tumor depiction in bone, the MRI suite is a difficult environment for most procedures, and MRI-compatible instruments remain limited. Ultrasound may be used for some superficial, predominately soft tissue lesions, particularly in the ribs or extremities. </p><p>The target lesion should be separated from adjacent critical structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image-guided-ablation-of-skeletal-metastases/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This can be accomplished through patient positioning or through displacement techniques using fluid (hydrodisplacement), balloons, or gas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image-guided-ablation-of-skeletal-metastases/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Most ablative techniques require percutaneous placement of applicators into the target tumor. Ablation applicators may be placed directly into soft tissue metastases or into osteolytic skeletal metastases that have destroyed or thin overlying cortex. To penetrate osteoblastic metastases or lesions that are deep to intact cortical bone, bone access devices (eg, bone biopsy needles or automatic bone drills) may be required.</p><p>The ablation zone should be monitored during the procedure with real-time imaging. Vulnerable adjacent nerves may be monitored electrophysiologically or by physical examination if lower level sedation is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image-guided-ablation-of-skeletal-metastases/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Following ablation, instillation of long-acting local anesthetic medication along the periosteum may diminish postprocedural pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H747546\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiofrequency ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been the most commonly used thermal ablation technique for tumors, including bone metastases. RFA relies upon a needle electrode to deliver a high frequency (450 to 600 kHz) alternating current that passes into the tissue from the tip of the electrode. As the ions within the tissue attempt to follow the change in the direction of the alternating current, their movement results in frictional heating of the tissue. The temperature within the tissue becomes elevated beyond 60&deg;C, and cells begin to die, resulting in a region of coagulative necrosis surrounding the electrode. Grounding pads placed on the skin surface complete the electrical circuit. </p><p>Various needle applicators are available, generally 14 to 21 gauge, with shafts that are insulated except for the 1 to 3 cm terminus placed in the tumor. Systems to use multiple needle applicators or those with expandable tips have been developed to create larger ablation zones. In addition, manufacturers have developed bipolar RFA systems to generate ablation zones that are tailored to the shape and size of the vertebral bodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image-guided-ablation-of-skeletal-metastases/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. No generator or applicator has been shown to be superior to another.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H747552\"><span class=\"h2\">Cryoablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cryoablation procedures employ needle applicators (cryoprobes) to transmit room temperature and pressurized argon and helium gases to the tumor in order to cause localized tissue freezing and thawing, respectively, along their distal uninsulated tips. By the Joule-Thomson effect, expansion of the argon gas between different chambers within each cryoprobe leads to immediate cooling about the tip to less than -100&deg;C. As intracellular and extracellular fluid freezes, tissue destruction results from cell membrane disruption by ice crystals, cellular dehydration, and vascular thrombosis at temperatures below -20 to -40&deg;C. The resultant ice ball is visible by CT, MRI, and ultrasound, with complete cell death occurring approximately 3 to 5 mm deep to the visible 0&deg;C ice ball margin. Following the freeze cycle, helium is introduced, which generates heat with expansion within the cryoprobe and allows thawing of the ice ball for probe removal. Typically, two freeze-thaw cycles are performed for each tumor.</p><p>The applicators for cryoablation may be 17 gauge or 1.2 to 2.4 mm diameter in caliber.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H774417324\"><span class=\"h2\">Focused ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Focused ultrasound (FUS), also called high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), is a novel, noninvasive method of tumor ablation. Typically using MRI guidance, FUS energy is directed at the target, raising the temperature at the imaged focal point and, thus, producing thermal tissue ablation and tissue destruction. This is done by positioning the targeted lesion directly above a water bath within the MRI table that contains the phased array transducer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image-guided-ablation-of-skeletal-metastases/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Acoustic coupling is accomplished by placing a coupling gel pad with degassed water between the patient and the chamber containing the transducer. Sonications are then performed to the MRI-defined treatment volume, with temperature rise monitored with magnetic resonance phase map imaging. Acoustic power is adjusted during the treatment so as not to exceed the thermal dose threshold between 65 and 85&deg;C. The sonication duration is approximately 30 seconds, with a cool-down duration of approximately 90 seconds between sonications. These are continued until the entire target volume has been treated.</p><p>FUS has the advantage of being completely noninvasive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image-guided-ablation-of-skeletal-metastases/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The high acoustic absorption of bone makes it particularly amenable to this technology, and osteoblastic as well as osteolytic metastases can be similarly treated. A direct acoustic window to the target lesion is needed, as bowel or neurologic structures intervening between the skin and skeletal tumor are at risk of injury. This technique is limited to the treatment of more-superficial tumors, rather than those that can be safely reached and effectively treated with other traditional percutaneous ablative modalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H747558\"><span class=\"h2\">Other emerging percutaneous techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several additional thermal and nonthermal ablative techniques that are available to treat tumors in the liver, kidneys, and lungs have been applied to skeletal metastases in limited series. These technologies include microwave ablation, laser ablation (or laser interstitial thermal therapy), and irreversible electroporation. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microwave ablation is a heat-based technique similar to RFA that uses percutaneously placed antennae (typically 17 gauge) to transmit microwave spectrum energy (915 MHz or 2.45 GHz) to a target tumor. Oscillation of water molecules within the tissue about the antennae leads to localized heating, which reaches greater temperatures faster and should theoretically penetrate intact bone better than RFA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image-guided-ablation-of-skeletal-metastases/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laser ablation utilizes neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) or diode laser fibers that are small in caliber and flexible. These fibers are placed coaxially through a thin access needle into the target tumor. These devices are more commonly used to treat small osseous lesions, such as osteoid osteomas, rather than metastases.

Electroporation can either be reversible or irreversible, the latter leading to cell death.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The direct electrical pulses in irreversible electroporation are deposited using multiple applicators; the electrical pulses form an electrical field whose magnitude decreases from the applicators outward to the tissue. Cells immediately adjacent to the applicators undergo cell death by virtue of irreversibly increased cellular permeability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is one irreversible electroporation system that is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for use in the United States for surgical ablation of soft tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image-guided-ablation-of-skeletal-metastases/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The system utilizes monopolar electrodes with a retractable sheath that allows the active tip to be adjusted between 1 and 4 cm. The generator allows for the simultaneous use of up to six electrodes to a maximum delivery of 50 A and 3000 V.

In addition, another single-institution comparative retrospective series suggested higher immediate postprocedural pain requirements following RFA as compared with cryoablation for bone metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image-guided-ablation-of-skeletal-metastases/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, this study used monopolar RFA devices rather than the bipolar devices that have been more recently developed specifically to treat spine tumors.</p><p>Each treatment modality has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of ablation technology typically depends on several factors, including individual proceduralist preference and local expertise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image-guided-ablation-of-skeletal-metastases/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RFA provides fast, effective ablation with minimal bleeding risk; however, the ablation zone cannot be monitored easily, and patients often experience increased periprocedural pain after treatment with monopolar electrodes. Newer bipolar RFA devices designed for the spine allow better conformation of ablation zone shape and size to the vertebral body. For these bipolar RFA devices, patients can be treated with moderate sedation, and their feedback can be used to avoid neural injury, as pain precedes permanent neurologic injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cryoablation delivers safe, effective ablation with easy monitoring of the ablation zone with cross-sectional imaging (and thus, more-precise targeting of the treatment field), less periprocedural pain compared with monopolar RFA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image-guided-ablation-of-skeletal-metastases/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], and the ability to treat large tumors more readily, visualize the ablation zone adjacent to critical structures, and avoid injury; its disadvantages include greater expense, due to multiple probes used in the procedure rather than overlapping ablations, and a longer procedure time. The larger potential ablation zone produced with cryoablation systems, while advantageous when treating many tumors, may sometimes be difficult to use in the spine due to poor visualization of the ice ball in intact bone using computed tomography (CT) imaging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FUS ablation has the advantage of being completely noninvasive, eliminating the need for image-guided interventional skills. Moreover, FUS systems provide immediate thermal feedback by magnetic resonance thermographic imaging. Each FUS sonication destroys a very small amount of tissue, which may be beneficial in avoiding nontarget thermal injury but adds to the time of the procedure. Disadvantages also include the high cost of the equipment and the inability to treat claustrophobic patients or those in which MRI is contraindicated. Furthermore, tumors in deep locations with intervening structures cannot be treated as these critical structures cannot be displaced as may be done in RFA or cryoablation procedures.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H747602\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of skeletal metastases usually requires a collaborative approach. External beam radiation therapy is a standard approach for symptomatic skeletal metastases, achieving pain reduction in 50 to 80 percent, which is complete in up to one-third of patients. A significant proportion do not experience complete pain relief or develop recurrent pain after radiation therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1840494377\" class=\"local\">'Overview of the approach to symptomatic skeletal metastases'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have persistent or recurrent pain attributed to one or a few skeletal sites after palliative radiation therapy and who are not surgical candidates, local thermal ablation is an important therapeutic option. Patients should have at least moderate pain levels, pain referable to a limited number of metastases that are visible on imaging, and target lesions that are remote (or separable) from normal critical structures. Other indications for thermal ablation of skeletal metastases include palliation of hormone secretion due to a metastatic hormone-producing tumor in bone, prevention of complications from progressive spinal metastases in weight-bearing bones, and local disease control in nonoperative candidates. (See <a href=\"#H747516\" class=\"local\">'Indications for image-guided ablation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absolute contraindications to thermal ablation include uncorrectable bleeding diatheses, inability of the patient to tolerate the level of anesthesia required to perform the procedure, and inaccessibility of the target lesion from a percutaneous approach. Relative contraindications include widespread skeletal metastases, the presence of active infection, or tumor location adjacent to a critical normal structure that cannot be displaced or monitored adequately to allow safe ablation. (See <a href=\"#H747528\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preprocedural imaging should enable correlation of painful sites on physical examination with visible target lesions, guide safe percutaneous access to the skeletal metastases, and assess for nearby vital structures, particularly nerves, to be avoided <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> monitored during treatment. (See <a href=\"#H699143122\" class=\"local\">'Preprocedural imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation, and focused ultrasound (FUS) are all effective ablative treatments for palliation of symptomatic skeletal metastases. There are no randomized trials comparing these procedures, and the choice of ablation technique must take into account availability, patient preference, and local expertise. Microwave ablation, laser ablation, and irreversible electroporation are emerging ablation technologies that cannot yet be recommended with the same confidence as RFA, cryoablation, or FUS. (See <a href=\"#H747576\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main complications of thermal ablation are injury to structures during applicator placement, perforation of bowel or bladder, infection, fistula formation, pathologic fracture, and injury to neural structures, which may cause weakness, paralysis, paresthesias, dysesthesia, or anesthesia. RFA may cause skin burns at the grounding pad sites, whereas cryoablation can cause frostbite if the ice ball transgresses the skin. FUS may be associated with pathologic fractures, skin burns, and injury to structures, including neural tissue, within the sonication pathway.
