When you give directions, give only 1 direction at a time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not give him or her too many choices. For example, offer only 2 choices for lunch.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Buy clothes and shoes that are easy to put on and take off.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remember that it doesn't help to argue. Try to move on to something else.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23375992\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I avoid bladder or bowel accidents?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can avoid accidents by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having your family member use the toilet every few hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not giving him or her drinks before bedtime.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23376007\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my family member isn't eating enough?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To get him or her to eat more, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give him or her many small meals each day, instead of 3 large ones.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give him or her high-protein or high-calorie drinks, such as shakes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make food easier to eat by putting it in a bowl or cutting it up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try making the food taste better by adding spices, sweet and sour flavoring, or soy sauce.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23376022\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I help my family member sleep better at night?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help him or her sleep better at night, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not let him or her nap during the day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure he or she gets enough exercise and sunlight during the day (but not right before bedtime).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open the shades in the morning to let light in.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep his or her wake up time and bed time the same every day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep the bedroom quiet, cool, and dark at night.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask the doctor or nurse if any of your family member's medicines might be making his or her sleep worse.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23376037\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my family member's behavior changes suddenly?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If his or her behavior changes suddenly, call the doctor or nurse. It could mean that your family member has an infection. That's because symptoms of Alzheimer disease often get worse when people get infections, especially bladder or lung infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23376052\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am having a hard time?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are having a hard time, let the doctor or nurse know so that he or she can find ways to get you help. Taking care of a person with Alzheimer disease is a tough job, and it usually gets harder as the disease gets worse. Don't feel bad or guilty about asking for help. Also, make sure to ask for help if your family member hurts or threatens you.</p><p>One way to get help is to take a break from caregiving. You can hire an aide to help you bathe, dress, or feed your family member. You can also find an adult day care program for your family member to go to during the day.</p><p>Another way to get help is to join a support group for caregivers of people with Alzheimer disease.</p><p>The Alzheimer's Association has a lot of information for caregivers. Their website is <a href=\"http://www.alz.org/&amp;token=0SM8TegfFRL7gaY+yqo9TIzF4NFgBRokcVREgaqxgUU=&amp;TOPIC_ID=16421\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.alz.org</a>.
