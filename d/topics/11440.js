However, there are some notable exceptions. Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) is a nonspecific term that is used to describe a range of myopathies that affect the extraocular muscles.

The ocular motility defect is typically bilateral and symmetric, and for this reason few patients complain of diplopia, even if they have dramatic or complete ophthalmoplegia. Patients also have bilateral ptosis of variable severity. The pupil is spared (external ophthalmoplegia). In addition, optic atrophy and retinal pigmentary degeneration may be present in some patients, particularly those who have mitochondrial disorders. The clinical course usually is sufficient to make the diagnosis and exclude alternative etiologies, such as myasthenia gravis.</p><p>During childhood, CPEO may be isolated or occur in conjunction with other myopathies, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kearns-Sayre syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myotonic dystrophy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myotubular myopathy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Kearns-Sayre syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kearns-Sayre syndrome is a mitochondrial cytopathy that is characterized by CPEO, retinal pigmentary changes, and heart block. Patients are typically normal at birth. Progressive ophthalmoplegia usually develops between 5 and 20 years of age, although it may occur earlier. Most cases are sporadic.</p><p>The ocular findings include bilateral and symmetric involvement of the horizontal and vertical muscles, bilateral ptosis, and normal pupils. An atypical pigmentary retinopathy (&quot;salt and pepper&quot;) may be present; some patients have a corneal opacity. The ophthalmoplegia progresses slowly over many years and is often asymptomatic because it is insidious and bilaterally symmetric. As the extraocular myopathy progresses, generalized muscle weakness and other systemic manifestations may occur.</p><p>Nonocular manifestations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac &ndash; Heart block, sometimes even sudden death (may require monitoring with sequential electrocardiograms or treatment with a pacemaker) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-affecting-the-extraocular-muscles-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic &ndash; Deafness and vestibular dysfunction, cerebellar ataxia, corticospinal dysfunction, electroencephalogram abnormalities, elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein (&gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> or widespread muscular dystrophy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endocrine and metabolic &ndash; Short stature, gonadal failure, diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, hyperaldosteronism; hypomagnesemia; and bone, tooth, and calcification abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-affecting-the-extraocular-muscles-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal &ndash; Renal tubular involvement is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-affecting-the-extraocular-muscles-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

Most patients are of French-Canadian descent and have a common ancestor from Quebec. In the French-Canadian population, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy usually follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with 100 percent penetrance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-affecting-the-extraocular-muscles-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, autosomal recessive and sporadic forms occur in other ethnic groups.

The diagnosis is usually made by the family history and clinical presentation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Myotonic dystrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myotonic dystrophy, another systemic myopathy that affects the extraocular muscles, has two forms: congenital and classical. The congenital form occurs in infants born to mothers with myotonic dystrophy. The infants present with profound hypotonia, facial diplegia, feeding problems, respiratory difficulties, and skeletal deformities, such as clubfeet. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The classical form of the disease has onset in adolescence or adulthood. Ocular findings include orbicularis weakness, myotonia on lid closure, ptosis, poor eccentric gaze holding, slow saccades, sluggish, miotic pupils, blepharitis, dry-eye syndrome, low intraocular pressure (hypotony), lens changes (eg, polychromatic cataracts, posterior cortex star, posterior subcapsular cataract), and pigmentary changes in macula. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cataract-in-children#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cataract in children&quot;, section on 'Disease-associated'</a>.)</p><p>Nonocular findings include frontal baldness, testicular atrophy, cardiac abnormalities (eg, cardiomyopathy, conduction defects), narrow hatchet facies, and slack jaw.</p><p>The EMG demonstrates myopathic potentials and myotonia. Muscle histology may reveal internal nuclei, type I fiber atrophy, and ring fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-affecting-the-extraocular-muscles-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Myotubular myopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Centronuclear myotubular myopathy is a rare X-linked congenital myopathy. Male infants have marked hypotonia and skeletal muscle weakness. Respiratory muscle impairment leads to respiratory failure. Facial weakness, ptosis, and extraocular muscle weakness typically occur, and impaired bulbar function contributes to feeding difficulty. Heterozygous female carriers may present with limb girdle and facial weakness. A more common form of the disorder occurs in both males and females and consists of relatively mild weakness and hypotonia that may be unrecognized in the neonatal period. Myotubular myopathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any infant who has hypotonia and either ptosis or ophthalmoplegia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-infant-with-hypotonia-and-weakness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the infant with hypotonia and weakness&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-myopathies#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital myopathies&quot;, section on 'Centronuclear (myotubular) myopathies'</a>.)</p><p>Similar clinical manifestations may be seen in neonatal or congenital myasthenia gravis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-affecting-the-extraocular-muscles-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], a disorder that must be excluded. Administration of an anticholinesterase inhibitor results in improvement in symptoms (eg, oxygenation, ventilation, or sucking) in infants with myasthenia gravis, but not those with myotubular myopathy.

In patients in whom a mitochondrial disorder is being considered, serum and cerebrospinal lactate concentrations may be elevated, but this test is neither sensitive nor specific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-affecting-the-extraocular-muscles-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Myopathic potentials and myotonia are present in myotonic dystrophy, but the EMG may not be diagnostic in early cases or in cases isolated to the extraocular muscles (isolated CPEO). EMG in other disorders may confirm evidence of myopathy but is not specific. EMG of the extraocular muscles is rarely performed except in institutions with research interests.</p><p>A number of mitochondrial mutations have been reported in patients with CPEO syndromes, and mitochondrial DNA studies may be helpful for diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-affecting-the-extraocular-muscles-in-children/abstract/11-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-17</a>]. These tests are not universally available and usually require specialty laboratory testing.</p><p>Mutations in the POLG gene cause many of the inherited mitochondrial diseases in children and can produce a diverse group of phenotypes including autosomal recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia (arPEO) and autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (adPEO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-affecting-the-extraocular-muscles-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiologic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of CPEO is usually made clinically. Neuroimaging studies are performed primarily to exclude alternative etiologies for ophthalmoplegia.</p><p>Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with CPEO may show signal abnormalities in the brainstem, brain, and thalami, and in extraocular muscle volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-affecting-the-extraocular-muscles-in-children/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In one study, digitally measured extraocular muscle volume in subjects with CPEO was reduced compared with control subjects (215 mm3 versus 366 mm3 for the medial rectus, 202 mm3 versus 365 mm3 for the inferior rectus, and 269 mm3 versus 425 mm3 for the lateral rectus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-affecting-the-extraocular-muscles-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This finding may help to distinguish CPEO from other conditions causing ophthalmoplegia. MR spectroscopy may show elevated lactate levels within regions of brain signal abnormalities in patients with Kearns-Sayre syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-affecting-the-extraocular-muscles-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>We recommend obtaining an MRI of the extraocular muscles in all patients with CPEO, and MR spectroscopy in selected patients (eg, those suspected to have Kearns-Sayre syndrome).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapy for CPEO is supportive. Ptosis surgery can be performed in severely affected patients. However, extreme care must be taken to avoid overcorrection because of the risk of exposure keratopathy from the ophthalmoplegia and loss of Bell's phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-affecting-the-extraocular-muscles-in-children/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Bell's phenomenon is the rolling up of the eyes when the eyelids are closed; it typically occurs during sleep or with forced lid closure, but is lost in patients with CPEO. The loss of Bell's phenomenon in conjunction with postoperative lagophthalmos (ie, incomplete eyelid closure) after correction of ptosis may result in corneal exposure, placing the patient at risk for exposure keratopathy.</p><p>Strabismus surgery can be performed to align the eyes, although it is not always necessary because involvement in CPEO tends to be bilateral and symmetric. The patients who do not require strabismus surgery tend to adapt to their ophthalmoplegia by turning their head or face to compensate for loss of gaze function. Such patients can be followed annually by the ophthalmologist. They may need special accommodations in school and may have activity restrictions, depending upon the presence and extent of associated myopathy.
