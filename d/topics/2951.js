Within the first week of life, the remnant umbilical cord stump separates from the neonate, creating the umbilicus (commonly referred to as the navel).</p><p>Infection, hernia, granulomas, and congenital anomalies can occur in the umbilicus and are more commonly seen in infancy.</p><p>The care of the umbilical cord after delivery and clinical problems associated with the umbilicus will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Umbilical cord</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The umbilical cord contains two arteries and one vein, which are surrounded and supported by gelatinous tissue called Wharton's jelly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Thickness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At birth, the average diameter and circumference of the umbilical cord in a normal term infant is 1.5 and 3.6 cm, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Both thick and thin cords are associated with increased risk of significant pathology.

Within each gestational age group, the length is highly variable. As an example, in term infants born between 40 and 41 weeks gestation, the umbilical length varies from 35 to 80 cm.</p><p>Although the cord length has no effect on fetal blood flow, both long and short cords are associated with adverse effects (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gross-examination-of-the-placenta#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gross examination of the placenta&quot;, section on 'Umbilical cord'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With longer umbilical cords, there is an increased risk of cord knots, nuchal cords (umbilical cord coiled around the neck of the fetus at the time of birth), cord prolapse, thrombi, and fetal demise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short umbilical cords (&lt;35 cm) have been associated with placental abruption and developmental abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Short cords with no coiling are associated with poor fetal growth and decreased activity, which can occur in fetuses with severe neural and musculoskeletal abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Coiling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the umbilical vessels are longer than the cord itself, twisting and bending of the vessels within the cord is common. Coiling of the umbilical cord is thought to protect the blood supply from mechanical disruption.</p><p>Although the mechanism of coiling is unknown, both excessive hypo- and hypercoiling are associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. This was illustrated in a review of 885 infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with umbilical cord index (number of coils divided by the length of cord in cm) below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile were more likely to be premature, have a trisomic genetic abnormality, or have a single umbilical artery (SUA).

The umbilicus is lower than usual in patients with achondroplasia, displaced superiorly during pregnancy, and inferiorly by ascites (Tanyol's sign) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Abnormal umbilical appearance or location may be a finding in a genetic disorder such as those illustrated by the following examples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Robinow's syndrome, a rare inherited disorder of short stature and macrocephaly with frontal bossing, the umbilicus is high, flat, and poorly epithelialized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that includes malformations of the anterior chamber of the eye and teeth, the umbilicus is broad and prominent with a large stalk and redundant skin.

This narrowed opening contains the umbilical vessels, the urachus, and the omphalomesenteric duct. The omphalomesenteric duct connects the yolk sac to the developing gut. At the same time, the allantois, a diverticulum of the caudal hindgut, forms and becomes the urachus. The urachus connects the developing genitourinary tract (bladder) to the umbilicus.</p><p>In normal development, both the omphalomesenteric duct and urachus involute. After involution, no remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct persists, but, in contrast, a remnant of the urachus persists and can be seen in some individuals extending from the bladder to the umbilicus in the preperitoneal midline.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">UMBILICAL CORD AT BIRTH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Newborn examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After delivery, the clamped umbilical cord of the newborn infant is inspected for its general appearance, including the presence of discharge or a single umbilical artery (SUA).</p><p>A thick cord may contain bowel, embryonic remnants (omphalomesenteric duct or urachal elements), or a vascular anomaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Thus, evaluation of infants with a thick cord should include histologic examination of the umbilical stump and consideration of ultrasonography to detect embryonic remnants or bowel involvement, and cystourography to detect urologic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Thin cords less than 1 cm in circumference are associated with infants who are postdates or small for gestational age (SGA).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Single umbilical artery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An SUA is present in 0.2 to 0.6 percent of live births, occurring more frequently in SGA and premature infants, and twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>].</p><p>In infants with SUA, there is an increased rate of chromosomal and other congenital anomalies. Multiple studies have shown that 20 to 30 percent of neonates with SUA had major structural anomalies, often involving multiple organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. The most commonly affected organs are the heart, gastrointestinal tract, and the central nervous system.</p><p>SUA is an isolated finding in the remaining 70 to 80 percent of infants. In these neonates, there is an increased incidence of occult renal anomalies. This was illustrated in a meta-analysis of seven studies that included 204 infants who were screened for renal malformations either by ultrasonography or intravenous pyelography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A renal anomaly was detected in 16 percent of these infants. However, the abnormality was persistent and considered clinically significant in only one-half (8 percent). Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) of grade 2 or higher was the major renal finding and was found in 3 percent of the total study population.</p><p>A subsequent prospective study of infants born over six years at a single English institution identified 137 of 33,057 live-born infants (4.<span class=\"nowrap\">1/1000)</span> with SUA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Eight infants had major congenital anomalies (eg, complex heart disease, cloaca, anorectal, abnormal karyotypes, cystic adenomatoid malformation, and multiple anomalies), and three had minor anomalies (eg, preauricular skin tag, preaxial polydactyly, and syndactyly). Infants with SUA had a lower gestational age and were more likely to be SGA than control infants with two umbilical arteries. In infants with isolated SUA, 117 of the 122 infants who underwent renal ultrasonography had normal scans. Two infants had significant renal abnormalities: a hypodysplastic kidney, which was already detected prenatally, and a single kidney. Renal anomalies were more common among infants with isolated SUA compared with the control cohort (4.1 versus 0.9 percent). There was no statistical difference in the risk of significant clinical renal abnormalities defined by the authors (1.6 versus 0.4 percent).</p><p>Similar results were seen in a study of 65 infants with SUA from the Netherlands that reported a clinically insignificant renal abnormality in 1 of 57 cases of isolated SUA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Opinions differ on the value of screening these infants for renal abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. However, based upon currently available data, we do <strong>not</strong> perform further imaging for healthy term infants with an isolated SUA, as there is a low likelihood of a renal or urological abnormality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Cord care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of the care of the umbilical cord in reducing the risk of infection is dependent upon the quality of care at delivery and postnatally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In all settings, the cord should be cut with a sterile blade or scissors, preferably using sterile gloves, to prevent bacterial contamination leading to omphalitis or neonatal tetanus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low medical resources &ndash; In a setting of low medical resources with a high risk of omphalitis, the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chlorhexidine</a> (an antiseptic topical agent) is a beneficial and inexpensive option that reduces neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a meta-analysis of community-based trials, the use of chlorhexidine reduced all-cause mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.81, 95% CI 0.71-0.92) and risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">omphalitis/infections</span> (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.4-0.57) compared with dry cord care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospital delivery &ndash; In the hospital setting, where aseptic care is routine in the clamping and cutting of the umbilical cord, dry cord care is recommended. Additional antiseptic topical care is not necessary, as it does not significantly reduce the already low risk of omphalitis in settings that use routine aseptic care to clamp and cut the umbilical cord.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A meta-analysis of trials conducted in hospital settings reported no difference in the risk of omphalitis between routine dry cord care and any antiseptic topical agent including triple dye, alcohol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chlorhexidine</a>, salicylic sugar powder, or green clay powder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76549\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76549 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A second meta-analysis that only compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chlorhexidine</a> cleaning with dry cord care reported no difference in mortality (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01-2.04), but a reduction in the risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">omphalitis/infection</span> with chlorhexidine cord cleansing (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28-0.84) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, it should be noted that the overall risk of omphalitis is 0.7 percent in hospital settings so the absolute risk reduction is relatively small.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A subsequent French cluster-randomized trial demonstrated noninferiority of dry cord care versus the use of antiseptics in preventing omphalitis (0.07 versus 0 percent; crude difference of 0.07, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.21) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p>Inappropriate cord care also can increase umbilical infections. As an example, neonatal tetanus has been reported as a complication of inappropriate application of cow dung or bentonite clay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetanus#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tetanus&quot;, section on 'Neonatal tetanus'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Cord separation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cord separation normally occurs one week after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This was illustrated in a subsequent study of the previously mentioned Nepalese community-based trial that demonstrated a mean umbilical separation time of 4.2, 4.3, and 5.3 days in infants who received dry care, <span class=\"nowrap\">soap/water,</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chlorhexidine</a> umbilical cord care, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In addition, multiple cleansings with chlorhexidine increased the time for cord separation to a mean duration of 7.5 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Longer time periods to separation are associated with other antiseptic topical agents used in cord care including salicylate sugar powder (mean 5.6 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], 70 percent alcohol (mean 16.9 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], and triple dye (range three to eight weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Umbilical cord separation is initiated by thrombosis and contraction of the umbilical vessels followed by phagocyte-mediated tissue breakdown and epithelialization of the cord stump. Stump colonization by bacteria derived from the maternal genital tract or environment occurs soon after birth, and in some cases can cause umbilical infections. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Omphalitis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Delayed separation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delayed cord separation does not have a specific definition, primarily because of the variation in normal cord separation. In general, any cord that persists after three weeks probably represents delayed cord separation. Delayed cord separation can be associated with underlying immunodeficiency, infection, or urachal abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Neutrophil function should be evaluated in infants with delayed cord separation and signs of umbilical infection because infants with leukocyte adhesion defects often present with these findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukocyte-adhesion deficiency&quot;, section on 'LAD I'</a>.)</p><p>Although there are no data on the care of cords that fail to separate in the normal time frame of three weeks, these cords usually will separate without intervention eventually. Rubbing alcohol should not be applied to the cord as it may kill bacteria that assist in cord drying and separation. Drying of the cord may be helped by keeping the diaper folded below the cord, thereby exposing the cord to air. In some instances, after the cord has desiccated, it may be removed by a healthcare provider using a scissor or scalpel by dividing the desiccated tissue just distal to the normal skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">OMPHALOMESENTERIC DUCT ANOMALIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Partial or complete failure of involution of the omphalomesenteric duct can lead to a spectrum of anomalies in the newborn infant due to varying degrees and location of duct patency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62526\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62526 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete patency results in the omphalomesenteric duct directly connecting the umbilicus to the terminal ileum.

The most common symptoms were rectal bleeding due to Meckel's diverticulum and intestinal obstruction; abdominal pain and bilious umbilical drainage were much less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Among the 132 asymptomatic patients, Meckel's diverticulum was incidentally found at laparotomy.</p><p>Because more than one omphalomesenteric duct anomaly can be present, radiologic evaluation should be performed in patients with an omphalomesenteric duct anomaly. This should include ultrasonography and possibly a Meckel scan (99m technetium pertechnetate, which has an affinity for gastric mucosa). If the results from ultrasonography are uncertain, computed tomography is performed.

In older asymptomatic adults, the decision for resection is dependent on the age of the patient, size, and whether there is a palpable abnormality, but in children, surgical resection is performed for both symptomatic and any incidentally found asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum because of the lifetime risk of complications and malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

In a retrospective review of the radiologic database from a Canadian tertiary pediatric center, urachal anomalies were found incidentally in 1 percent of all patients who underwent abdominal imaging studies performed between 2000 and 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

In adults, if there is an opening at the umbilicus, a sinogram (radiocontrast injection into urachal opening) can be used to diagnose a patent urachus or urachal sinus. However, sinograms are difficult to perform in children and are usually performed in the operating room at the time of planned resection, if indicated. If a small urachal remnant is found adjacent to the bladder, many surgeons now opt to follow these since the risk to benefit ratio for resection is not clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Prompt aggressive surgery, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and supportive care are critical in the management of necrotizing fasciitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In addition to debridement of the involved abdominal wall, it is important to resect the umbilical vein, both umbilical arteries, and any urachal remnant that is present, as these may be involved in the necrotizing infection (even if they look normal). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Necrotizing soft tissue infections&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Funisitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Funisitis is inflammation of the umbilical cord that occurs with chorioamnionitis (in response to intraamniotic infection). Funisitis involves only the external surface of the cord and Wharton's jelly and does not involve the umbilical vessels. The inflammatory cells seen migrating through the fetal vessels in the cord are evidence of a fetal response to an external pathologic factor that is maternal in origin.</p><p>Funisitis does not involve the umbilical stump. Necrotizing funisitis occurs with long-standing infection and is characterized by inflammatory debris and calcification of umbilical cord tissues. Infants with funisitis can be born healthy, but should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (similar to the regimen used for omphalitis) for a minimum of seven days of therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-placental-pathology-report\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The placental pathology report&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Infected umbilical piercing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infected umbilical piercings are characterized by purulent discharge from the pierced skin with surrounding induration, erythema, and tenderness.</p><p>Local wound care and topical antibiotics usually are sufficient for resolution of local infection in older children, and it is usually not necessary to remove the device. When infection persists or occurs in a child younger than one year of age, oral antibiotics aimed at treating <em>S. aureus</em> and <em>S. pyogenes</em> are recommended. Neonates with an infected umbilicus require an evaluation for sepsis and intravenous antibiotics.

Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Umbilical cord'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the newborn, the most common cause of umbilical drainage is umbilical granuloma. Other causes of umbilical drainage include omphalitis and umbilical anomalies, such as omphalomesenteric duct and urachal abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Newborn examination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Umbilical granuloma'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Other abnormalities'</a> above and <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Omphalitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single umbilical artery (SUA) is seen in 0.2 to 0.6 percent of live births, of whom 20 to 30 percent will have other major structural anomalies. Although infants with an isolated finding of SUA have an increased risk of occult renal anomalies, these are generally not clinically significant. As a result, in patients with isolated SUA, we suggest <strong>not</strong> to perform a screening renal ultrasonography (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Single umbilical artery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the neonate, umbilical cord care is directed toward reducing the risk of umbilical infection and is dependent upon the quality of care at delivery and postnatally. In developing countries where there is an increased risk for omphalitis, we recommend antiseptic topical cord care (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chlorhexidine</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Cord care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Umbilical cord separation usually occurs within the first week of life. Delayed cord separation is associated with underlying immunodeficiency, infection, or urachal anomaly. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Cord separation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Umbilical hernias are commonly found in children, generally easily reducible, and usually resolve without intervention over the first five years of life. Surgical repair is required in those patients with incarcerated hernia. We suggest surgical repair for patients with large defects (&gt;1.5 cm in diameter) that fail to decrease in size or are symptomatic or fail to close in children greater than five years of age (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Umbilical granuloma is the most common umbilical mass. It is usually detected after cord separation because of persistent drainage. Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">silver nitrate</a> is most commonly used to treat this lesion. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Umbilical granuloma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failed embryologic closure of the omphalomesenteric duct results in a range of anomalies including completely patent duct, umbilical polyp, Meckel's diverticulum, omphalomesenteric duct cyst, or intraabdominal fibrous band. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Embryology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Omphalomesenteric duct anomalies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failed embryologic closure of the urachus results in a range of anomalies including patent urachus, umbilical polyp, bladder diverticulum, or urachal cyst. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Embryology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Urachal anomalies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Omphalitis, a polymicrobial infection of the umbilicus and surrounding tissue, occurs predominantly in the neonate. Complications include sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis, which has a high mortality rate. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Omphalitis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Necrotizing fasciitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic treatment of omphalitis is required and is directed against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. We suggest initial parenteral administration of antistaphylococcal and aminoglycoside agents, as opposed to topical or oral antibiotic therapy, in infants with omphalitis to reduce the risk of severe complications (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In communities with a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vancomycin</a> is typically used as an alternative to an antistaphylococcal penicillin (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
