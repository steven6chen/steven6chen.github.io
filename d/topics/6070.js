These advances are largely due to the introduction of linear scanning instruments that can be used to place devices into the ultrasound plane of view, permitting various interventions to be performed. The ability of EUS to guide a biopsy needle into lesions that are too small to be identified by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, or too well encased by surrounding vascular structures to allow percutaneous biopsy, secures its role in a variety of clinical settings.</p><p>Indications for EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) include biopsy of mucosal and submucosal lesions in which prior conventional endoscopic biopsies have been nondiagnostic. The procedure is most commonly used to sample peri-intestinal structures such as lymph nodes and masses in the pancreas, liver, adrenal gland, and bile duct. It has also been used to aspirate peritoneal and pleural fluid.</p><p>This topic review will summarize experience with EUS-FNA in the gastrointestinal tract. A discussion on EUS-guided trucut biopsy is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-trucut-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound-guided trucut biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109379195\"><span class=\"h1\">EQUIPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of different endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) devices are available. Most are similar to standard endoscopic instruments in that they have biopsy channels and video or fiberoptic endoscopic capability. They differ from normal endoscopes by having sophisticated ultrasound transmission and reception capability at the tip of the instrument.</p><p>&quot;Linear&quot; instruments scan in the same plane as the long axis of the endoscope, whereas mechanical &quot;radial&quot; instruments have a rotating mechanical ultrasound probe that scans in a circle at 90 degrees to the long axis of the endoscope. The ultrasound signal is then integrated by a complex processor and transmitted in real time to a video screen. Until recently, electronic (linear) and mechanical (radial) EUS instruments required separate processors, adding significantly to the cost of providing a comprehensive EUS service. However, 360-degree electronic radial echoendoscopes have been developed, allowing for use of a curvilinear array and a radial echoendoscope by a single processor, thus economizing EUS service.</p><p>The electronic curved linear array echoendoscope is optimal for performing EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) since it permits real-time visualization of the needle as it is advanced into the periluminal space (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54912\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54912 \">table 1</a>).<strong> </strong>This instrument has an electronic ultrasound array that scans in the long axis of the endoscope, in line with the viewing and biopsy channels. As a result, a needle advanced through the biopsy channel into the tissue of interest is in the plane of ultrasound and thus visible in the ultrasound image in real time as the biopsy is performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68097\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68097 \">image 1</a>). EUS-FNA has also been described using a radial scanning instrument. However, with this instrument the needle cannot be visualized during its entire course, and serious complications have been described. Thus, this technique is <strong>not</strong> recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-fine-needle-aspiration-biopsy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Several needles are available for performing EUS-FNA (Cook Endoscopy Inc, Winston-Salem, NC; GIP Mediglobe, Tempe, AZ; Olympus Inc, Center Valley, PA; Boston Scientific, Natick, MA), each of which uses a catheter assembly with an attached handle mechanism that secures to the Luer lock adaptor on the echoendoscope. Needles range from 19 to 25 gauge with a depth of penetration of up to 10 cm. There is no evidence that larger bore needles provide greater diagnostic accuracy. All needles have a central stylet beveled to match the needle tip, thereby enhancing the sharpness of the device. The 19-gauge needle is quite stiff and can be difficult to manipulate in the duodenum with a sharply curved instrument. However, some more recent needles are made of more flexible material, making 19-gauge biopsy from the duodenum more practical. </p><p>Needles have also been developed to obtain core biopsies. One 19-gauge needle (EchoTip ProCore needle, Cook Endoscopy) was used in a study of 109 patients with 114 intraintestinal or extraintestinal mass lesions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peri-intestinal lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-fine-needle-aspiration-biopsy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Fine-needle biopsy was technically successful in 112 lesions (98 percent), with a sensitivity of 90 percent and a specificity of 100 percent for malignancy. This needle may increase the likelihood of obtaining tissue fragments (as opposed to a purely cytologic specimen). The frequency of tissue adequate for &quot;histologic&quot; analysis using this needle is the subject of ongoing research.</p><p>Two manufacturers have introduced needles with side holes in the hope that, with suction, tissue will prolapse into the needle from the side and then be cleaved off as the needle moves back and forth. Prospective comparative studies with these needles are not yet available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109379202\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The site selected for endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) should represent that which would provide the most advanced stage disease if malignancy is identified (eg, perigastric as opposed to paraesophageal lymph nodes in a patient with primary esophageal carcinoma) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F61998\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61998 \">image 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of esophageal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The needle catheter assembly should be advanced through the endoscope (the elevator should be down or relaxed) and secured to the Luer lock adaptor. Some degree of balloon insufflation is necessary to allow acoustic coupling. However, care should be taken to prevent puncturing the balloon with the needle tip. The risk of balloon puncture can be reduced by applying luminal pressure with the <span class=\"nowrap\">up/down</span> ratchet.</p><p>The needle should be advanced into the target lesion under direct EUS guidance. Prior to advancing the needle, flow Doppler imaging should be obtained to avoid intervening blood vessels. A swift jabbing motion is occasionally necessary to traverse the muscularis propria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> enter the lesion. When the needle has entered the lesion of interest, the stylet is removed and negative pressure is applied with a 10 mL syringe. Prior to removing the needle, the negative pressure should be released (this should be done just by releasing the syringe plunger and not forcing it back to its neutral position). Reduced negative pressure (1 to 2 mL) may result in less bloody aspirates, particularly with vascular tumors (eg, neuroendocrine) or lymph nodes. One study suggested that when biopsying lymph nodes the cellularity was increased with suction, but this did not improve the likelihood of a correct diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-fine-needle-aspiration-biopsy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The location of the aspiration within the lymph node (eg, edge or center) did not influence the accuracy of the findings. New data suggest the negative pressure arising from the withdrawal of the stylet may be sufficient for sample collection and yield more cellular specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-fine-needle-aspiration-biopsy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The optimal number of aspirates that should be obtained to maximize the chance of achieving a correct diagnosis is uncertain. A prospective study involving 95 patients with a variety of lesions estimated that at least seven passes were required for pancreatic and other miscellaneous lesions, while five appeared to be sufficient for lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-fine-needle-aspiration-biopsy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The aspirated material should be prepared by spraying it onto glass slides that have been labeled with the patient's identification using a pencil. One slide should be air-dried for on-site interpretation and the other slide should be spray fixed. In patients in whom lymphoma is in the differential diagnosis, additional material should be collected in a preservative solution that permits flow cytometry, if desired. In patients in whom an infectious etiology is suspected (eg, mediastinal lymphadenopathy), culture media can be used.</p><p>After the material has been sprayed onto the glass slides, a saline wash should be performed through the needle, and the material should also be collected to be made into a cell block. The stylet should be then wiped off to remove any remaining blood and the needle purged of any remaining fluid using air. The entire needle device can then be reassembled for further use. Ideally, a cytotechnologist or cytopathologist is present during the procedure to examine the slides, indicating when a representative cellular sample has been obtained. If this is not possible, three passes should be taken through lymph nodes and five to six passes through pancreatic masses to ensure adequate cellularity in &gt;90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-fine-needle-aspiration-biopsy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109379209\"><span class=\"h2\">Prophylactic antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis for EUS-FNA of lesions in the gastrointestinal tract are discussed elsewhere.

However, for those in whom standard EUS training has not provided the opportunity to learn FNA, a reasonable option is to attend a course and (optimally) participate in a live animal teaching class to obtain familiarity with the equipment and maneuvering of the needle device.</p><p>Training should begin with relatively easily accessible lesions (such as paraesophageal or perigastric lymph nodes) followed by more difficult lesions (such as those arising from the pancreas) once a sufficient degree of comfort has been obtained. Assistance from a radiology colleague who has interventional experience can be helpful.</p><p>The ASGE has also developed guidelines for credentialing and granting privileges for endoscopic ultrasound, recognizing the varying degrees of difficulty and technical skills required for EUS of the gastrointestinal tract (ie, pancreaticobiliary versus mucosal tumors). These guidelines represent a minimum number of procedures necessary to gauge competency and may serve as a resource for practitioners interested in acquiring these skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-fine-needle-aspiration-biopsy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109379223\"><span class=\"h1\">PANCREATIC MASSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration in the diagnosis of pancreatic masses is discussed separately.

An illustrative series included 62 patients with esophageal cancer who were considered to have resectable tumors by CT scanning. Findings on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and CT were compared, with pathologic verification of celiac axis lymph nodes as the gold standard. Compared with CT scanning, EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) had a much higher sensitivity for malignant lymph nodes (72 versus 8 percent), while the overall specificity was comparable (97 versus 100 percent). False-negative results with EUS were more likely in patients with T3 tumors (masses extending to the adventitia) and were observed only with microscopic metastases. Thus, EUS-FNA has the potential to increase the diagnostic stage in patients in whom surgery is being contemplated, which may influence the treatment strategy.</p><p>EUS-FNA may also be useful for the diagnosis of other disorders associated with enlarged peri-intestinal and peri-esophageal lymph nodes such as Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly if flow cytometry is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-fine-needle-aspiration-biopsy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].
