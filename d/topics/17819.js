As a result, patients with infrequent and mild symptoms of asthma should be treated intermittently with the goal of quick symptom relief. Patients with mild symptoms that are persistent or present regularly should additionally receive a long-term controller medication. Likewise, patients with mild, intermittent symptoms whose asthma often (more than two times per year) flares into attacks requiring oral glucocorticoids are encouraged to take daily controller medication to prevent these attacks. As with all types of asthma, effective communication, ongoing patient education, and regular reassessment of asthma control are crucial for long-term success.</p><p>The issues relating to the treatment of intermittent and persistent mild asthma in adults and adolescents will be discussed here, with an emphasis on pharmacologic therapy. The recommendations made in this review are based upon the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines, as well as similar guidelines published by the Global Initiative for Asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intermittent-and-mild-persistent-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

It is important for patients with mild asthma to understand that they are also at risk for severe, potentially life-threatening asthma attacks, like those with more severe forms of the disease.

Evidence is lacking to support the concept that therapy alters the natural history of asthma (ie, the risk of progressive loss of lung function over time, as occurs in a subset of asthmatic patients).</p><p>Asthma is associated with chronic airway inflammation that can progress over time to cause permanent structural changes in the airway wall associated with irreversible airflow obstruction. However, in some patients, the airway inflammation can persist into old age without permanent change in lung function. The development of irreversible airways obstruction appears to occur most often in those with longstanding, severe disease or a history of recurrent severe asthma exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intermittent-and-mild-persistent-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natural-history-of-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natural history of asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It would clearly be preferable to identify those patients who are destined to progress to permanent pulmonary impairment and intervene early to prevent progression to irreversible airflow obstruction. Unfortunately, the ability to predict the progression of mild asthma in this way is lacking at present. No epidemiologic studies have been performed that provide long-term physiologic (lung function) and histologic follow-up of a large cohort of adults with mild asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intermittent-and-mild-persistent-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>One small clinical trial in adults found that delayed initiation (after two years) of antiinflammatory therapy (ie, inhaled glucocorticoids) appeared to be less beneficial than treatment begun closer to the initial diagnosis of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intermittent-and-mild-persistent-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. This observation suggested that inhaled glucocorticoids might help prevent the changes in lung function that occur in some patients over time. However, several subsequent studies found that inhaled glucocorticoids do not prevent disease progression or abnormalities in lung function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intermittent-and-mild-persistent-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. Thus, there is currently no evidence that antiinflammatory therapy protects against irreversible airway obstruction over time.</p><p>As a result, many experts feel that the cost and inconvenience of regular controller therapy, combined with the benign natural history of intermittent or mild persistent asthma in most patients, argue against universal antiinflammatory treatment in an attempt to achieve long-term preservation of lung function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intermittent-and-mild-persistent-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The inhaled route of administration is preferred over tablet or liquid formulations because of the shorter time to relief, greater potency of bronchodilation, and fewer side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intermittent-and-mild-persistent-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Patients who develop asthmatic symptoms as a result of predictable triggers (eg, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction) are encouraged to use their SABA approximately 10 to 20 minutes prior to exposure in order to prevent the development of symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-agonists-in-asthma-acute-administration-and-prophylactic-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Beta agonists in asthma: Acute administration and prophylactic use&quot;</a>.)</p><p>SABAs alone are considered inadequate therapy for asthma if symptoms are not fully relieved, or if symptoms recur consistently, such that SABAs are needed more than two days a week on a regular basis (excluding special circumstances, such as during a viral respiratory infection). Such patients should be treated for mild persistent asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intermittent-and-mild-persistent-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=levalbuterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Levalbuterol</a> is the R-enantiomer of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a>, purified from the racemic mixture of R- and S-enantiomers of albuterol. It is available as a liquid for nebulization and as an MDI (Xopenex-HFA). Each MDI puff contains 45 mcg of levalbuterol (compared with 90 mcg per puff of albuterol). Its onset, duration of action, and side effect profiles are comparable to albuterol. &#160;</p><p>Some patients experience tremulousness, palpitations, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anxiety from the systemic effects of inhaled SABAs.

Worldwide, there has been a transition away from MDIs using chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellants to those using the environmentally-safe propellant, hydrofluoroalkane (HFA). The differences between CFC and HFA-based inhalers are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults#H85082029\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of inhaler devices in adults&quot;, section on 'Metered dose inhalers with CFC and HFA'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of inhaler devices in children&quot;, section on 'Propellants'</a>.)</p><p>HFA formulations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> include ProAir-HFA, Proventil-HFA, and Ventolin-HFA. An albuterol MDI with an HFA propellant has the same onset of action, duration of effect, and side effect profile as albuterol with CFC propellant, even though patients often experience a difference. The perceived difference probably relates to the fact that the plume of medication released from albuterol-HFA devices has a slower speed and less chilled temperature compared with the medication plume from traditional albuterol-CFC inhalers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delivery of inhaled medication in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>HFA inhalers have a propensity to clog at the point where the nozzle of the metal canister is seated in the well of its plastic holder. To prevent this problem, it is recommended that once weekly patients remove the canister from its plastic holder, rinse water through the holder, allow it to air-dry, and then reinsert the metal canister. In addition, the MDI should be primed before its first-time use and again if the canister has not been used for two or more weeks. Priming involves spraying one or more puffs of medication into the surrounding air because of the possibility that a submaximal amount of medication might be contained in the initial spray. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of inhaler devices in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For any inhaled medication to be effective, it needs to reach the intrathoracic airways. Proper inhalation technique is difficult for many patients, especially with MDIs. Besides coaching in proper technique and repeated reinforcement, use of a valved holding chamber or &quot;spacer&quot; can help to optimize medication delivery and therefore effectiveness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of inhaler devices in adults&quot;, section on 'Teaching inhaler use skills'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of inhaler devices in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p> Alternative delivery mechanisms are presently available; still others are likely to be introduced in the future.

Assessments of control should be based upon the interim clinical history (for which validated questionnaires such as the Asthma Control Test and Asthma Control Questionnaire are available), current pulmonary function, and the patient's level of risk of future asthma exacerbations. In brief, the criteria for good asthma control are the same criteria, listed above, used to establish asthma severity as intermittent. The concept of asthma control is presented in more detail separately and is summarized in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53233\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53233 \">table 6</a>).

Patients with mild symptoms that are persistent or present regularly should additionally receive long-term controller therapy, which, in the case of inhaled glucocorticoids, should be initiated at a low dose. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both intermittent and mild persistent asthma are characterized by a peak expiratory flow (PEF) or forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) greater than 80 percent of predicted between exacerbations. Criteria for intermittent asthma and mild persistent asthma differ in the frequency of daily and nocturnal symptoms and the number of exacerbations requiring oral glucocorticoids per year (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58247\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58247 \">table 1</a>).

A small minority of patients with mild asthma may worsen and develop irreversible airways obstruction over time, although most will not. The factors predisposing to this outcome are unknown, and antiinflammatory therapies have not been definitively shown to be protective. As a result, the primary goals of treatment are relief of symptoms and prevention of acute attacks, rather than the long-term preservation of lung function.

History taking is crucial in determining exposure to environmental allergens and irritants in the home <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> workplace. Allergy skin testing or immunoassays for specific immunoglobulin E in the blood can then supplement the history by identifying sensitivity to common aeroallergens.
