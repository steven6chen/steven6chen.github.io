For women with a history of headache, the effect of pregnancy on the frequency and severity of headache, the effect of headache on pregnancy, and the safety of maternal headache treatment for the fetus are major concerns. For women with headache first presenting during pregnancy or postpartum, a diagnostic evaluation is indicated and should include evaluation for pregnancy-related causes of headache: Preeclampsia with severe features always needs to be excluded in women over 20 weeks of gestation.</p><p>This topic will discuss issues specific to diagnosis and management of headache in pregnant and postpartum women. The diagnosis and treatment of headaches in the general population are reviewed separately.

Among pregnant women with no history of a headache and the onset of new or atypical headache who present for evaluation, one-third have preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Criteria for diagnosis of preeclampsia are described in the table and form the basis for evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79977\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79977 \">table 1</a>). The diagnosis can be excluded in normotensive women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Headache is a feature of the severe spectrum of preeclamptic disease and a potential precursor of eclampsia (preeclampsia with seizure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The headache is typically diffuse (holocephalic), constant, throbbing, and mild to severe in intensity. Blurred vision, photophobia, and confusion and alteration in the level of consciousness may occur. These symptoms are similar to those of migraine, except migraine pain is frequently unilateral. In women with mildly increased blood pressure due to pain, the diagnosis of preeclampsia-related headache is supported by the presence of other severe features of the disease: scotomata or other visual problems (eg, blurred vision, double vision, photophobia, amaurosis, hemianopsia), epigastric pain, or laboratory findings of thrombocytopenia, elevated liver chemistries, hemolysis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> elevated creatinine.</p><p>The neurologic examination is usually normal in preeclampsia. Focal neurologic symptoms suggest complicated preeclampsia (eg, stroke) or an alternative diagnosis (eg, migraine with aura, stroke unrelated to preeclampsia). Although seizure is the key finding of eclampsia, it also occurs with other intracranial pathology, including cerebral venous thrombosis, hemorrhage, and tumor (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eclampsia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eclampsia&quot;</a>). A neurologist or neurosurgeon should be consulted in women with an abnormal neurologic examination or severe headache that persists after preeclampsia\\eclampsia has been excluded. Women in whom preeclampsia\\eclampsia is suspected should have an obstetrical or maternal-fetal medicine consultation.</p><p>The cause of headache in <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia</span> is not known, but may be related to increased cerebral perfusion pressure (eg, hypertensive encephalopathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], cerebral ischemia from vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], cerebral edema, or microhemorrhages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

In addition, many women have had a neuraxial anesthetic for labor and delivery or have been given vasoactive drugs (eg, ergots). These are all risk factors for development of headache. The following basic guidelines apply to the evaluation of women with postpartum headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preeclampsia should be the initial consideration in women with hypertension. Preeclampsia can present postpartum, usually within 48 hours of delivery, but sometimes a week or more postpartum.

The pain in PDPH typically develops within 48 hours of the procedure and is worse on standing or raising the head from the bed and characteristically improves with rest in a supine position; tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, and cranial nerve dysfunction rarely occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-lumbar-puncture-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-lumbar puncture headache&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tension-type headache is the likely diagnosis in women in whom there are no focal neurologic deficits or findings consistent with preeclampsia. Migraine headache with or without aura is also common in this setting, especially in women with a history of migraine (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Migraine'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Tension-type headache'</a> below). Cluster headache is rare (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Cluster headache'</a> below). These headaches are diagnosed according to standard criteria from the International Classification for Headache Disorders (ICHD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68064\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68064 \">table 3</a>).</p><p/><p>Although headache is common postpartum, the prevalence across studies varies widely depending on the definitions used, method of ascertainment (eg, discharge diagnosis, postal survey, patient evaluation), timing (two to four days postpartum to one year after delivery), and patient population (eg, breastfeeding status). In a prospective cohort study in which most of the 381 postpartum patients had mild or moderate headache pain, the most common etiologies were tension-type, migraine, and <span class=\"nowrap\">musculoskeletal/cervicogenic</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a retrospective study of 95 women with severe unrelenting headache greater than 24 hours and less than 42 days from the time of delivery, the types and frequencies of headache were tension-type (39 percent), <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia</span> (24 percent), postdural puncture (16 percent), migraine (11 percent), pituitary <span class=\"nowrap\">hemorrhage/mass</span> (3 percent), cerebral venous thrombosis (3 percent), and other (4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Cervical arterial dissection is rare postpartum; signs and symptoms may include severe headache, neck pain, oculosympathetic paresis (Horner's syndrome), and weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3018325805\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging and lumbar puncture: Indications and safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indications for neuroimaging and lumbar puncture are similar to those in nonpregnant adults.

Use of gadolinium should be avoided unless its use significantly improves diagnostic performance and is likely to improve patient outcome, as gadolinium may have adverse effects on offspring.

Treatment decisions are made according to recommendations for nonpregnant adults, but choosing those drugs with the best safety profile for the fetus and limiting the number of medications and doses to the minimum needed to control symptoms adequately. Treatment is also guided by the woman's prior treatment successes and failures, comorbid conditions, and gestational age (first trimester [ie, after the major period of organogenesis] versus later in pregnancy). Women should have realistic expectations regarding the limits of therapy, and clinicians should be willing to treat headache pain aggressively when the woman requests aggressive treatment after a discussion of the available information about potential fetal risks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3664489059\"><span class=\"h2\">Women with preeclampsia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definitive treatment of preeclampsia is delivery to prevent development of maternal or fetal complications from disease progression.

A migraine occurring during pregnancy can generally be differentiated from a preeclampsia-related headache by assessment of the patient's blood pressure, urine protein, laboratory studies, gestational age, and whether she reports similar headaches prior to pregnancy.

Improvement has been defined as absence of attacks, less severe attacks, decreased frequency of attacks, or shorter duration of symptoms.</p><p>The most common time for recurrence is during the postpartum period.

The prevalence of migraine in women who breastfed and bottle-fed was 43 and 100 percent, respectively.
