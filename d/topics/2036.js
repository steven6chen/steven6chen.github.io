However, this response is frequently not maintained since relapse ultimately occurs in 40 to 75 percent of patients who undergo an autologous transplant and 10 to 40 percent of those who undergo an allogeneic transplant. Further, with the development of non-myeloablative or reduced intensity allogeneic transplantation there is increased reliance on immune-mediated effects to control the underlying disease.</p><p>The rationale for using immunotherapy to prevent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treat the reemergence of malignancy is based upon the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence indicates that the graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect plays a major role in reducing the risk of relapse following an allogeneic transplant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant advances have been made in our basic understanding of both the cellular populations responsible for potential antitumor activity and the cellular interactions and cytokines required for their activation and expansion.</p><p/><p>The cell populations capable of recognizing and lysing malignant targets can be divided into two broad categories based upon the mechanism of cellular recognition: cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. Significant insights have been made into the functional mechanisms of these two populations.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the basic principles underlying the pathogenesis of the GVT effect after HCT. An overview of some of the clinical trials examining immunotherapy to prevent and treat relapse following HCT is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunotherapy for the prevention and treatment of relapse following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CYTOTOXIC T CELLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before discussing how cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) recognize and become activated in response to malignant cells, it is helpful to first briefly review the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and how T cells recognize and are activated by any antigen. Genes of the MHC (called HLA in humans) encode two distinct classes of cell surface molecules, I and II. Class I MHC molecules are expressed on the surfaces of virtually all nucleated cells at varying densities, while class II MHC molecules are more restricted to cells of the immune system, primarily B lymphocytes, monocytes, and dendritic cells.</p><p>Since the principal task of the immune system is to distinguish self from non-self, HLA molecules provide the crucial surface upon which the antigen receptors on T lymphocytes (T cell receptors or TCRs) recognize foreign (non-self) antigens. On antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as macrophages and dendritic cells, class II MHC molecules present antigenic fragments (in the form of linear peptides) to the CD4+ inducer (or helper) T cells, while class I MHC molecules function at the effector phase of immunity by presenting antigens to CD8+ T cells. This process of antigen presentation consists of the binding of a single T cell receptor to a complex on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell consisting of the MHC molecule and a peptide fragment derived from the foreign antigen. Due to the central role of MHC molecules in initiating an immune response, it is not surprising that matching of these genes is the major predictor of graft-versus-host disease in the setting of allogeneic transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-histocompatibility-complex-mhc-structure-and-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) structure and function&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In addition to engagement of the T cell receptor with the MHC molecule-antigenic peptide complex, several other signals <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> functions are required for full T cell activation and expansion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>APCs must express costimulatory molecules that provide a mandatory second signal to the T cell. The major pathways are an interaction of the B7 family of molecules (B7-1 [CD80] or B7-2 [CD86]) or of CD58 (LFA-3) on antigen presenting cells with CD28 or CD2 on T cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63541\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63541 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Other co-stimulatory molecules (eg, CD30:CD30L, OX40) have also been identified. Anergy, a state in which T cells are unable to become activated in response to their normal target antigen, develops in the absence of costimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Helper T cells are also necessary for a normal immune response. They are primarily CD3+CD4+CD8-, compared with the majority of CTLs which are CD3+CD8+CD16-. Helper T cells release cytokines and provide cellular interactions (via costimulatory molecules) necessary for the appropriate stimulation of APCs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63541\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63541 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>Traditional understanding dictated that CD4+ T cells were required to produce cytokines (principally IL-2) in the local environment of the CD8+ T cells, thereby allowing for clonal expansion. This hypothesis required two populations of effector cells to be present and bind to an APC. However, studies indicate that CD4+ T cells are capable of activating APCs via engagement of CD40, which primes the APCs for more effective stimulation of CD8+ cells. These observations simplify the role of helper T cells and do not require a physical presence at the time of CD8+ T cell activation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Regulatory T cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other populations of T cells regulate immune responses. The best characterized population is that of regulatory T (Treg) cells, which express CD4 and CD25 as well as the transcription factor FoxP3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Treg cells reduce T cell proliferation and may play a major role in controlling graft versus host disease (GVHD) in murine model systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] as well as in man [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Importantly, Treg cells did not inhibit graft versus tumor (GVT) reactions in a mouse model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Further, following the adoptive transfer of regulatory T cells in the setting of haploidentical transplantation, relapse rates remain low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of graft-versus-host disease&quot;, section on 'Regulatory T cells'</a>.) </p><p>Other populations of natural killer (NK) T cells also play an important immunoregulatory role under certain biological conditions. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Natural killer cells'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Recognition of malignant cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For a donor CTL to recognize and lyse a malignant host target cell, antigen(s) expressed by the tumor must be recognized as foreign. Based upon the type of transplant, this identification principally occurs via the following two mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Donor CTLs recognize alloantigens, possibly minor histocompatibility antigens, on host cells. This is of principal importance with allogeneic transplants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CTLs also react against unique antigens expressed by the malignant host cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This can occur with any donor-recipient pair, as well as outside the transplant setting.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Self versus non-self</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With nonidentical transplants, donor CTLs may recognize neoplastic (and normal) cells as foreign due to the expression of epitopes unique to the host. CTLs may subsequently become activated, lysing such cells.</p><p>This mechanism for a GVT effect is very similar to that which underlies GVHD. When the recipient and nonidentical donor are not matched at the MHC (eg, with mismatched related or unrelated, haploidentical or cord blood donors) GVHD (or GVT) may result because of differences within the major MHC antigens. However, when the donor-recipient pair are matched for MHC antigens, GVHD (or GVT) is initiated and propagated via recognition by the T cell and its receptor of additional antigens called minor histocompatibility antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A major question in the field is whether the repertoire of T cells responsible for GVHD is the same as those responsible for GVT, and if not how much overlap between these two populations exists. Another question is whether there are truly disease-specific determinants that can be recognized by donor derived T cells. The use of high throughput sequencing of the TCR may help clarify how these different T cell populations interact in these complex biological reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The importance of this effect for the development of GVT is suggested by the different outcomes with grafts from identical twin and nonidentical donors. Patients who have an identical twin donor do not develop GVHD. However, they are at a higher risk of relapse of the underlying malignant disease than similar patients transplanted with HLA-matched but nonidentical sibling donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This is presumably due to the lack of a GVT reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>These relationships were illustrated in a review from 163 transplant centers that compared the results of 103 identical twin (syngeneic) and 1030 HLA-identical sibling (allogeneic) transplants for leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The three-year probability of relapse of leukemia was substantially higher in the syngeneic than allogeneic transplants in acute myeloid leukemia (52 versus 16 percent) and chronic myeloid leukemia (40 versus 7 percent).</p><p>The importance of the pathogenic link between GVT and GVHD is also suggested by the finding that GVHD can be induced by donor lymphocyte infusions. With this technique, lymphocytes from the original donor are administered to patients with relapsing disease to attempt to elicit a GVT reaction; this benefit is tempered by the enhanced risk of developing GVHD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunotherapy for the prevention and treatment of relapse following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, the observation that some patients clearly have GVT without GVHD suggests that these two processes may result via different mechanisms (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Possible separation of GVT from GVHD'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Expression of tumor specific antigens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CTLs, independent of origin, can also recognize malignant cells as foreign when unique antigens are expressed by the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

No consensus has emerged concerning the optimal nature and source of these antigens, particularly whether they should be in the form of peptide(s), a whole protein, DNA, or cDNA, or whether they should be introduced into dendritic cells by gene transfer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Other therapeutic maneuvers include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To expand dendritic cells from leukemic precursors; this is based upon the assumption that these cells will present leukemic specific antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To utilize T cells that are activated and expanded using beads that provide binding through CD3 and CD28. These co-stimulated T cells have been shown to provide T cell help and possibly promote a cytolytic response against tumor cells.

Expansion of these cells in the lymphopenic environment early after transplantation may be a particularly effective strategy in the induction of immune responses (eg, vaccination strategies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Malignant cells and costimulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumor cells may lack the costimulatory molecules necessary for such an interaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], which, as noted above, may lead to anergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].

Some of these interactions downregulate T cell responses and can be broadly considered physiologic &quot;brakes&quot; or &quot;checkpoints&quot; on the T cell activation that is normally triggered by antigen-presenting cells. Release of this brake with checkpoint inhibitors may augment the native or graft T cell anti-tumor response. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) are examples of checkpoints that have been targeted clinically. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy#H28828766\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of cancer immunotherapy&quot;, section on 'Checkpoint inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p>Checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in solid tumors, and initial studies in hematologic malignancies (eg, Hodgkin lymphoma) have demonstrated responses in highly pretreated patients.

These included GVHD, immune thrombocytopenia, colitis, and pneumonitis. </p><p>Further studies are underway regarding the use of checkpoint inhibitors to stimulate a more effective GVT response. A significant concern in the setting of allogeneic transplantation is whether this approach could result in worsening of GVHD. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL KILLER CELLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Natural killer (NK) cells are commonly referred to as nonspecific or MHC-nonrestricted. However, these terms are misnomers, since NK cells express receptors, which recognize MHC molecules.</p><p>The cell surface phenotype of NK cells is CD3-CD56+CD16+, although other cell populations have been described. These cells can be activated by a variety of different cytokines, particularly IL-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Cell receptors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of target cell recognition by NK cells is not completely understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Several groups have identified cell surface receptors expressed by NK cells, which recognize MHC molecules and, upon productive interaction, initiate an <strong>inhibitory</strong> signal that prevents lysis.</p><p>In humans, two distinct families of inhibitory receptors have been characterized:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One group of proteins is referred to as the killer inhibitory receptors (KIRs); they are composed of either two or three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, and recognize specific class I HLA molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>].

The best characterized activation receptor is a molecule termed NKG2D. Ligands for NKG2D include molecules such as MICA, MICB and the ULB binding proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. NKG2D ligands are upregulated by cellular stress, including viral infection and transformation. Other natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) have been identified that, upon stimulation, result in NK cell activation and more effective cytolysis.</p><p>In the setting of bone marrow transplantation, donor NK cells are inhibited upon interaction with an appropriate MHC class I molecule expressed by a normal host cell. As a result, all donor NK cells tolerate normal (eg, not malignant or infected) host cells expressing normal levels of MHC class I molecules. By comparison, tumor or virally infected cells, which either downregulate class I expression or have altered peptide expression, are recognized and killed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Several aspects of NK function are unclear, including the exact requirements for an interaction to occur; whether there are specific activator receptors; and what role activator receptors play [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Adhesion molecules appear to be required since monoclonal antibodies directed against LFA-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 inhibit NK cytolytic activity.</p><p>NK cells also express the Fc-gamma receptor (CD16); this allows cells bound by immunoglobulin to be lysed by antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity mechanisms.

By comparison, nonmalignant autologous or MHC-matched cells presumably express HLA class I molecules with the appropriate peptide; this permits binding to the inhibitory receptor expressed on the surface of the NK cell, thereby inhibiting NK cell function.</p><p>This hypothesis assumes that HLA class I molecules on the surface of tumor cells are either downregulated or alternative peptides are displayed, characteristics that block the ability of HLA class I molecules to signal through the appropriate inhibitory receptor. Experimental evidence for the lack of HLA class I expression has been found in a number of different tumor types. Alteration in peptide expression is more difficult to evaluate, but it has been observed following certain viral infections. Alternatively, expression of NKG2D ligands has been observed on a number of solid tumors and hematopoietic cell malignancies which may allow for appropriate cell recognition and lysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">MHC-mismatched transplants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A low incidence of relapse has been observed with MHC-mismatched transplants, particularly in patients with myeloid leukemias that were treated with strategies that depleted T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The newly perceived function of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity provides another possible mechanism to help explain the GVT effect in MHC-mismatched transplants. Depending upon the donor-recipient pair, host cells may lack the appropriate HLA class I molecule capable of binding to and inhibiting the inhibitory molecules expressed on the donor NK and NK-like T cells. Alloreactive NK cells are therefore created. Such NK cells, which recognize recipient tumor cells based upon the lack of inhibition through the appropriate KIR molecules, have been recently observed both before and after such transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>The presence of such alloreactive NK cells would suggest that GVHD would develop. However, for reasons that have yet to be fully elucidated, GVHD fails to emerge in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Overall, these observations support the concept that NK and NK-like T cells play a significant role in GVT reactions, particularly following haploidentical transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Adoptive transfer of NK cells has also been explored using mismatched NK cell populations, with early encouraging results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytokine production</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NK cells secrete a variety of cytokines, such as interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. These cytokines may have some direct effects on the tumor cells and may promote recruitment of other populations of effector cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Activation and expansion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of strategies have been employed to activate and expand cells with NK cell function. These cells appear to be activated with cytokines, particularly IL-2, IL-12, and IL-15 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. To enhance the antitumor function of NK cells, different methods of administering IL-2, both ex vivo and in vivo, have been used:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many groups have used IL-2 for the ex vivo activation of NK cells, thereby resulting in cells with enhanced anti-tumor cell activity (termed lymphokine activated killer [LAK] cells). However, since NK cells do not expand effectively ex vivo, it is difficult to obtain the numbers of cells required for treatment, thereby resulting in limited efficacy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The direct administration to the patient of high-dose IL-2 is associated with significant morbidity and limited enhancement in NK cell antitumor efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, dosage schedules have been developed which are reasonably well tolerated and positive results have been obtained following transplantation for NHL and AML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. In addition, the administration of low dose IL-2 to enhance antitumor NK cell activity is being applied to patients with minimal disease, a regimen that is less toxic and better tolerated than high dose IL-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Unfortunately, a randomized study of IL-2 following autologous transplantation did not result in improved outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. This may be because lower doses of IL-2 result in the expansion of regulatory T cells, which may negatively impact anti-tumor responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IL-2 has also been used to treat the marrow or peripheral blood of the donor prior to infusion to enhance the antitumor potential of the graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The active expansion of cytolytic cells derived from T cells which share functional similarities with NK cells may be obtained with the use of specific cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. These NK-like T cells, also called cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, express both T cell specific antigens (such as the T cell receptor and CD3 complex) and NK cell markers (such as CD56 or neural cell adhesion molecule) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. These ex vivo treated CD3+CD56+ cells rapidly expand following mitogenic stimulation through the T cell receptor (similar to T cells) and recognize tumor cell targets without prior exposure (similar to NK cells) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. They also produce cytokines such as GM-CSF, interferon, and tumor necrosis factor, but do not produce IL-4. NKG2D is an activating receptor on NK cells and CD8 T cells that allows for the recognition of tumor cell by these CIK cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>].</p><p>In SCID mouse model systems, NK-like T cells effectively eradicate human tumor cell lines and autologous tumor targets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. They have the advantage of being readily expandable and do not require the exogenous administration of IL-2 for in vivo activity. Clinical trials using these cells have suggested that this approach is tolerable following autologous and allogeneic transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>].

These cells lyse a broad panel of tumor cell lines, but not normal tissues, and have in vivo activity in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. The use of irradiated TALL-104 cells is in early phase clinical trials. Other NK-like cell lines have also been developed, such as NK-92, with intriguing biological activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/76-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-80</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H970600276\"><span class=\"h2\">Engineered T cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of groups have investigated the use of engineered T cells, which express novel receptors that redirect their cytotoxicity. An example that has demonstrated efficacy is through the use of chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) where the T cells are capable of recognizing tumor-associated antigens, such as CD19 and CD22. Early studies had limited success, primarily thought to be related to the poor survival of these engineered T cells. With novel constructions, including co-stimulatory molecules that improve survival of the adoptively transferred T cells, dramatic responses have been noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>].
