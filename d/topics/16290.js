Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and motor nuclei in the lower brainstem, which results in progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. This topic will review clinical aspects of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), with a focus on SMN1 gene-related SMA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2096205246\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The inheritance pattern of chromosome 5q-related SMA is autosomal recessive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The different forms of 5q-SMA are caused by biallelic deletions or mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene on chromosome 5q13.2, resulting in deficiency of the SMN1 protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. The most common mutation of the SMN1 gene is a deletion of exon 7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Approximately 94 percent of patients with clinically typical SMA carry homozygous deletions of exon 7. SMN protein appears to play a role in mRNA synthesis in motor neurons and also may inhibit apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>The differences in SMN protein activity and phenotypic expression appear to be related in part to a modifying gene, called SMN2. The SMN1 and SMN2 genes are more than 99 percent identical and lie within an inverted duplication on chromosome 5q13.2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The SMN1 gene lies telomeric of the SMN2 gene. The main difference between them is a C to T transition in exon 7 of the SMN2 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. This change leads to production of a truncated, nonfunctional SMN protein from the majority of SMN2-derived mRNAs. However, about 10 to 15 percent of mRNAs from SMN2 contain exon 7 and can produce some functional, full-length SMN protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Thus, loss of the SMN1 protein is partially compensated by SMN2 protein synthesis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F112225\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112225 \">figure 1</a>), a mechanism that explains some but not all of the phenotypic variability in patients with SMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Disease severity in SMA generally correlates inversely with SMN2 gene copy number, which varies from 0 to 8 in the normal population, and to a lesser degree with the level of SMN protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/11,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13-16</a>]. The presence of three or more copies of SMN2 is associated with a milder phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>].</p><p>While the most common forms of SMA are caused by deletions or mutations in the SMN1 gene on chromosome 5q (ie, 5q SMAs), there are a number of rare non-5q spinal muscular atrophies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/15,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17,18</a>]. The non-5q SMAs are genetically and clinically heterogeneous (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73754\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73754 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2830616317\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of spinal muscular atrophy ranges from 4 to 10 per 100,000 live births, and the carrier frequency of disease-causing SMN1 mutations ranges from <span class=\"nowrap\">1/90</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">1/47</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/1,19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,19-22</a>]. SMA is the most common monogenic cause of infant mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SMA disorders are characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and motor nuclei in the lower brainstem, which results in progressive muscle weakness and atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/16,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,23</a>]. Cognition is unaffected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. These diseases were traditionally classified into types 1 to 3, and now are classified as types 0 through 4, depending upon the age of onset and clinical course (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112224\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112224 \">table 2</a>). SMA type 0 (prenatal onset) and SMA type 1 (infantile onset) are the most common and severe types. SMA type 2 and SMA type 3 have a later onset and a less severe course. SMA type 4 (adult onset) is the least severe type. While these subtypes are clinically useful for prognostic and therapeutic considerations, it is clear that SMA phenotypes span a spectrum of severity without discrete separation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Disease severity in SMA generally correlates inversely with SMN2 gene copy number, which varies in the normal population, and to a lesser degree with the level of SMN protein. (See <a href=\"#H2096205246\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients with all forms of SMA have diffuse symmetric proximal muscle weakness that is greater in the lower than upper limbs, and absent or markedly decreased deep tendon reflexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, SMA is associated with a restrictive, progressive respiratory insufficiency, particularly SMA type 0 and type 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Less commonly, sleep disturbances can occur in children with SMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], and congenital heart defects may accompany SMA type 0 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. While there have been occasional reports of heart rhythm abnormalities in SMA types 1, 2, and 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], these may be coincidental associations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/23,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3758918509\"><span class=\"h2\">SMA type 0</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the expanded classification, SMA type 0 designates prenatal onset of SMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>], although prenatal onset was traditionally classified as SMA type 1. Mothers of affected patients with SMN 0 may recognize a decrease or loss of fetal movement in late pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. At birth, infants with SMA type 0 have severe weakness and hypotonia, often with areflexia, facial diplegia, and congenital heart defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/1,16,28,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16,28,35,36</a>]. Arthrogryposis (multiple joint contractures) may be present. No motor milestones are achieved. Death occurs from respiratory failure by age six months, and usually by one month. Infants with SMA of neonatal onset may present with signs of fetal hypokinesia deformation sequence, including polyhydramnios, intrauterine growth retardation, skeletal abnormalities with multiple articular contractures, and pulmonary hypoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Infants with SMA type 0 generally have only one copy of the SMN2 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/11,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">SMA type 1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SMA type 1 is also known as infantile spinal muscular atrophy or Werdnig-Hoffmann disease. It typically presents after birth but before age six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Affected infants may appear normal before the onset of symptoms, but soon develop a severe, symmetric flaccid paralysis and never achieve the ability to sit unsupported. Because the upper cranial nerves are mostly spared, patients with SMA type 1 usually have an alert expression, furrowed brow, and normal eye movements. However, weakness of the bulbar muscles results in a weak cry, poor suck and swallow reflexes, pooling of secretions, tongue fasciculations, and an increased risk of aspiration and failure to thrive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Respiratory muscle weakness leads to progressive respiratory failure. The intercostal muscles typically are more affected than the diaphragm, resulting in paradoxical breathing (inspiratory efforts cause the rib cage to move inward and the abdomen to move outward) and the development of a characteristic bell-shaped chest deformity. The severe hypotonic leg weakness often manifests as a &quot;frog-leg&quot; posture when lying. Cardiac muscle does not appear to be affected, since SMA is not associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. </p><p>Symptoms progress rapidly, and the majority of infants die before two years of age from respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. Nevertheless, long-term survivors have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. This is perhaps due, in part, to advances in the care of chronic respiratory insufficiency and to more aggressive care. (See <a href=\"#H2162263819\" class=\"local\">'Supportive therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with SMA type 1 generally have two or three copies of the SMN2 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/11,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3201265395\"><span class=\"h2\">SMA type 2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SMA type 2 (intermediate form; Dubowitz disease) accounts for approximately 20 percent of cases and has a less severe course than type 1. SMA type 2 most often presents between 3 and 15 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/1,16,25,42,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16,25,42,44</a>]. The ability to sit unassisted is attained at some point but may be delayed. However, independent standing and walking is never achieved. Weakness is predominately proximal and affects the legs more than the arms. Common features include sparing of face and eye muscles, tongue atrophy with fasciculations, areflexia, a fine tremor-like form of myoclonus (minipolymyoclonus) affecting distal limbs, dysphagia, and respiratory insufficiency. Muscular weakness leads to progressive scoliosis in nearly all affected individuals; the combination of respiratory muscle weakness and scoliosis may result in restrictive lung disease. Some develop joint contractures and ankylosis of the mandible. The ability to sit independently is usually lost in the teenage years. Life expectancy is variable; one report found that about two-thirds of individuals with SMA type 2 were alive at age 25 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Patients with SMA type 2 generally have three copies of the SMN2 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/11,16,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16,45,46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2489352380\"><span class=\"h2\">SMA type 3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SMA type 3 (juvenile form; Kugelberg-Welander disease) accounts for approximately 30 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/1,16,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16,25</a>]. Onset usually occurs between age 18 months and adulthood. Affected individuals achieve independent ambulation. Presenting symptoms are usually a reflection of proximal weakness affecting the legs more than the arms, such as falls and trouble climbing stairs. Many lose the ability to stand or walk independently with time and progression of weakness, becoming wheelchair dependent. Ambulatory patients may develop foot deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, most do not develop scoliosis or debilitating respiratory muscle weakness. SMA type 3 is associated with a normal lifespan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Patients with SMA type 3 generally have three or four copies of the SMN2 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/11,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4023947422\"><span class=\"h2\">SMA type 4</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SMA type 4 (late onset) accounts for less than five percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/16,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,25</a>]. Age of onset is not strictly defined; some experts use onset at age &ge;30 years to separate SMA type 4 from SMA type 3, and others accept juvenile onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/16,42,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,42,48</a>]. SMA type 4 is on the mild end of the SMA spectrum; all motor milestones are achieved, ambulation is usually maintained throughout life, and lifespan is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/1,49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,49-51</a>]. Patients with SMA type 4 generally have four to eight copies of the SMN2 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/11,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of SMA should be suspected for any infant with unexplained weakness or hypotonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Additional clues suggesting the diagnosis in infants, children, or adults include a history of motor difficulties, loss of motor skills, proximal muscle weakness, hyporeflexia or areflexia, tongue fasciculations, and signs of lower motor neuron disease on examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Molecular genetic testing with targeted mutation analysis can confirm the diagnosis of SMA by detection of homozygous deletions of exons 7 of the SMN1 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/1,25,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25,32</a>]. The exon 7 deletion is by far the most common mutation in SMA, but point mutations also occur. Thus, sequencing of the SMN1 gene to look for a point mutation should be pursued if the diagnosis is typical of SMA and only a single deletion is identified.</p><p>Absence of a pathogenic mutation in SMN1 casts serious doubt on the diagnosis. In this situation, it is imperative to consider other conditions in the differential diagnosis (eg, spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Electromyography and muscle biopsy were once a standard part of the diagnostic evaluation for SMA, but are seldom needed now that molecular genetic testing is widely available. Electromyography in SMA shows abnormal spontaneous activity with fibrillations and positive sharp waves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. The mean duration and amplitude of motor unit action potentials are increased, and many are polyphasic. Muscle biopsy reveals large groups of circular atrophic type 1 and 2 muscle fibers interspersed among fascicles of hypertrophied type 1 fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The enlarged fibers have been reinnervated by the sprouting of surviving nerves and are three to four times larger than normal. Histologic diagnosis may be more difficult to make in the newborn infant because only widespread atrophy of muscle fibers may be seen, but a later repeat biopsy usually demonstrates the mixture of hypertrophied and atrophic fibers seen after reinnervation occurs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of SMA varies according to the age of onset.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1743070420\"><span class=\"h2\">Onset from prenatal to six months of age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for prenatal and neonatal SMA (types 0 and 1) includes other causes of floppy (hypotonic) infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-muscular-atrophy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Affected children frequently have varying degrees of mild cognitive impairment. Muscle weakness affects the proximal before the distal limb muscles. Additional features include cardiomyopathy and conduction abnormalities, bone fractures, and scoliosis. Physical examination reveals pseudohypertrophy of the calf and (occasionally) quadriceps muscles, lumbar lordosis, a waddling gait, shortening of the Achilles tendons, and hyporeflexia or areflexia.

Upper motor neuron findings of weakness, hyperreflexia, and spasticity result from degeneration of frontal motor neurons. The lower motor neuron findings of weakness, atrophy or amyotrophy, and fasciculations are a direct consequence of degeneration of lower motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord. Asymmetric limb weakness is the most common presentation of ALS (80 percent). Bulbar onset, usually manifested as dysarthria or dysphagia, is the next most common pattern (20 percent). However, differences in site and segment (cranial, cervical, thoracic, or lumbosacral) of onset, pattern and speed of spread, and the degree of upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction produce a disorder that is remarkably variable between individuals.

Thus, longer survival in the later time period appears to be related to more aggressive care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and motor nuclei in the lower brainstem, which results in progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. The inheritance pattern of the common forms of SMA is autosomal recessive. These forms are caused by biallelic deletions or mutations in the SMN1 gene on chromosome 5q13. The differences in SMN protein and phenotypic expression appear to be related in part to a modifying gene (SMN2) that lies close to the SMN1 gene (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F112225\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112225 \">figure 1</a>). The rare non-5q spinal muscular atrophies, such as X-linked infantile spinal muscular atrophy, are genetically and clinically heterogeneous (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73754\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73754 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2096205246\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SMA phenotypes are classified as types 0 through 4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112224\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112224 \">table 2</a>) depending upon the age of onset and clinical course (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>SMA type 0 designates prenatal onset of SMA, which presents at birth with severe weakness and hypotonia, and often with areflexia. No motor milestones are achieved. Death occurs from respiratory failure by age six months, and usually by one month. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>SMA type 1 (infantile spinal muscular atrophy or Werdnig-Hoffmann disease) typically presents after birth but before age six months. Symptoms progress rapidly, and the majority of infants die before two years of age from respiratory failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>SMA type 2 (intermediate form) and SMA type 3 (Kugelberg-Welander disease) have a less severe course. SMA type 2 presents between 3 and 15 months of age. SMA type 3 typically presents from 18 months of age until adulthood and progresses to a chronic course.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>SMA type 4 is notable for adult onset and is the mildest form.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with all forms of SMA have diffuse symmetric proximal muscle weakness that is greater in the lower than upper limbs and absent or markedly decreased deep tendon reflexes. Infants with SMA type 1 have a severe symmetric flaccid paralysis and are unable to sit unsupported. All SMA types, particularly SMA type 1, may be associated with restrictive lung disease. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Molecular genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis in infants and children with suspected SMA by detection of homozygous deletions of exons 7 of the SMN1 gene. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of SMA is broad and varies according to age of onset. For infantile SMA (types 0 and 1), the differential includes other causes of floppy infants. Of particular importance are the following conditions (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>X-linked infantile spinal muscular atrophy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other neuromuscular disorders (eg, congenital myasthenic syndromes, congenital myopathies, hypoxic-ischemic myelopathy, traumatic myelopathy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Multisystem disorders causing muscle weakness and hypotonia (eg, lysosomal acid maltase deficiency, Prader-Willi syndrome, Zellweger syndrome)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For onset between six months of age through childhood, the differential of SMA involves a number of neuromuscular conditions. Examples include Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, rare non-5q spinal muscular atrophies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73754\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73754 \">table 1</a>), and late onset hexosaminidase A deficiency. Additional considerations for patients with adult-onset disease include later-onset neuromuscular disorders, particularly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and X-linked spinobulbar muscular atrophy. (See <a href=\"#H1645847409\" class=\"local\">'Onset six months to childhood'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1925684664\" class=\"local\">'Adult onset'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment for SMA has been mainly supportive and directed at providing nutrition and respiratory assistance as needed, and treating or preventing complications of weakness. (See <a href=\"#H2162263819\" class=\"local\">'Supportive therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease-modifying therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nusinersen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nusinersen</a> is approved in the United States and several other regions and countries around the world. For most infants with SMA, we recommend treatment with nusinersen (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For select children ages 2 to 12 years who match criteria for CHERISH trial described above, we suggest treatment with nusinersen (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). There are limited published data on nusinersen in older children, adults, and patients with advanced disease. Because of this, along with the uncertainty regarding potential long-term adverse effects of this therapy, we advise individualized treatment decision in these patients. Affected individuals with SMA and their parents should be referred for genetic counseling.
