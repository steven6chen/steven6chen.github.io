A successful open surgical procedure was defined as complete removal of all stones without leaving any residual stone fragments. Patients with residual calculi were considered a treatment failure.</p><p>However, the introduction of less invasive procedures for the management of nephrolithiasis has resulted in a change in treatment goals. With these modalities, residual stone material is often present post-procedure, particularly if the pre-procedure stone was larger than 5 mm in diameter, and minimal emphasis is often placed on the presence of these residual fragments. Instead, success, as currently defined by some investigators, is determined by fragmentation rates and the size of remaining stone fragments. As an example, small stone fragments, such as those less than 5 mm in size, are considered by some clinicians to be &quot;clinically insignificant.&quot;</p><p>Several studies, however, have noted a dramatic increase in stone formation with the presence of residual calculi following SWL or PNL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-residual-stone-fragments-following-stone-removal/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. As a result, it is not acceptable to use the term &quot;clinically insignificant stone fragments,&quot; since residual fragments may act as a nidus for further stone formation.</p><p>The clinical significance of residual fragments following stone removal will be reviewed here. Detailed discussions of the methods and indications for stone removal are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Options in the management of renal and ureteral stones in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RESIDUAL FRAGMENTS FOLLOWING STONE REMOVAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A high incidence of stone growth has been found among patients with residual calculi after shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) or other treatment modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-residual-stone-fragments-following-stone-removal/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. Based upon this observation, various algorithms and neural networks have been created to help predict the incidence of residual stones following lithotripsy treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-residual-stone-fragments-following-stone-removal/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Residual fragments following SWL or percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) lead to high rates of symptomatic episodes, as well as high rates of repeat intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-residual-stone-fragments-following-stone-removal/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. The incidence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rates of recurrent disease vary with the type of stone, size of fragment, and procedure.</p><p>The following studies illustrate the range of published findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent stone fragments are particularly important in patients with struvite (infection) stones. In one series with a mean follow-up of 27 months, 16 of 20 kidneys that were free of stones at three months after SWL remained without stones; by comparison, 14 of 18 kidneys with residual stone particles at three months showed disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-residual-stone-fragments-following-stone-removal/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of struvite or staghorn calculi&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of 160 patients with residual nonstruvite stone fragments smaller than 5 mm in size, the incidence of a symptomatic episode or the requirement for reintervention at two and five years was 43 and 71 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-residual-stone-fragments-following-stone-removal/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, 42 patients with residual stone fragments (most of which were smaller than 5 mm) after PNL were followed for a median of 32 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-residual-stone-fragments-following-stone-removal/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Patients with fragments larger than 2 mm compared with patients whose fragments were 2 mm or less experienced significantly greater numbers of stone-related events (71 versus 24 percent) and required significantly more repeat interventions (53 versus 8 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 658 patients who underwent PNL and received a postoperative computed tomography (CT) on day 1, 45 percent of patients were found to have residual fragments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-residual-stone-fragments-following-stone-removal/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Residual stone fragment larger than 4 mm was associated with higher rates of stone-related events and shorter time to occurrence of stone-related events. The growth and spontaneous passage of residual fragments appeared to be independent of fragment size, emphasizing the importance of obtaining a stone-free status after PNL.</p><p/><p>Given that the presence of residual stone fragments after stone removal increases the risk for future clinical stone disease, all attempts to render a patient completely stone free should be made. It is important to properly image patients two to three months following their stone removal procedures to diagnose the presence of residual stone fragments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-residual-stone-fragments-following-stone-removal/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Moreover, adjunctive medical therapy with a selective alpha blocker (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamsulosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamsulosin</a>) to facilitate passage of residual fragments, a metabolic evaluation to guide selective medical therapy, and continued patient compliance with appropriate clinician follow-up are mandatory to ensure effective prevention of clinical stone disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A metabolic predisposition to stone formation (hypercalciuria, hyperuricosuria, or hypocitraturia) is found in the great majority of patients with calcium stone disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for calcium stones in adults&quot;</a>). Since the metabolic defects underlying stone formation persist after the procedure, the likelihood of recurrent disease among patients with residual calculi after SWL is inextricably linked to the institution of medical therapy (eg, thiazide diuretic and low-salt diet for hypercalciuria, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> or potassium citrate for hyperuricosuria, and potassium citrate for hypocitraturia) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent calcium stones in adults&quot;</a>). Growth of existing stones <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> formation of new calculi due to supersaturation of stone-forming substances <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the lack of stone-inhibitors may be inevitable without appropriate medical therapy.</p><p>Reported benefits vary based upon study design, underlying disorder, compliance with effective therapy, and severity of residual disease. Most trials evaluated treatments that were not specific to abnormalities found in metabolic evaluations (eg, thiazide diuretics in patients with and without hypercalciuria). Nevertheless, findings suggest that comprehensive metabolic evaluation and aggressive medical management may control active stone formation and growth in patients with or without residual stone fragments after SWL and PNL, thereby moderating the need for routine second-look procedures.</p><p>Several randomized trials of medical therapy after an initial surgical intervention have demonstrated efficacy in preventing the recurrence of clinical stone disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-residual-stone-fragments-following-stone-removal/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 100 patients with calcium stones who had residual stone fragments after SWL, patients who were randomly allocated to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> were significantly less likely than those given placebo to have growth of residual stone fragments (18 percent versus 58 percent) or to require repeat SWL (18 percent versus 42 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-residual-stone-fragments-following-stone-removal/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a second trial, 90 patients with calcium oxalate stones who underwent SWL (approximately one-third of whom had residual stone fragments) were randomly assigned to potassium citrate or to no therapy; potassium citrate significantly reduced future clinical stone episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-residual-stone-fragments-following-stone-removal/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The incidence of recurrent clinical stones was also significantly lower among the subset of patients with residual stone fragments (65 versus 78 percent). Similar benefits of potassium citrate were noted in children with residual stone fragments after SWL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-residual-stone-fragments-following-stone-removal/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After SWL, 70 patients with residual fragments post-SWL (30 with sterile calcium and 40 with struvite stones) were randomly assigned to alkalinization therapy with citrate or to hygienic measures only (such as increased fluid intake and avoidance of excessive intake of dairy products) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-residual-stone-fragments-following-stone-removal/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Antibiotics were administered to all patients with infected stones. At one year, alkalinization was associated with a greater likelihood of being stone free in patients with calcium stones (74 versus 32 percent) and also in patients with struvite stones (86 versus 40 percent).</p><p/><p>Benefits with medical therapy have also been noted in observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-residual-stone-fragments-following-stone-removal/abstract/5,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16</a>]. One uncontrolled study examined the association of selective medical therapy with active stone formation after SWL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-residual-stone-fragments-following-stone-removal/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A full metabolic evaluation was performed in 80 patients (31 who were stone free after SWL and 49 who had residual stone fragments). Although initially prescribed to all patients, only 55 chose to remain on appropriate medical therapy to prevent stones for more than four months. The following observations were made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with residual stone fragments less than 5 mm in diameter, active stone growth was significantly greater among those who had discontinued their medical therapy (55 versus 16 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among those with residual stone fragments, the decline in stone formation rate (SFR) was significantly greater in those continuing with medical therapy (from 1.17 <span class=\"nowrap\">stones/patient</span> per year pre-SWL to 0.00 <span class=\"nowrap\">stones/patient</span> per year post-SWL) compared with those who did not continue medical therapy (from 1.33 <span class=\"nowrap\">stones/patient</span> per year pre-SWL to 0.77 <span class=\"nowrap\">stones/patient</span> per year post-SWL).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In fragment-free patients, medical therapy after SWL was associated with a significantly reduced SFR from 0.67 <span class=\"nowrap\">stones/patient</span> per year pre-SWL to 0.00 <span class=\"nowrap\">stones/patient</span> per year post-SWL. The change in those not taking medical therapy was not significant.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of residual calculi following shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) or percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) is associated with an increased risk of stone formation or stone growth.
