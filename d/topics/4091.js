Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood, accounting for approximately 20 percent of all primary tumors of the central nervous system among children less than 19 years of age. The peak incidence is between five and nine years of age. Approximately 70 percent of patients are diagnosed before the age of 20. There is a slight increase in incidence between the ages of 20 to 24 years, and the disease is rare after the fourth decade, consistent with its embryonal origin.</p><p>Approximately 2 to 5 percent of medulloblastomas occur in association with either the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), caused by germline mutations in the patched-1 (<em>PTCH1</em>) gene, or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), caused by inactivating mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (<em>APC)</em> gene. Mutations in these genes predispose to the development of medulloblastoma through defects in pathways important in the pathogenesis of both sporadic and inherited tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histopathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-medulloblastoma#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Histopathology and molecular pathogenesis of medulloblastoma&quot;, section on 'Genetic predisposition'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3171951\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with medulloblastoma present with a combination of signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure and cerebellar dysfunction evolving over a period of weeks to a few months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) typically demonstrates a midline or paramedian cerebellar mass that enhances after contrast administration, and approximately one third of patients will have evidence of tumor dissemination through the subarachnoid space either by imaging or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medulloblastomas most commonly present with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, including nocturnal or morning headaches, nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status. Tumors in the midline may cause gait ataxia or truncal instability, whereas tumors in the lateral cerebellar hemispheres are more likely to cause limb clumsiness or incoordination. Dizziness and double vision are common symptoms that can be caused by cerebellar, brainstem, or cranial nerve involvement. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3171959\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurologic exam findings depend upon the location of the tumor within the posterior fossa. Patients with midline tumors typically exhibit truncal or gait ataxia, manifested by a broad-based gait or difficulty with heel-to-toe walking. Head titubation (bobbing) and nystagmus are also common. Patients with lateral cerebellar tumors may exhibit dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing, intention tremor, and difficulty with heel-to-shin testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=detailed-neurologic-assessment-of-infants-and-children#H10930531\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Detailed neurologic assessment of infants and children&quot;, section on 'Coordination'</a>.) </p><p>Cranial nerve deficits may occur in conjunction with these signs, either from direct involvement of specific nerves or from cranial nerve dysfunction due to increased intracranial pressure. As an example, elevated intracranial pressure can induce dysfunction of the abducens nerves, causing diplopia especially with lateral gaze. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=detailed-neurologic-assessment-of-infants-and-children#H10929015\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Detailed neurologic assessment of infants and children&quot;, section on 'Cranial nerves'</a>.) </p><p>Prolonged elevation of intracranial pressure can lead to papilledema and complete or partial loss of vision. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of elevated intracranial pressure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3172044\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals a contrast-enhancing midline or paramedian cerebellar tumor which often compresses the fourth ventricle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55787\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55787 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-risk-stratification-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Most tumors are iso- or hypointense on T1-weighted images and heterogeneous on T2-weighted images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-risk-stratification-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Gadolinium enhancement is often heterogeneous, and there may be regions of necrosis, hemorrhage, or cystic changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-risk-stratification-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. Hydrocephalus may be present secondary to obstruction at the level of the fourth ventricle. </p><p>Enhancing nodules or more linear patterns of enhancement may be evident in the ventricles, over the surface of the brain, or in the spinal canal, indicative of leptomeningeal dissemination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87762\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87762 \">image 2</a>). In cases of spinal involvement, MRI typically shows linear or nodule enhancement along the pial surface of the spinal cord <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> drop metastases within the cauda equina. &#160;</p><p>Adults are more likely to have cerebellar hemisphere tumors than are children, and the desmoplastic variant, which is more common in adults, may lack uniform contrast enhancement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-risk-stratification-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Medulloblastomas may be missed on computed tomography (CT) scan. The classic CT finding is a hyperdense mass on an unenhanced study that markedly enhances after the injection of contrast medium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-risk-stratification-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3172051\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebrospinal fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately one-third of medulloblastomas metastasize throughout the central nervous system following cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) pathways. In these cases, cytopathologic examination of the CSF may reveal neoplastic cells. Elevated protein and a mild pleocytosis are often seen in association with a positive cytology, but these findings are nonspecific.</p><p>A positive CSF cytology either pre- or postoperatively predicts for an increased rate of relapse and poor outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-risk-stratification-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, negative cytology does not exclude a more advanced stage of disease. Lumbar puncture must be delayed until after surgery in the majority of patients due to the presence of increased intracranial pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> obstructive hydrocephalus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbar-puncture-indications-contraindications-technique-and-complications-in-children#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbar puncture: Indications, contraindications, technique, and complications in children&quot;, section on 'Contraindications'</a> and <a href=\"#H5791882\" class=\"local\">'Extent of disease evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diagnosis of medulloblastoma requires histopathologic confirmation at the time of surgical resection. Biopsies are not routinely performed in patients suspected of having a medulloblastoma by imaging, because maximal safe resection is an integral part of the management of medulloblastoma as well as other posterior fossa tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma#H3177285\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of medulloblastoma&quot;, section on 'Surgery'</a>.)</p><p>The histopathology of medulloblastoma is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histopathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-medulloblastoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Histopathology and molecular pathogenesis of medulloblastoma&quot;, section on 'Histopathology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5791953\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of a posterior fossa mass in a child includes other tumors with a predilection for the cerebellum, the most common of which are pilocytic astrocytoma, ependymoma, and atypical <span class=\"nowrap\">teratoid/rhabdoid</span> tumors (ATRT). While each of these entities is ultimately distinguished from medulloblastoma by findings on surgical pathology, certain imaging findings can help to differentiate among these tumors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pilocytic astrocytomas are typically cystic with a mural nodule or centrally necrotic with a thick rim of enhancing tissue; if cysts are present in medulloblastomas, they are typically small and multiple rather than solitary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-risk-stratification-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ependymomas usually respect the ventricles and may grow to fill the fourth ventricle and extend inferiorly through the foramen of Magendie or laterally through the foramen of Luschka. Foraminal extension has also been reported in medulloblastoma, but is much less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-risk-stratification-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ATRT are much rarer than medulloblastomas but can have a similar appearance on MRI. Compared with medulloblastoma, ATRT are more likely to involve the lateral hemispheres or cerebellopontine angle and contain intratumoral hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-risk-stratification-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p>Advanced MR imaging characteristics are also helpful. Decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, a marker of high cellularity, are characteristic of medulloblastoma and ATRT but not ependymoma or pilocytic astrocytoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-risk-stratification-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p>In an adult with a posterior fossa mass lesion, the differential diagnosis also includes metastatic tumors, which are rare in childhood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5791882\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTENT OF DISEASE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spine MRI and lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology should be performed in all patients as part of the extent of disease evaluation. Medulloblastomas rarely metastasize outside of the nervous system at diagnosis, and therefore systemic staging (eg, computed tomography of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, positron emission tomography [PET], bone scan) is not required at the time of diagnosis.</p><p>The spinal leptomeninges are a frequent site of spread, with involvement at presentation in 20 to 25 percent of patients. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology are used to assess the craniospinal axis for evidence of tumor dissemination; the combination of both tests is more sensitive than either one individually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-risk-stratification-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In one study, 34 out of 106 patients with medulloblastoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) had evidence of leptomeningeal dissemination at diagnosis; of these, 21 patients had discordant MRI and cytology results, including nine patients with positive MRI but negative CSF cytology and 12 patients with positive CSF cytology but negative MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-risk-stratification-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Many patients are not candidates for a lumbar puncture prior to surgery due to the extent of disease in the posterior fossa. If CSF cytology is not obtained preoperatively, it is important to wait two weeks to avoid potential contamination of the specimen with surgical debris. Similarly, the interpretation of a spinal MRI obtained soon after surgery may be difficult due to the challenge of distinguishing between subdural blood products and drop metastases. Therefore, spine MRI should be performed preoperatively (ideally) or delayed for two weeks if performed postoperatively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3172565\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK STRATIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is an evolving understanding of prognostic factors and risk stratification in medulloblastoma. Historically, the most important factors affecting outcome have been the extent of disease and the age of the patient at diagnosis. Additional studies have highlighted the importance of both molecular markers and histopathology in determining prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-risk-stratification-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>], and these may form the basis for better pretreatment risk stratification.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3172572\"><span class=\"h2\">Extent of disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The modified Chang criteria, which are based upon the size of the primary tumor and the extent of nervous system and extraneural spread, are useful in estimating prognosis, which is progressively worse in the presence of more advanced disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73044\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73044 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-risk-stratification-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The importance of the presence of metastases was illustrated in a trial of 188 children with medulloblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-risk-stratification-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients without metastatic disease (M0) had a significantly higher five-year progression-free survival (PFS) (70 percent versus 57 percent with M1 and 40 percent with M2, M3, or M4 disease). Similar results were noted in a second series of 173 consecutive patients with medulloblastoma, 84 percent of whom were less than 15 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-risk-stratification-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The five-year survival of those with M0 or M1 disease was 78 percent compared to 21 percent in patients with M2 or M3 involvement.</p><p>Extraneural metastases are rare. In a review of the literature that identified 119 patients with M4 disease, the median age was 16 years, and the median time to diagnosis after initial presentation was 16 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-risk-stratification-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Bone was the most common site of extraneural disease and was present in 84 percent of cases. In approximately one-half of patients, CNS involvement was present at the time of extraneural relapse. Negative prognostic factors included the presence of lung or liver metastases, the presence of CNS disease, and a shorter interval between original diagnosis and the development of these metastases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3172579\"><span class=\"h2\">Age at diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relationship between age and outcome in medulloblastoma is nonlinear, with patients at the extremes of the age distribution (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">infants/young</span> children and adults) fairing worse than those in the middle.</p><p>Young age at diagnosis has a negative impact on both long-term survival and quality of life in survivors. Children younger than age five years with medulloblastoma, and particularly those younger than three, have a significantly poorer prognosis. This was illustrated by one series, in which the estimated five-year progression-free survival was 32 percent in children between age 1.5 and three years versus 58 percent in those three and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-risk-stratification-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Reduction or elimination of radiation in very young children, necessitated by the toxicity of radiation to the developing nervous system, may contribute to their overall poor prognosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma#H3177341\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of medulloblastoma&quot;, section on 'Infants and young children'</a>.)</p><p>The natural history and response to treatment of medulloblastoma may differ in older as compared to younger children. In a retrospective review of 72 patients between the ages of 10 and 20 years at the time of diagnosis, five-year overall and event-free survival rates of 78 and 70 percent, respectively, were similar to those observed in younger children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-risk-stratification-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, relapses were often delayed, with a mean time to relapse of three years. Furthermore, treatment in this older cohort was associated with frequent severe toxicity, including ototoxicity (45 percent), peripheral neuropathy (71 percent), hematologic toxicity (95 percent), and weight loss (73 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3172586\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The World Health Organization classification of brain tumors divides medulloblastoma based upon histopathologic criteria into several variants, including classic, <span class=\"nowrap\">desmoplastic/nodular,</span> desmoplastic with extensive nodularity, large cell, or anaplastic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F109467\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109467 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histopathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-medulloblastoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Histopathology and molecular pathogenesis of medulloblastoma&quot;, section on 'Histopathology'</a>.)</p><p>Histopathology is an important prognostic factor, particularly in young children. The impact of histopathology was studied in a cohort of 260 children less than five years of age who were treated on national protocols in Europe and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-risk-stratification-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Even after accounting for stage (presence of metastases, residual disease), patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">desmoplastic/nodular</span> or desmoplastic with extensive nodularity had a significantly better event-free and overall survival compared with the classic form of medulloblastoma on multivariate analysis. In contrast, those with large cell or anaplastic variants had a significantly poorer prognosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3172593\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Analysis of molecular features in medulloblastoma offers important insights into the prognosis, and may provide opportunities to individualize treatment for patients with medulloblastoma. Integrative genomic studies suggest that medulloblastoma can be divided into four molecular subgroups, which have divergent cell histology, genetics, clinical behavior, and patient outcomes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F87770\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87770 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-risk-stratification-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/14-16,22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16,22-26</a>]. </p><p>Tumors that show activation of the Wingless (WNT) pathway have the best prognosis, whereas tumors with amplification of the <em>MYC</em> proto-oncogene (&ldquo;group 3&rdquo;) have the worst prognosis. Tumors with activation of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway and those in group 4 have an intermediate prognosis, with the exception of SHH tumors containing TP53 mutations, which are associated with a particularly poor prognosis. This is described in more detail separately.
