They may, however, need advice for more unusual events. Although it is not possible to cover all eventualities, some general guidelines can be given.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EATING OUT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maintenance of strict glycemic control with intensive insulin therapy is facilitated by relative consistency in the quantity and timing of carbohydrate intake. These may be difficult to anticipate when going to a restaurant or eating at a friend's house. It is helpful to keep a carbohydrate supply on hand, to check blood glucose frequently (if not using continuous glucose monitoring), and to learn to estimate (visually or by asking the chef) the carbohydrate content in the meal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Case 1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 41-year-old man, whose diabetes is usually well controlled (glycated hemoglobin [A1C] of 5.5 percent), takes 8 units of regular and 18 units of NPH before breakfast, 4 units of regular before lunch, 8 units of regular before his evening meal, and 10 units of NPH before bedtime. One evening, after a busy day at work, he is invited to dinner with friends. Dinner will not be served until about 8:30 PM, although he usually eats his evening meal at approximately 5:45 PM. His blood glucose values for that day were 106 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> before breakfast, 112 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (6.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> before lunch, and 68 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> at 5:30 PM.</p><p>Because of the relatively low blood glucose values, he eats a snack, ingesting the same amount of food as his usual bedtime snack (30 g). At 8:15 PM, after arriving at the party, his blood glucose is 137 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. This seems to be a reasonable value and he decides to take his usual pre-evening meal dose of insulin (8 units of regular). When he gets home at 11 PM, having eaten more than usual, his blood glucose is 362 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (20.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. He wonders what to do now.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient has done quite well so far. He should take his usual dose of NPH (10 units) plus an extra dose of regular (perhaps 4 units) to correct the hyperglycemia. With the advantage of hindsight, he should have taken more than his usual dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a> before the meal or eaten less. Depending upon how well he knew the hosts, he might have asked what was going to be served so that he could have made a better guess as to the appropriate insulin dose. If the patient is taught detailed carbohydrate counting, including carbohydrate-to-insulin ratios, his ability to estimate how much extra regular insulin to take would improve. The use of insulin pens and rapid-acting analogs (such as lispro insulin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-aspart-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin aspart</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glulisine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin glulisine</a>) have made eating out more convenient. Although not recommended for usual care, when necessary it is possible to take the rapid-acting analog immediately after finishing the meal, basing the dose on the pre-meal blood glucose level plus the amount of carbohydrate that has been eaten.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTIVE MINOR SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some minor surgery is performed in the fasting state. This is a potential problem for patients receiving intensive insulin therapy in whom fasting will predispose to intraoperative hypoglycemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Case 2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 20-year-old man with type 1 diabetes requires elective oral surgery for extraction of wisdom teeth at 8 AM the next day. He has been told to come in fasting, and the procedure will be done under local anesthesia. His usual insulin regimen is 14 units of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin glargine</a> in the morning and a variable dose of lispro based on his carbohydrate intake (1 unit for every 20 grams of carbohydrate plus a correction factor of 1 unit for every 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> that his pre-meal blood glucose is above 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>. His fasting blood glucose average for the past 14 days has been 138 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. He asks for advice on how to prepare for surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient should take his usual dose of 14 units of glargine but no lispro on the morning of his surgery. After the procedure is over and he feels well enough to eat (which is likely to be later that same morning), he should check his glucose and use his usual calculations to cover his lunch based on the amount of carbohydrate he is about to eat and what his pre-meal blood glucose is. The meal can consist of liquids or soft food but should supply an amount of carbohydrate equivalent to his usual lunch. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of blood glucose in adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Type 1 or insulin-treated type 2 diabetes'</a>.)</p><p>Although he has been told to fast, he should carry fast-acting carbohydrate (such as glucose tablets or hard candies) with him in case his blood glucose drops to hypoglycemic levels before the procedure begins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPENDING DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild infections (such as a cold, sore throat, or urinary tract infection) can, via the release of stress hormones, cause persistent hyperglycemia and some ketonuria. The clinician can often manage this problem over the telephone if the patient is reliable and well educated, with frequent monitoring of blood glucose and urine ketones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Case 3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 24-year-old woman, who has had type 1 diabetes for nine years, has sudden deterioration of her diabetic control in association with an intercurrent flu-like illness. Her usual regimen is 6 units of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-aspart-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin aspart</a> and 12 units of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin glargine</a> before breakfast, 6 units of aspart before the evening meal, and 10 units of glargine at bedtime. She awakens with a blood glucose value of 375 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (20.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and trace ketones in the urine. She has some myalgias, a slight cough, and a temperature of 99.6&deg;F. She does not feel hungry but is not nauseated. She decides to stay home from work. Over the telephone, the diabetic nurse specialist tells her to take her usual morning dose of 12 units of glargine plus an extra 8 units of insulin aspart (14 units in all) and to drink at least two to three cups of water or diet soft drink every hour.</p><p>She checks her blood glucose and tests her urine for ketones every hour; she also contacts a member of the diabetes team every one to two hours. She is told that, even though her blood glucose is high, she should take in some carbohydrate (perhaps 150 grams) during the day. This can be achieved by drinking fruit juice in addition to sipping plain water or diet soft drinks. However, her blood glucose remains above 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (16.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> all morning, she develops moderate ketonuria, and she is unable to maintain her fluid intake because of uncontrolled nausea and vomiting. As a result, prompt arrangements are made for her to come to the emergency department. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-ketoacidosis-and-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state-in-adults-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in adults: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-ketoacidosis-and-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state-in-adults-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in adults: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although ultimately unsuccessful in this patient, it is often possible to manage mild &quot;pre-diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)&quot; with the patient at home and calling in frequently. A reasonable general guideline is to add up the total units of insulin for a typical day (34 units in this case), divide this value by 4, and give this quantity of regular or rapid-acting insulin every four to six hours <strong>in addition</strong> to the patient's usual insulin regimen. This approach is worth trying with reliable, motivated patients, especially if there is someone at home to help. Success is also dependent upon the patient being able to maintain an adequate fluid intake. An antiemetic (such as a compazine suppository) may be helpful in patients with nausea and vomiting. If oral intake is still limited, the patient should be brought to the emergency department or doctor's office for intravenous fluid replacement and further evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9235409\"><span class=\"h2\">Case 4</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 42-year-old man has had type 1 diabetes for 20 years and has been using a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) pump for the past five years with great success using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-aspart-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin aspart</a> (most recent glycated hemoglobin [A1C] is 6.4 percent with very few hypoglycemic episodes). His basal rate is 1.1 units per hour from 2 to 10 AM and 0.9 units per hour from 10 AM to 2 AM. His usual pre-meal bolus is 1 unit for every 10 grams of carbohydrate at breakfast and lunch and 1 unit for every 15 grams of carbohydrate before his evening meal. At all three meals, his correction factor is 1 unit for every 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> that his pre-meal blood glucose is above 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>.</p><p>After a stressful day at work, he goes to bed at 9 PM. He awakes at 5 AM the next morning after a fitful sleep feeling thirsty, with a headache, and bursting to urinate. He realizes that sometime during the night, the insertion of his pump catheter has become dislodged from the skin of his abdomen and is lying loose in the bedclothes. His blood glucose is 494 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. Although tired and slightly nauseous, he is alert and is able to drink three large glasses of water and keep them down. He has moderate urine ketones. He calls his pump team to ask advice on what to do.</p><p>The patient is told to prepare a fresh insulin infusion set and insert that in a new location on his abdomen. He should set the basal rate at 2.0 units per hour and give himself a bolus of 10 units of aspart right away. He is told to drink at least two large glasses of water every hour and check his blood glucose every hour and to call back in three hours. At 8 AM, his blood glucose is down to 346 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and he has only trace ketones in his urine. He takes another bolus of 8 units of aspart and continues to drink water and check his blood glucose hourly. By 11 AM, his blood glucose is 197 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> with a trace of ketonuria. His headache is gone, and he feels well enough to eat something. He is told to reduce his basal rate back to 0.9 units per hour and to use his usual formula to calculate his lunchtime bolus. He has a large bowl of soup and two pieces of bread for a total of 60 grams of carbohydrate, so he takes a total of 9 units of aspart to cover this. By that evening he feels back to normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9235416\"><span class=\"h3\">Interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although CSII is a very effective and flexible way for motivated patients with type 1 diabetes to achieve excellent glycemic control, because they take no long-acting insulin (relying instead on a continuous infusion of rapid-acting insulin), they are at risk if the flow of rapid-acting insulin is interrupted. When the catheter gets dislodged, the patient's plasma insulin level will drop to undetectable levels over the next few hours, resulting in the development of hyperglycemia and ketosis. Patients using CSII should have some long-acting insulin (such as glargine or detemir) on hand to use if their pump has a major malfunction. In a case like this one, however, where the pump is functioning correctly but the catheter became dislodged and where the patient does not have an intercurrent illness and is alert and feeling well enough to keep fluids down, the situation can be managed at home using an approach like the one described here.</p><p>This patient's usual total basal rate for 24 hours is 23.2 units. An alternative would have been to ask him to take 12 units of his long-acting insulin plus the bolus of 10 units of aspart at 5 AM, but to keep his pump basal rate at its usual level for that time of day. If there is any concern regarding whether the pump is functioning correctly, the pump should be disconnected and both basal insulin, such as glargine, and rapid-acting insulin should be given by injection with a syringe or pen. (In general, the full 24-hour basal insulin should be given as a single injection of long-acting insulin and then approximately 10 units of rapid acting insulin approximately every four hours until blood glucose levels are falling into the 200 range, and urine ketones have cleared.) Finally, if there is any concern regarding the reliability of the patient to follow these suggestions or the ability to maintain frequent contact with the patient during the episode, the safest course is to have the patient travel immediately to the closest emergency department for treatment.
