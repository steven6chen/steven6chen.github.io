Toxocariasis occurs as a result of human infection with the larvae of the dog ascarid, <em>Toxocara canis</em>, or, less commonly, the cat ascarid, <em>Toxocara cati</em>. Another form of VLM is caused by human ingestion of eggs of the pig ascarid, <em>Ascaris suum</em>. Clinical presentations consist of VLM and ocular larva migrans (OLM); infection may also be subclinical.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toxocariasis occurs worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Infection tends to occur more frequently in tropical regions than in temperate regions and more frequently among rural populations than urban populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. <em>Toxocara</em> larvae can develop at temperatures &lt;50&deg;F, although efficiency decreases as the temperature decreases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In the United States, the seroprevalence of <em>Toxocara</em> has been estimated at 13.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; rates are increased among individuals living in poverty and among certain minority groups (especially African Americans) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Prevalence rates of 40 percent or more have been reported in Indonesia and Brazil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24389847\"><span class=\"h2\">Life cycle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The life cycle of <em>Toxocara canis</em> occurs in dogs and the life cycle of <em>Toxocara cati</em> occurs in cats; the prevalence of <em>Toxocara </em>infection is highest among puppies and kittens. In North America, it is estimated that about 5 percent of dogs and puppies are infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Humans acquire the infection as accidental hosts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F51830\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51830 \">figure 1</a>). Eggs are shed in the stool of the definitive host. In the environment, eggs embryonate and become infective after about three weeks. Soil contamination with infectious eggs occurs most readily in relatively warm climates, and these embryonated eggs can remain infective in the environment for several years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Following ingestion of infective eggs by dogs or cats, the eggs hatch and larvae (0.5 mm in length) penetrate the gut wall. The larvae then migrate through the lungs, bronchial tree, and enter the esophagus; adult worms develop in the small intestine, where they lay eggs that are shed in the stool.</p><p>In most older animals, larvae penetrate the gut wall and, subsequently, larvae encyst in tissues. Encysted larvae can reactivate in female dogs during late pregnancy and infect puppies via transplacental and transmammary routes; adult worms can subsequently become established in the small intestines of puppies.</p><p><em>Toxocara</em> can also be transmitted through ingestion of paratenic hosts (a host that is not required for the parasite life cycle but nonetheless can serve to maintain the life cycle). Eggs ingested by small non-canine mammals (such as rabbits) can hatch and larvae can penetrate the gut wall with subsequent migration into various tissues where they encyst. The life cycle is completed when dogs eat larvae encysted in the tissues of these paratenic hosts and the larvae develop into egg-laying adult worms in the small intestine.</p><p>Humans are accidental hosts who become infected by ingesting infective eggs in contaminated soil or encysted larvae in the tissues of infected paratenic hosts. Direct contact with infected puppies and kittens is not classically considered to be a risk factor for human infection since the eggs must embryonate before becoming infective, although sometimes pets carry embryonated eggs in their fur. Following ingestion, the eggs hatch and larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and are carried by the circulation to a variety of tissues (liver, heart, lungs, brain, muscle, eyes). The larvae do not undergo any further development in these sites, but the host inflammatory response against the migrating larvae can cause both mechanical and immunopathological damage to tissues, which leads to local reactions that are the basis of clinical toxocariasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24389861\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission and risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals who ingest embryonated eggs in soil are at risk for developing infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Infection can also be acquired via ingestion of raw liver or other undercooked meat from an infected intermediate host (rabbit, chicken, cattle, or swine) containing encapsulated larvae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Visceral larva migrans is principally a disease of young children, especially those with exposure to playgrounds and sandboxes contaminated by dog or cat feces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>]. Having a dog as a pet is a recognized risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]; however, infection is often acquired in settings outside of the home (such as in public parks and playgrounds) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p><em>Toxocara </em>infection does occur in travelers, but the incidence is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic infection to severe organ injury; they occur as a consequence of damage caused by migrating larvae in addition to the host eosinophilic granulomatous response. Migration of larvae can cause eosinophilic infiltration, granuloma formation, or eosinophilic abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p><em>Toxocara</em> spp larvae are unable to grow or replicate in the human host, but parasites can remain viable for at least seven years after infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Most infections are self-limited as larvae become encapsulated (usually in the musculature and liver).</p><p>There are two major categories of clinical manifestations: visceral larva migrans (VLM) and ocular larva migrans (OLM). These have also been reported to occur simultaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18545296\"><span class=\"h2\">Visceral larva migrans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VLM occurs most commonly in young children and results in hepatitis and pneumonitis as the larvae migrate through the liver and lungs, respectively. Heavy infection may result in fever, anorexia, malaise, irritability, hepatomegaly, respiratory symptoms, pruritic urticaria-like cutaneous lesions, and eosinophilia.</p><p>Larvae frequently localize in the liver; hepatic manifestations may include hepatomegaly or nodular lesions. Pulmonary involvement may cause dyspnea, wheezing, and a chronic nonproductive cough in 20 to 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Rales are common on physical examination. The chest radiograph demonstrates abnormalities in &ge;40 percent of patients with symptomatic illness. Bilateral peribronchial infiltration is most common; parenchymal infiltrates can also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Computed tomography (CT) may demonstrate multifocal subpleural nodules with halo or ground-glass opacities and ill-defined margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Severe respiratory tract involvement is an uncommon complication of heavy infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Toxocariasis can be mistaken for metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]; the presence of eosinophilia and radiologic findings may be helpful differentiating features. (See <a href=\"#H17922979\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Larvae can also travel via the systemic circulation to muscles, the heart, the eye, or the central nervous system (CNS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Cardiac involvement in <em>Toxocara </em>spp infection is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication. The clinical presentation may consist of myocarditis, pericarditis, or Loeffler endocarditis (eosinophilic myocarditis); heart failure or cardiac tamponade can occur and can be fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endomyocardial-fibrosis#H15162944\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endomyocardial fibrosis&quot;, section on 'Eosinophilia'</a>.)</p><p>Manifestations of the CNS include eosinophilic meningo-encephalitis, space-occupying lesions, myelitis, and cerebral vasculitis causing seizures. Manifestations of the peripheral nervous system include radiculitis, affection of cranial nerves, or musculoskeletal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Death due to myocardial or CNS involvement has been described but is rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18545304\"><span class=\"h2\">Ocular larva migrans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OLM involvement may occur as the sole manifestation of VLM; it often presents in individuals without antecedent history of symptomatic VLM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. OLM occurs most commonly among older children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In one review of ocular toxocariasis in the United States, the median patient age was 8.5 years (range 1 to 60 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The ocular lesion is due to larval localization in the eye and the granulomatous response around the larva. Common symptoms are unilateral visual impairment, causing failing vision and subsequent strabismus. The typical lesion is a whitish elevated granuloma. Occasionally, OLM may present as uveitis, papillitis, or endophthalmitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Ocular lesions may resemble retinoblastoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F102609\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102609 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The most serious consequence of infection is invasion of the retina with granuloma formation in the periphery or posterior pole, leading to dragging of the retina and eventual retinal detachment, which can lead to blindness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>OLM is discussed further separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-leukocoria#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with leukocoria&quot;, section on 'Toxocariasis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18545786\"><span class=\"h2\">Other presentations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Toxocara</em> can also present with other manifestations. Mild infection may present with eosinophilia only. Other symptoms may include fever, headache, behavioral disturbances, anorexia, abdominal pain, rash, hepatomegaly, nausea, vomiting, as well as wheezing and pulmonary infiltrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/12,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,32</a>].</p><p>Wheezing and pulmonary infiltrates, together with eosinophilia, are also the hallmark features of childhood asthma. It has been postulated that the presence of <em>Toxocara</em> larvae in lungs may be an underlying factor in the onset of allergic pulmonary disease, perhaps because of the host response to the parasite; a causal association remains uncertain, as both positive associations and negative epidemiological studies have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. A meta-analysis suggested a significantly higher prevalence of <em>T. canis</em> infection among asthma patients than among controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Cutaneous manifestations are relatively common, either alone, together with eosinophilia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in conjunction with other clinical manifestations of toxocariasis. Chronic urticaria is the most dermatologic manifestation; others include chronic pruritus, transient rash, different forms of eczema, hypodermic nodules, and vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Two additional toxocariasis syndromes have been described: &quot;covert toxocariasis&quot; (seen mainly in children) and &quot;common toxocariasis&quot; (seen predominantly in adults); these are probably variations of the same clinical entity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Covert toxocariasis refers to nonspecific symptoms and signs including fever, abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, hepatomegaly, cough, headache, lethargy, behavioral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sleep disturbances, skin symptoms, limb pains, and lymphadenitis associated with high titers of anti-<em>Toxocara</em> antibodies, with or without eosinophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Common toxocariasis refers to a syndrome comprised of chronic weakness, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, rash, itch, urticarial and arthralgia, often with eosinophilia, high immunoglobulin (Ig)E levels, and high titers of <em>Toxocara</em>-specific antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2369786\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, VLM should be suspected in the setting of compatible clinical manifestations, together with leukocytosis, eosinophilia, and hypergammaglobulinemia (elevated serum levels of IgE, IgG, and IgE). Marked leukocytosis with eosinophilia occurs in more than 30 percent of cases of VLM, and elevated titers of anti-A or anti-B isohemagglutinins are commonly observed in about 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>There is no peripheral blood eosinophilia in most cases of OLM, presumably because of the low larval load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Eosinophilia may also be absent in patients with long-standing infection and in those with cutaneous symptoms only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. An eosinophilic granulomatous hepatitis may develop, leading to abnormalities in liver function tests including elevated transaminases <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alkaline phosphatase.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17922979\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2369831\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antibody assays that detect human immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies to <em>Toxocara</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">excretory/secretory</span> antigens. The test can detect subclinical or mild infection, though it cannot differentiate between <em>T. canis</em> and <em>T. cati</em> infections. The reliability varies by assay and clinical presentation. As an example, for visceral larva migrans (VLM) and some forms of covert toxocariasis, the sensitivity and specificity of the <em>Toxocara</em> enzyme immunoassay (titer 1:32) are estimated at about 78 percent and 92 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/5,12,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12,40,41</a>].</p><p>A positive ELISA result does not necessarily demonstrate the presence of active <em>Toxocara</em> infection or prove that clinical symptoms are attributable to that toxocariasis; the result must be interpreted in the setting of compatible clinical symptoms and epidemiologic exposure. Cross-reactivity of the ELISA assay with other parasite antigens is common, and the test may remain positive for several years even following treatment. In some settings, positive ELISA results can be confirmed by western blot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], which has better sensitivity and specificity compared with ELISA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>] but is also more expensive and labor intensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Definitive diagnosis of VLM may also be established via detection of larvae in biopsy tissue, which will show <em>Toxocara</em> larvae within eosinophilic granulomatous lesions. However, biopsy is rarely indicated.</p><p>The sensitivity of ELISA for ocular larva migrans (OLM) is considerably lower than for VLM; the diagnosis of OLM generally relies on the findings on ophthalmologic examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50062\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50062 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. It is possible to compare the antibody levels between the serum and aqueous humour; if the (level of specific IgG in aqueous <span class=\"nowrap\">humour/level</span> of specific IgG in <span class=\"nowrap\">serum)/(total</span> IgG in aqueous <span class=\"nowrap\">humour/total</span> IgG in serum) is greater than 3.0, this can be considered diagnostic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods for detecting <em>Toxocara</em> in clinical samples have been described but are not commercially available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Methods for detecting circulating antigen are being developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Stool examinations are not helpful since the parasite does not complete a full life cycle involving the human gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>Pulmonary involvement may result in eosinophilia that is detectable in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. One case of marked pulmonary infiltration demonstrated 64 percent eosinophils in the BAL analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>In the setting of central nervous system involvement, the cerebrospinal fluid may show eosinophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Toxocariasis occurs as a result of human infection with the larvae of the dog ascarid, <em>Toxocara canis</em>, or, less commonly, the cat ascarid, <em>Toxocara cati</em>. VLM is principally a disease of young children, especially those with exposure to playgrounds and sandboxes contaminated by dog or cat feces. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The life cycle of <em>Toxocara canis</em> occurs in dogs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F51830\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51830 \">figure 1</a>). Puppies are a major source of environmental egg contamination. Humans are accidental hosts who become infected by ingesting eggs in contaminated soil or encysted larvae in the tissues of infected paratenic hosts. Ingested eggs mature into larvae which penetrate the intestinal wall and are carried by the circulation to a variety of tissues (liver, heart, lungs, brain, muscle, eyes). The larvae can cause severe local reactions at these sites. (See <a href=\"#H24389847\" class=\"local\">'Life cycle'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Larvae frequently localize in the liver; hepatic manifestations may include hepatomegaly or nodular lesions. Mild infection may be asymptomatic and only suspected by the finding of elevated blood eosinophilia. Heavy infection may result in fever, anorexia, malaise, irritability, hepatomegaly, and pruritic urticaria-like cutaneous lesions. Ocular larva migrans (OLM) is due to larval localization in the eye and the granulomatous response around the larva. Common symptoms are unilateral visual impairment and subsequent strabismus; complete visual loss can occur. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VLM should be suspected in the setting of compatible clinical manifestations together with leukocytosis, eosinophilia, and hypergammaglobulinemia (elevated serum levels of immunoglobulin [Ig]E, IgG, and IgE). In the appropriate clinical scenario, the diagnosis can be confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antibody assay, which detects human IgG antibodies to <em>Toxocara</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">excretory/secretory</span> antigens. (See <a href=\"#H2369786\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, individuals with mild symptoms due to toxocariasis may not require anthelminthic therapy as symptoms are usually self-limited. For individuals with moderate to severe symptoms, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albendazole</a> (400 mg orally with fatty meal twice daily for five days) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In cases of severe respiratory, myocardial, or central nervous system involvement, we suggest concomitant treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (0.5 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day)</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Good hygiene practices, timely disposal of pet feces, and routine deworming of pets are important strategies for prevention of toxocariasis in humans.
