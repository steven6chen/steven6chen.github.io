In the mid-point of the anal canal is the dentate line, which is the demarcation between columnar epithelium superiorly and squamous epithelium inferiorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62539 \">figure 1</a>). Along the dentate line lie crypts, which have small glands at their base. The squamous epithelium between the dentate line and anal verge is called &ldquo;anoderm,&rdquo; which is similar to normal skin but highly sensitive, and the squamous epithelium outside the anal verge is the perianal skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H718862511\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1951813971\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of anorectal symptoms in men who have sex with men (MSM) is often suggested by history and physical examination findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F114654\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114654 \">table 1</a>). Patients should be evaluated by obtaining a detailed history, performing an external rectal exam for visible abnormalities (eg, anal warts, hemorrhoids) and performing a digital rectal exam for palpable abnormalities (eg, perianal abscess, rectal mass). In addition, anoscopy is recommended for patients with rectal pain, bleeding, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bloody or purulent discharge and in patients with a palpable abnormality on digital rectal exam (See <a href=\"#H3502608367\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3532118808\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3691309731\" class=\"local\">'Anoscopy'</a> below.)</p><p>If digital rectal exam reveals a palpable abnormality that cannot be visualized on anoscopy, the patient should be referred for transrectal ultrasound or pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (with and without contrast) to determine if the finding represents a cystic or solid lesion. The former would be suggestive of a perianal abscess, while the latter would raise concern for anal cancer.</p><p>Tests for gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, and syphilis, as well as an anal Pap test, should be obtained in all patients who have not had them performed within the past 12 months. We check these studies, even if the clinical presentation is not suggestive of proctitis or human papillomavirus (HPV)-related disease, given the high risk of these pathogens in MSM. (See <a href=\"#H1123651676\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory studies'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2597588972\" class=\"local\">'Anal Pap test'</a> below.)</p><p>If the patient has unexplained hematochezia following the initial evaluation, sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy is recommended; this is especially important in patients &ge;50 years old, in whom the risk of premalignant polyps and colon cancer is greater. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-minimal-bright-red-blood-per-rectum-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to minimal bright red blood per rectum in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3502608367\"><span class=\"h3\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>History should include a description of current symptoms, prior anorectal issues, and predisposing behaviors or medical conditions.</p><p>Rectal pain and bleeding are common symptoms with various anorectal conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F114654\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114654 \">table 1</a>). Other historical features might help to narrow the potential causes. Purulent discharge with a history of receptive anal intercourse or prior sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is suggestive of proctitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-anorectal-symptoms-in-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. Purulent discharge can also be a manifestation of a draining perianal abscess, which may be associated with fever or chills, or an anal fistula. Rectal bleeding and pain that occur with defecation are characteristic of anal fissure or hemorrhoids. Patients with anal fissure may have a history of receptive anal intercourse, chronic constipation, or prior anal fissures. The presence of weight loss may indicate anal cancer, particularly if there is a prior history of anal warts or dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-anorectal-symptoms-in-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Perianal itchiness is suggestive of pruritus ani. There may be similar prior episodes reported.</p><p>If the patient has diarrhea as a prominent symptom, proctocolitis or enteritis should be considered as possible etiologies. (See <a href=\"#H2076928624\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations and diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3532118808\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical examination should include careful inspection of the skin and mucous membranes, as well as palpation of the inguinal lymph nodes for enlargement or tenderness. Visual inspection of the anus should precede digital exam. The external rectal exam may be normal in patients with proctitis, perianal <span class=\"nowrap\">abscess/anal</span> fistula, anal cancer, and anal fissure, but drainage may be visible in some patients with proctitis or perianal <span class=\"nowrap\">abscess/anal</span> fistula (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F114654\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114654 \">table 1</a>). Skin-colored papular lesions may be seen externally in patients with anal warts, and dilated veins may be identified in patients with hemorrhoids. Inflamed skin is present in patients with pruritus ani.</p><p>Digital rectal exam should be performed using 5% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> ointment if pain is the presenting symptom. The lubricated pad of the examiner digit should be slowly introduced through the anus, and the finger should be inserted fully into the rectum with circumferential palpation for any abnormalities. Digital rectal exam will generally be normal in patients with anal <span class=\"nowrap\">warts/dysplasia</span> and pruritus ani. It often shows tenderness in patients with proctitis, perianal <span class=\"nowrap\">abscess/anal</span> fistula, anal fissure, and hemorrhoids. As noted above, severe pain on examination suggests ulceration in the anal canal. Submucosal fullness is present in patients with perianal <span class=\"nowrap\">abscess/anal</span> fistula and rectal cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1123651676\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because MSM are at increased risk for infectious proctitis and anogenital STIs, we advise STI testing in all such patients with anorectal symptoms. STI tests should include anal swabs for gonorrhea (nucleic acid amplification test [NAAT] or culture), chlamydia (NAAT), HSV (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] testing or culture), peripheral blood for syphilis serology (rapid plasma reagin [RPR]), and an anal Pap test if these have not been performed within the past 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-anorectal-symptoms-in-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

It is fixed in the same manner and interpreted using identical criteria as a cervical Pap smear (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASCUS], low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [SIL], high-grade SIL).</p><p>Standardized approaches for the management of anal dysplasia have been developed. If abnormal anal cytology is present, high-resolution anoscopy is recommended. It is performed in a similar manner to colposcopy, utilizing a microscope to better visualize the anal canal, in order to identify abnormal areas and obtain biopsy samples. The tissue is evaluated with both acetic acid (abnormal tissue appears white) and Lugol&rsquo;s iodine (abnormal tissue does not stain). Histopathology of these biopsy sites allows for grading to determine the severity of disease and further management. Although abnormal anal cytology is highly predictive of anal dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-anorectal-symptoms-in-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], there are no outcome studies documenting a reduction in mortality.

It is performed using a small, rigid, tubular instrument called an&nbsp;anoscope. Lubricant is applied, and the instrument is inserted into the anus, after which the obturator (central conical structure) is removed. Each quadrant of the anal canal is examined with the aid of a bright light as the instrument is slowly removed.

MSM have increased rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) compared with matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-anorectal-symptoms-in-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These STIs include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, syphilis, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Anogenital HPV infection is associated with a range of clinical manifestations, including anal warts, dysplasia, and cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-anorectal-symptoms-in-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p>Anorectal conditions have characteristic clinical features, and many can be diagnosed on physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F114654\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114654 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-anorectal-symptoms-in-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

In MSM, it is most often reported in persons who practice receptive anal intercourse. Infectious causes include gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, HSV infection, and syphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-anorectal-symptoms-in-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Gonorrheal rectal infection frequently results in proctitis, whereas chlamydial infection is sometimes asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-anorectal-symptoms-in-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, outbreaks of proctitis related to lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), which is caused by <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> serovars L1, L2, and L3, have been reported in MSM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-anorectal-symptoms-in-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

External rectal exam is usually normal but may show discharge, and digital rectal exam is noteworthy for diffuse tenderness.</p><p>The diagnosis of acute proctitis is suspected from history and physical examination, and the etiology is usually established with STI testing.</p><p>Proctitis should be distinguished from <strong>proctocolitis</strong>, which presents with symptoms of proctitis in association with abdominal cramping and diarrhea, and <strong>enteritis</strong>, which presents with abdominal cramping and diarrhea. Enteric pathogens causing proctocolitis, such as <em>Campylobacter</em>, <em>Shigella</em>, <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Giardia</em>, and <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em>, are not generally considered to be STIs, but sexual transmission is well described among MSM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-anorectal-symptoms-in-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

For proctitis associated with gonorrhea or chlamydial infection, testing for reinfection with the respective pathogen should be performed three months after treatment.
