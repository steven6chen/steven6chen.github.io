Circulating lipid is carried in lipoproteins that transport the lipid to various tissues for energy utilization, lipid deposition, steroid hormone production, and bile acid formation. The lipoprotein consists of esterified and unesterified cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, and protein. Based on the physicochemical characteristics of lipoproteins, these particles have been classified by their lipoprotein subclass size and concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The classification of lipoproteins, the function of the different apolipoproteins that they contain, the pathways of lipid metabolism, and how lipoprotein disorders can promote the development of atherosclerosis will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4183909306\"><span class=\"h1\">DYSLIPIDEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One definition of dyslipidemia is total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride, or lipoprotein(a) levels above the 90th percentile or high density lipoprotein cholesterol or apo A-1 levels below the 10th percentile for the general population (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71803\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71803 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>The prevalence of dyslipidemia varies with the population being studied. The prevalence is highest in patients with premature coronary heart disease (CHD), which can be defined as occurring before 55 to 60 years of age in men and before 65 years in women. In this setting, the prevalence of dyslipidemia is as high as 75 to 85 percent compared to approximately 40 to 48 percent in age-matched controls without CHD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59944\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59944 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The disturbance in lipoprotein metabolism is often familial. In one study, for example, 54 percent of all patients with premature CHD (and 70 percent of those with a lipid abnormality) had a familial disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the great majority of patients, inheritance is polygenic and the expression of dyslipidemia is strongly influenced by factors such as obesity (particularly central obesity) and the saturated fat and cholesterol content of the diet. In nations with low rates of obesity and where saturated fat intake is low, both the incidence of CHD and the prevalence of dyslipidemia are low compared to North America and Europe. This polygenic type of dyslipidemia is the major source of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. </p><p>There is a less common, but important, group of familial disorders that are monogenic. These require few or no non-genetic factors for their expression and carry a high risk of CHD at a young age, which militates for their identification as early as possible. The clinical syndrome of familial hypercholesterolemia is the leading clinical phenotype resulting from monogenic, usually dominantly inherited defects in LDL catabolism. These disorders are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The five major lipoproteins are presented below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Chylomicrons</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chylomicrons are very large particles that carry dietary lipid. They are associated with a variety of apolipoproteins, including A-I, A-II, A-IV, B-48, C-I, C-II, C-III, and E.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Very low density lipoprotein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles carry endogenous triglycerides and to a lesser degree cholesterol. The major apolipoproteins associated with VLDL are B-100, C-I, C-II, C-III, and E.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Intermediate density lipoprotein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) particles carry cholesterol esters and triglycerides. It is associated with apolipoproteins B-100, C-III, and E.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Low density lipoprotein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles carry cholesterol esters and are associated with apolipoproteins B-100 and C-III.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">High density lipoprotein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High density lipoprotein (HDL) particles carry cholesterol esters. These particles are associated with apolipoproteins (apo) A-I, A-II, C-I, C-II, C-III, D, and E.</p><p>HDL particles can be subcategorized into subclasses based on physicochemical properties (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F107711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107711 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>]. The HDL2 density range is predominantly comprised of apo A-I HDL particles (HDL-VL, HDL-L, HDL-M) and the HDL3 density range is predominantly comprised of particles containing apo A-I and A-II (HDL-S, HDL-VS). Another method used to quantify HDL particle size is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. With this technique, 47 HDL subclasses have been characterized. For simplicity, large HDL particles are those between 8.8 nm and 13 nm and small HDL particles are 7.3 nm to 8.2 nm. Large HDL particles correspond to the gradient gel electrophoresis (GGE) HDL subclass designation HDL2b (HDL-M) and 2a (HDL-VL, HDL-L), and small HDL particles correspond to the GGE designation HDL 3b (HDL-S) and 3c (HDL-VS), respectively. The NMR approach also provides a measure of total HDL particle concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], which has been shown to be more strongly associated with carotid intima media thickness, a surrogate measure of atherosclerosis, and ischemic cardiovascular events than HDL cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Ion mobility is a newer method that quantifies HDL particle concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A further modification of the ion mobility method that minimizes HDL aggregates provides more accurate separation of HDL particle concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Apolipoproteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Understanding the major functions of the different apolipoproteins is important clinically, because defects in apolipoprotein metabolism lead to abnormalities in lipid handling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The exogenous pathway starts with the intestinal absorption of dietary cholesterol and fatty acids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67905\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67905 \">figure 2</a>). The mechanisms regulating the amount of dietary cholesterol that is absorbed are unknown. Sitosterolemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder associated with hyperabsorption of cholesterol and plant sterols from the intestine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These genes involved are expressed primarily in the liver and intestine and are upregulated by cholesterol feeding; they may normally cooperate to limit intestinal sterol absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Within the intestinal cell, free fatty acids combine with glycerol to form triglycerides, and cholesterol is esterified by acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) to form cholesterol esters. The important role of ACAT was established in an animal model of ACAT deficiency, which found complete resistance to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia due to lack of cholesterol ester synthesis and reduced capacity to absorb cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Despite this, clinical trials have found that ACAT inhibitors may worsen atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Triglycerides and cholesterol are assembled intracellularly as chylomicrons. The main apolipoprotein is B-48, but C-II and E are acquired as the chylomicrons enter the circulation. Apo B-48 permits lipid binding to the chylomicron but does not bind to the low density lipoprotein receptor, thereby preventing premature clearance of chylomicrons from the circulation before they are acted upon by lipoprotein lipase (LPL).</p><p>Apo C-II is a cofactor for LPL that makes the chylomicrons progressively smaller, primarily by hydrolyzing the core triglycerides and releasing free fatty acids. The free fatty acids are then used as an energy source, converted to triglyceride, or stored in adipose tissue. The end-products of chylomicron metabolism are chylomicron remnants that are cleared from the circulation by hepatic chylomicron remnant receptors for which apo E is a high-affinity ligand. The chylomicron remnants contain a smaller core of lipids that is enveloped by excess surface components. These surface constituents are transferred from the chylomicron remnant for the formation of high density lipoprotein.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOGENOUS PATHWAY OF LIPID METABOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The endogenous pathway of lipid metabolism begins with the synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) by the liver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51771\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51771 \">figure 3</a>). VLDL particles contain a core of triglycerides (60 percent by mass) and cholesterol esters (20 percent by mass). Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is an intracellular lipid-transfer protein found in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is essential for the transfer of the lipid molecules (principally triglycerides) onto apolipoprotein (apo) B 100 in the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. The surface apolipoproteins for VLDL are noted above. They include apo C-II, which acts as a cofactor for lipoprotein lipase; apo C-III, which inhibits this enzyme; and apo B-100 and E, which serve as ligands for the apolipoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">B/E</span> (low density lipoprotein [LDL]) receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In the absence of functional MTP, VLDL is not secreted into the circulation. Abetalipoproteinemia is a rare genetic disorder in which MTP is absent. </p><p>The triglyceride core of nascent VLDL particles is hydrolyzed by lipoprotein lipase. During lipolysis, the core of the VLDL particle is reduced, generating VLDL remnant particles (also called intermediate density lipoprotein [IDL]) that are depleted of triglycerides via a process similar to the generation of chylomicron remnants. Some of the excess surface components in the remnant particle, including phospholipid, unesterified cholesterol, and apolipoproteins A, C and E, are transferred to high density lipoprotein (HDL).</p><p>Lipoprotein lipase requires the binding of a protein that is expressed on capillary endothelial cells, called GPIHBP1 (glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein binding protein 1), for full activity in the capillary lumen. Its mode of action is to shuttle lipoprotein lipase (LPL) from the interstitial side of endothelial cells to the capillary side. In the capillary lumen, LPL hydrolyzes triglycerides contained in the core of chylomicrons and VLDL; it also facilitates cholesterol transfer from these lipoproteins to HDL (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51771\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51771 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F51253\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51253 \">figure 4B</a>). The hydrolysis of triglycerides releases free fatty acids that are then used as an energy source, converted to triglyceride, or stored in adipose tissue. The metabolic regulation of fasting and postprandial triglyceride and HDL concentrations is modulated by lipoprotein ligands and the combined actions of LPL, hepatic lipase, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51771\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51771 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F51253\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51253 \">figure 4B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. Both inherited and acquired disorders of triglyceride metabolism have been identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75442\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75442 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Patients with a deficiency GPIHBP1 have low levels of active LPL, impaired intravascular hydrolysis of triglycerides, and severe hypertriglyceridemia (with chylomicronemia). Missense mutations of GPIHBP1 have been identified as have monoclonal auto-antibodies to GPIHBP1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>VLDL remnants can either be cleared from the circulation by the apo <span class=\"nowrap\">B/E</span> (LDL) or the remnant receptors, or remodeled by hepatic lipase to form LDL particles. There are four common sequence polymorphisms in the hepatic lipase gene promoter; the most frequent is a C to T substitution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The presence of a C allele is associated with higher hepatic lipase activity; smaller, denser, and more atherogenic LDL particles; and inversely with lower levels of HDL cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Low density lipoprotein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LDL particles contain a core of cholesterol esters, lesser amounts of triglyceride, and are enriched in apolipoprotein B-100, which is the ligand for binding to the apo <span class=\"nowrap\">B/E</span> (LDL) receptor. LDL can be internalized by hepatic and nonhepatic tissues. Hepatic LDL cholesterol can be converted to bile acids and secreted into the intestinal lumen. LDL cholesterol internalized by nonhepatic tissues can be used for hormone production, cell membrane synthesis, or stored in the esterified form.</p><p>The internalization of LDL is regulated by cellular cholesterol requirements via negative feedback control of apo <span class=\"nowrap\">B/E</span> (LDL) receptor expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Cells in positive cholesterol balance, for example, suppress apo <span class=\"nowrap\">B/E</span> (LDL) receptor expression. On the other hand, decreased activity of HMG CoA reductase, the enzyme that controls the rate of de novo cholesterol synthesis by the cell, leads sequentially to a fall in cell cholesterol, increased expression of apo <span class=\"nowrap\">B/E</span> (LDL) receptors, enhanced uptake of cholesterol from the circulation, and a reduction in the plasma cholesterol concentration.</p><p>Chemically-modified LDL, such as oxidized LDL, can also enter macrophages and some other tissues through the unregulated scavenger receptor. This pathway can result in excess accumulation of intracellular cholesterol and the formation of foam cells, which contribute to the formation of atheromatous plaques. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Lipoproteins and atherosclerosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The importance of the LDL receptor in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism has been demonstrated in both experimental animals and humans.

Apo(a) links to apolipoprotein B-100 on the surface of LDL by disulfide bridges. The formation of apo(a):apo B complexes requires an LDL particle of a certain morphology and composition.

Thus, there is a direct relationship between apolipoprotein B-100 and LDL particle number. </p><p>Elevated plasma concentrations of apo B-100-containing lipoproteins can induce the development of atherosclerosis even in the absence of other risk factors. It has been proposed that the initiating event in atherogenesis is the subendothelial retention of apo B-100-containing lipoproteins via a charge-mediated interaction with proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that mice expressing LDL with defective proteoglycan binding develop significantly less atherosclerosis than mice expressing wild-type LDL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Small LDL particles penetrate the endothelial barrier 1.7-fold more than large LDL particles; these electronegative small LDL particles interact with positively charged intimal proteoglycans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. The increased retention of small LDL particles in the vessel wall allows a longer time for reactive oxygen species modification of surface phospholipids and unesterified cholesterol. In addition, the small LDL phenotype is associated with a clustering of other risk factors, including elevated levels of triglycerides, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), and intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), reduced concentrations of HDL and HDL2, and insulin resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

Due to delayed clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins on VLDL particles that carry apo C-III or reduced lipoprotein lipase activity, which is common in insulin resistance, the VLDL remnants may enter the vessel wall or be converted to small LDL particles. Small LDL particles have conformational changes in apoB that impair the efficiency of LDL receptor-mediated clearance, thereby allowing these particles to circulate for a longer duration where they become susceptible to oxidation, glycation, and glyco-oxidation. High concentrations of chylomicron remnants or VLDL particles result in lower levels of HDL cholesterol, a process that results from cholesteryl ester transfer protein-mediated lipid exchange between triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and the cholesterol cargo of HDL particles. Triglyceride-enriched HDL particles have reduced macrophage cholesterol efflux capacity. Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins increase endothelial activation, facilitate monocyte infiltration into the arterial wall, and increase activation of pro-inflammatory genes via AP-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/116,117\" class=\"abstract_t\">116,117</a>]. </p><p>Triglyceride-rich remnant lipoproteins are able to penetrate the arterial wall and may be retained preferentially, thus causing atherosclerosis due to their cholesterol component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/118,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">118,119</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1823949\"><span class=\"h3\">Apolipoprotein C-III</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevated levels of apo C-III are associated with increased triglyceride levels and an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; lower levels of apo C-III are associated with lower triglyceride levels and reduced risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>].

Circulating lipid is carried in lipoproteins that transport the lipid to various tissues for energy utilization, lipid deposition, steroid hormone production, and bile acid formation. The lipoprotein consists of esterified and unesterified cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, and protein. The protein components of the lipoprotein are known as apolipoproteins (apo) or apoproteins. The different apolipoproteins serve as cofactors for enzymes and ligands for receptors.
