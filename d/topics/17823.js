Decreased iron stores or decreased availability of iron are the most common reasons for resistance to the effect of these agents.</p><p>This topic reviews screening for iron deficiency, the indications for iron therapy, and options for treatment of iron deficiency among dialysis patients.

However, bone marrow biopsies to assess iron stores are rarely done among hemodialysis patients. Instead, iron stores are estimated among such patients. Estimation methods include measurement of the serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and ferritin and calculation of the percent transferrin saturation (TSAT); determination of the percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (RBCs); and determination of the reticulocyte hemoglobin (Hb) content. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of iron deficiency in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We use the serum iron, TIBC, and ferritin and calculation of the percent TSAT to estimate iron stores. Other methods may be more extensively used in Europe but are not widely available in the United States. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-in-chronic-kidney-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of iron deficiency in chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Percent hypochromic HRCs and reticulocyte hemoglobin content'</a>.)</p><p>The laboratory criteria that are used to define iron deficiency and provide indication for treatment are markedly different among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients compared with patients with relatively normal renal function. Laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of absolute and functional iron deficiency in dialysis and nondialysis CKD patients are discussed elsewhere.

Both are common among hemodialysis patients. Screening tests for iron deficiency include the percent transferrin saturation (TSAT), which is the plasma iron divided by total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) x 100, and the serum ferritin concentration.

In one randomized trial of non-iron-deficient, ESA-treated dialysis and nondialysis CKD patients, compared with patients who did not receive iron, the administration of IV iron increased the Hb independent of the ESA dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1724714354\"><span class=\"h3\">ESA-treated patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For all hemodialysis patients who are being treated with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), we suggest maintenance or low-dose iron irrespective of the TSAT, providing the ferritin is &le;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>.

Approximately 1000 mg is required among hemodialysis patients to raise Hb levels from approximately 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> to 11 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> with the initiation of ESA therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

If the increased ESA dose does not raise the Hb level sufficiently, we occasionally try supplemental iron with or without a further increase in erythropoietin dose. There is some evidence that IV iron, in association with an increase in ESA dose, can increase Hb levels at least over the short term among patients with high ferritin values. In the Dialysis Patients' Response to IV Iron with Elevated Ferritin (DRIVE) study, among 134 patients with Hb levels &lt;11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> ferritin levels &ge;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> and TSAT levels &le;25 percent, those assigned to IV iron had a larger increase in Hb in response to ESA at six weeks of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, the difference in Hb response at six weeks is of unclear clinical significance, and long-term, meaningful clinical outcomes were not assessed.

Decreased iron stores or decreased availability of iron are the most common reasons for resistance to the effect of these agents. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use the serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and ferritin and calculation of the percent transferrin saturation (TSAT) to identify iron deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H2935613859\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of iron deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The indications for iron treatment and the dose of iron (ie, loading versus a lower maintenance dose) vary depending on the hemoglobin (Hb) and on whether patients are also on ESAs to maintain the target Hb. Iron should not be given in the setting of active infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among all hemodialysis patients with TSAT &le;20 percent and ferritin &le;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> we recommend administering a loading dose of iron (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Most patients will have an Hb &lt;10, and, among such individuals, repletion of iron stores increases the Hb and increases sensitivity to ESAs. Iron should be given prior to the administration of treatment with an ESA. (See <a href=\"#H601225303\" class=\"local\">'TSAT less than or equal to 20 percent and ferritin less than or equal to 200 ng/mL'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among all hemodialysis patients who have Hb &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> or are being treated with an ESA to maintain Hb at target and a TSAT &le;30 percent and ferritin &le;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> we suggest administering a loading dose of iron (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Among some patients with these indices, administration of iron may increase Hb and ESA sensitivity. Iron should be given prior to ESA treatment. (See <a href=\"#H3341642576\" class=\"local\">'TSAT less than or equal to 30 percent and ferritin less than or equal to 500 ng/mL'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest the administration of maintenance iron to all hemodialysis patients who have a ferritin &le;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> and are being treated with an ESA, irrespective of the TSAT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Maintenance iron may prevent the development of iron deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1724714354\" class=\"local\">'ESA-treated patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We do not routinely administer intravenous (IV) iron to patients with ferritin levels above 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> and to other subgroups of patients with abnormal indices who do not meet the above criteria. However, each patient should be individually assessed and monitored. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1827857268\" class=\"local\">'Ferritin greater than 500 ng/mL'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To all hemodialysis patients selected for iron therapy, we recommend parenteral rather than oral iron therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Among maintenance hemodialysis patients, IV iron is more effective than oral iron in increasing Hb concentrations and iron stores.
