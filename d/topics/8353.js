HPV infection has been etiologically linked with condyloma acuminatum, squamous intraepithelial lesions, and anogenital malignancy, including cervical, vaginal, vulval, penile, and anal carcinoma. </p><p>Many patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, particularly those arising in the base of the tongue and in the tonsillar region, do not have the traditional risk factors associated with head and neck cancers (eg, smoking, smokeless tobacco, alcohol consumption). Epidemiologic and molecular studies have identified the HPV-16 genotype of HPV as a causative agent in many of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other high-risk HPV genotypes, such as HPV-18, 31, or 33, are also causative but are less common. These high-risk HPV infections may also rarely cause cancers at other head and neck sites. </p><p>The role of HPV infection in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is presented here. Other risk factors for head and neck cancer are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors for head and neck cancer&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2128117224\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOLOGY OF HPV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HPV are small deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses that are widely distributed in vertebrates. These viruses contain an 8 kilobase long, double-stranded, circular DNA genome. The papillomavirus genome comprises early and late genes that encode early proteins E1-E7 and late proteins L1-L2. The early proteins are nonstructural proteins involved in replication and transcription of the genome (E1-E5) or in host cell tumoral transformation (E6 and E7), whereas L1 and L2 are the structural capsid proteins of the virion.</p><p>The HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes encode proteins consisting of approximately 151 and 98 amino acids, respectively. These genes are largely responsible for the onset and persistence of the malignant process in both head and neck and anogenital cancers. </p><p>The molecular profiles of HPV positive tumors are distinct from those of HPV negative cancers. The absence of genetic or epigenetic alterations in the p53 and pRb pathways in HPV positive head and neck cancers is in sharp contrast to what is observed in HPV negative head and neck cancer. In the typical HPV negative squamous cell carcinomas, p53 mutations are very frequent, along with decreased levels of p16 and increased levels of pRb. By contrast, HPV positive carcinomas are associated with wild-type p53, down regulation of pRb, and upregulation of p16. These differences in gene expression suggest that HPV positive and HPV negative head and neck cancers represent distinct entities.</p><p>The virology of HPV and its role in the molecular pathogenesis of malignancy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virology of human papillomavirus infections and the link to cancer&quot;, section on 'Molecular pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13763970\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22893603\"><span class=\"h2\">HPV associated cancers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that there has been a decrease in the incidence of laryngeal, hypopharyngeal, and oral cavity cancers beginning in the late 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This decline has been associated with the current decrease in smoking, which is the primary risk factor for these cancers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3839246369\"><span class=\"h3\">Oropharyngeal carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the decrease in tobacco use, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer initially remained constant and then began to rise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Multiple lines of evidence linked the increase in oropharyngeal cancer to HPV related cancers arising in the base of the tongue and the tonsillar region. </p><p>This association is primarily with HPV-16, which is known to be carcinogenic at other sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Cohort studies from the 1990s suggested that approximately 50 percent of oropharyngeal cancers were attributable to HPV, while more recent studies suggest that HPV accounts for 70 to 80 percent of cases in North America and Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Analyses of worldwide cancer statistics from 1983 to 2002 have found a significant increase in the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer in men in developed countries, with disease occurring at younger ages, consistent with a role for HPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>The timing between exposure to HPV and the development of oropharyngeal cancer probably exceeds 10 years. The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort (EPIC) identified 638 individuals with head and neck cancer, for whom plasma samples had been obtained an average of six years prior to diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among the 135 patients with oropharyngeal cancer, antibodies against the E6 antigen were present in 35 percent, in contrast to 0.6 percent of controls. The prevalence of antibodies against E6 was not elevated in patients with other cancers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3735797819\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-oropharyngeal carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of HPV infection in other head and neck cancers is less well defined. The variability in results is illustrated by two large contemporary studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review and meta-analysis identified 148 studies, including 12,163 cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The HPV prevalence rates in oropharyngeal, oral cavity, and laryngeal cancers were 45.8, 24.2, and 22.1 percent, respectively, and the prevalence rates of HPV-16 positivity were 40.6, 14.9, and 13.4 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An international study centrally analyzed samples from 3680 cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The prevalence of HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for oropharyngeal, oral cavity, and laryngeal cancers was 24.9, 7.4, and 5.7 percent, respectively. Samples were also analyzed for HPV E6 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and p16 positivity by immunohistochemistry. The presence of HPV DNA and either HPV E6 mRNA or p16 positivity was considered indicative of an etiologic role for HPV; this was observed in 22.4, 4.4, and 3.5 percent of oropharyngeal, oral cavity, and laryngeal cancers, respectively. There was a high degree of heterogeneity within this study, based upon the geographic sites from which samples were derived, as well as within anatomic subsites.</p><p/><p>An analysis of 520 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas based upon gene expression profiling found that HPV driven tumors accounted for 4.1 percent of non-oropharyngeal cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These HPV driven tumors had similar gene expression, DNA methylation, and histopathology when compared with HPV associated oropharyngeal carcinomas. Although the sample size was limited, HPV associated non-oropharyngeal carcinomas did not appear to have improved overall survival compared with non-oropharyngeal carcinomas not associated with HPV. In patients with HPV associated tumors, non-oropharyngeal tumors had fewer tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) compared with those arising in the oropharynx, suggesting that this difference in prognosis was due to differences in the immune response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1587553047\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence of oral HPV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oncogenic oral HPV infection is detectable in the majority of patients with HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer, but the incidence of such HPV infection in long-term sexual partners is not increased beyond that seen in the general population.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the general population, a cross-sectional study of men and women aged 14 to 69 years found that the overall prevalence of HPV DNA in oral exfoliated cells was 6.9 percent, and the prevalence of HPV-16 was 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. HPV prevalence was approximately three-fold more common in men compared with women (10.1 versus 3.6 percent), consistent with the observed sex distribution for HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study analyzed oral rinse samples for the presence of HPV in patients with HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer and their long-term sexual partners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In the 164 patients with oropharyngeal cancer, oral HPV was detected in 65 percent of cases, and an oncogenic HPV strain was identified in 61 percent; 88 of 100 positive for oncogenic HPV had HPV-16. Among the 93 partners available for testing, the overall incidence of HPV infection was 4 percent, and only one had the oncogenic HPV-16. These findings suggest that most partners effectively clear any active infection to which they are exposed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of HPV-16 in the oral cavity has been associated with the subsequent development of oropharyngeal carcinoma. In a case control study of 132 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, mouthwash samples were available from prior prospective collection, obtained a median of 3.9 years prior to the diagnosis of cancer and analyzed for HPV. HPV was identified in 5 of 25 patients (20 percent) who subsequently developed oropharyngeal carcinoma versus 1 of 75 matched controls without cancer (OR 22.4, 95% CI 1.8-276.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H769820056\"><span class=\"h2\">HPV vaccination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HPV vaccination has been associated with a decrease in the subsequent prevalence of oral HPV infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a preliminary report of a population-based study from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2627 men and women aged 18 to 33 years were analyzed for the presence or absence of HPV in oral washes a mean of four years after vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Based upon self-report, 18.3 percent of the study population had received one or more doses of vaccine. The prevalence of oral infection with HPV types 16, 18, 6, or 11 was 0.11 percent in those who had received vaccine versus 1.61 percent in those who had not been vaccinated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H418308675\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND BIOMARKER ANALYSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H418308681\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gold standard for assessing HPV infection is in situ hybridization or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Several biomarkers may serve as surrogates for HPV status or be useful in further refining the risk associated with HPV infection. Real-time PCR to measure HPV-16 viral load <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunohistochemistry to detect p16 expression are commonly used in the clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/1,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15</a>].</p><p>The p16 protein functions as a tumor suppressor by binding to the cyclin D1 <span class=\"nowrap\">CDK4/CDK6</span> complex, preventing phosphorylation of the Rb protein. The p16 protein is overexpressed in HPV associated cancers.</p><p>Either HPV status or p16 status can be used as a marker of HPV infection, depending upon availability in the treating institution. In one multi-institutional trial that included 433 oropharyngeal patients, samples of 316 patients were assessed for both p16 (strong and diffuse, nuclear and cytoplasmic staining in at least 70 percent of tumor cells) and HPV (by in situ hybridization). Ten percent of those positive by p16 were negative for HPV, and 7 percent of those negative for p16 were positive for HPV. </p><p>However, studies using p16 as a surrogate marker for HPV positivity appear to have demonstrated a similar impact on survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The p16 status, as assessed by immunohistochemistry, may provide additional information beyond HPV positivity. In a study comparing the effect of p16 expression and HPV DNA presence, cases that were HPV positive with high p16 expression had a better prognosis than those that were HPV positive but with low expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H418308789\"><span class=\"h1\">OROPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oropharyngeal cancer associated with HPV has important differences in its clinicopathologic features compared with oropharyngeal cancer not associated with HPV.

The most extensive data come from an analysis by the International Collaboration on Oropharyngeal Cancer Network for Staging (ICON-S), which included data from 1907 patients with HPV positive oropharyngeal cancer and 696 with HPV negative oropharyngeal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathology &ndash; Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for p16 is highly sensitive for HPV associated tumors, and we recommend its routine use as a surrogate for HPV status. If decision making hinges on HPV status, this diagnosis can be confirmed with either polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HPV or by in situ hybridization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Rare cases of HPV associated lesions arising in the head and neck that are high-grade neuroendocrine tumors (small cell carcinomas) have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

In the ICON-S database, the median age for those with HPV positive disease was 57 years versus 61 years in those with HPV negative disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This difference in patient age, along with differences in comorbidity due to the decreased incidence of tobacco and alcohol excess, has major implications for the ability to tolerate treatment, which can in turn affect the prognosis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gender &ndash; there is a heavy preponderance of male gender in patients with HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer. In the ICON-S database, 84 percent of patients were male; among those with HPV negative oropharyngeal cancer, 76 percent were male [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Why the oropharynx is more susceptible than other head and neck sites to HPV transformation is unclear. Like uterine cervix, the oropharynx offers easy access for infection. The tonsils contain deep invaginations of the mucosal surface believed to favor the capture and processing of antigens, which may facilitate viral access to basal cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical stage and prognosis &ndash; HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer is more likely to present with an early-stage <span class=\"nowrap\">(T1/T2)</span> primary tumor, even though there is an increased risk of more advanced disease in the neck <span class=\"nowrap\">(N2/N3)</span>. In the ICON-S study, the frequency of an early-stage (T1 or T2) primary tumor was significantly higher in those with HPV positive disease (64 versus 44 percent), while the incidence of more advanced nodal involvement (N2 or N3) was significantly higher (69 versus 51 percent) compared with those with HPV negative tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Despite this biologic aggressiveness of HPV positive cancer manifested by earlier and more extensive lymph node involvement, these tumors have a better prognosis than head and neck cancers not associated with HPV.
