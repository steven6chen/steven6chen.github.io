This electrical signal follows a path to spread across the heart. As it spreads, the signal causes the heart muscle to squeeze. Each time the heart squeezes (&quot;beats&quot;), it pumps blood all over the body. Normally, the heart beats in a regular way 60 to 100 times a minute.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10116213\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes the heart to beat too slowly?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The heart can beat too slowly if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrical signals don't start often enough.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The electrical signal gets slowed down or blocked as it spreads across the heart.</p><p/><p>Having a slow heartbeat doesn't always cause problems. Both children and adults can have bradycardia and still be healthy. For example, it is common for athletes to have a slow heartbeat. It is also common for people to have a slower heartbeat when they are sleeping.</p><p>Certain medicines, especially medicines used to treat heart problems or high blood pressure, can also cause bradycardia.</p><p>Other times, bradycardia is caused by a problem or condition, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A problem with the heart's electrical system.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other heart problems, including recent heart surgery or a heart attack.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain infections.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep apnea &ndash; This is when people stop breathing for short amounts of time when they are asleep.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anorexia &ndash; This is an eating disorder that makes people lose more weight than is healthy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10116228\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of bradycardia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people have no symptoms.</p><p>Other people have symptoms with their bradycardia. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling light-headed or dizzy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fainting or feeling like you are going to faint</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired, either all the time or only when you exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eating less than usual or acting tired (in babies)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10116243\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you or your child has symptoms of bradycardia, call your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10116258\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for bradycardia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. During the exam, he or she will check your pulse and listen to your heart.</p><p>To see if your heartbeat is slower than normal, he or she will do an ECG (also called an &quot;electrocardiogram&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;). An ECG is a test that measures the electrical activity in the heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Your doctor might want to record your heartbeat over the course of hours or days. If so, he or she will have you wear or carry a heart monitor device around at home (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76605\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76605 \">figure 2</a>). This device will measure and record your heart's electrical activity. You should keep doing your normal activities while you wear or carry the monitor. While you wear the monitor, you should also write down any symptoms you have. That way, your doctor can see if bradycardia is causing your symptoms.</p><p>After your doctor knows for sure that you have bradycardia, he or she might do tests to look for the cause. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests to see how your heartbeat changes when you get certain medicines</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10116273\"><span class=\"h1\">How is bradycardia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on your symptoms and what's causing your bradycardia.</p><p>People who have no symptoms usually do not need treatment.</p><p>People who have symptoms will likely need treatment. Your doctor might change or stop any medicines that could be slowing your heartbeat.</p><p>Some people with bradycardia are treated with a device called a &quot;pacemaker.&quot; A pacemaker sits under the skin near a person's heart and sends electrical signals to the heart. These signals help the heart beat at a normal rate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10116288\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacemakers-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pacemakers (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-fainting-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Syncope (fainting) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sick-sinus-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sick sinus syndrome (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-fainting-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Syncope (fainting) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacemakers-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pacemakers (Beyond the Basics)</a> </p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
