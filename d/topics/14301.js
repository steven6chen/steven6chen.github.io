The liver is a big organ in the upper right side of the belly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64960 \">figure 1</a>). PBC happens when the body's infection-fighting system, called the &quot;immune system,&quot; attacks the liver. It is also called &quot;primary biliary cirrhosis.&quot;</p><p>PBC is a serious disease. It can scar the liver and make it stop working. This can cause death. Most people who get PBC are women, but men sometimes get it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14080540\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of primary biliary cholangitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people with PBC have no symptoms. When symptoms do happen, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling very tired &ndash; People who have PBC are often sleepy in the daytime, even if they slept at night.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itching &ndash; This can be worse at night, if a person wears tight or itchy clothes, or in hot weather.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin changes &ndash; These can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dry skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hives &ndash; Red, puffy areas that happen where a person scratches or rubs the skin.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dark patches on the skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Yellow color of the skin and whites of the eyes &ndash; This is called &quot;jaundice.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the joints</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry eyes and mouth</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain (on the upper right side of the belly)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing weight without trying</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Memory and thinking problems</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14080555\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for primary biliary cholangitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. Tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests &ndash; This test can show if PBC or another condition is causing the symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver biopsy &ndash; For this test, a doctor puts a needle into your liver and takes out a small sample of tissue. The sample helps doctors make sure PBC is the cause of symptoms. It also tells doctors how much damage there is.</p><p/><p>Some people have imaging tests, such as an X-ray or MRI. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14080570\"><span class=\"h1\">How is primary biliary cholangitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors treat PBC with medicines to slow down the liver damage. Other treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diet changes &ndash; For example, some people with PBC need to eat less fat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamins &ndash; Some people with PBC do not get enough of certain vitamins from food. If you are not getting enough vitamins, the doctor can tell you which vitamins to take and how much. Do <strong>not</strong> take any vitamins or medicines without talking to your doctor or nurse first.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to treat health problems caused by PBC, such as itching or anemia (having too few red blood cells)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver transplant &ndash; If your PBC is severe, or the medicines to slow down liver damage do not work, you might need a new liver. During a transplant, a doctor does surgery to replace the damaged liver with a healthy one.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ask your doctor if you might need a liver transplant for PBC. If you do, your doctor will do more tests to make sure you are healthy enough for this kind of surgery. Then your doctor will put you on a waiting list for a liver transplant. Liver transplants are given to people with the most damaged livers first. People often have to wait up to 2 years for a new liver.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14080585\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cirrhosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Liver transplant (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-biopsy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Liver biopsy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hives-urticaria-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hives (urticaria) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
