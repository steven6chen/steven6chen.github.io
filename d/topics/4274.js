The large intestine is also called the colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66110 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Doctors might do a colectomy to treat problems such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colon cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Digestive tract disorders, such as severe diverticulitis or inflammatory bowel disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blockage in the colon</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An injury to the colon</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10266597\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I prepare for a colectomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor will tell you how to prepare for your colectomy. You might need to eat certain foods and avoid other foods in the days before your surgery. Your doctor will tell how long before the surgery you should stop eating and drinking.</p><p>Your doctor will tell you if you need to change or stop any of your medicines before the surgery. He or she might also give you medicine to take beforehand. For example, you will probably get antibiotics to prevent infection, plus a medicine to empty your intestines (this is called &quot;bowel prep&quot;).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10266611\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during a colectomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before the surgery starts, you will get medicines (through a thin tube that goes into a vein, called an &quot;IV&quot;) to make you sleep. You will not be awake for the surgery.</p><p>There are 2 different ways your doctor can do a colectomy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open surgery &ndash; During open surgery, your doctor will make a cut in your belly. He or she will remove some or all of your colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58531\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58531 \">figure 2</a>). How much your doctor removes depends on the reason for your surgery and how severe your condition is.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopic surgery &ndash; During laparoscopic surgery, your doctor will make a few small cuts in your belly. Then he or she will insert long, thin tools through the cuts and into your belly. One of the tools has a camera (called a &quot;laparoscope&quot;) on the end, which sends pictures to a TV screen. Your doctor can look at the screen to know where to cut and what to remove. Then he or she uses the long tools to do the surgery through the small cuts.</p><p/><p>After your doctor removes your colon, he or she will make sure there is a way for bowel movements to exit your body. To do this, your doctor will either:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reconnect your intestine &ndash; If your doctor can reconnect your intestine, you should be able to have bowel movements normally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do a procedure called a &quot;colostomy&quot; or &quot;ileostomy&quot; &ndash; For either of these procedures, your doctor will make a small hole in your belly. Then he or she will connect your intestine to this opening. If your doctor connects your large intestine to the hole, it&rsquo;s called a &quot;colostomy.&quot; If your doctor connects your small intestine to the hole, it's called an &quot;ileostomy.&quot; Your bowel movements will come out through the hole into a bag that is attached to your skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57774\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57774 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10266626\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After surgery, most people stay in the hospital for 3 to 7 days.</p><p>Your intestines need to heal before you can eat solid foods again. Most people can drink liquids within 1 to 2 days after surgery and eat solid foods soon after that. If your intestines take longer to heal, your doctor might need to give you extra nutrition through a vein in your arm until you can eat again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10266641\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can happen after a colectomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although uncommon, there are problems that can happen after a colectomy. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding in the belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection in the belly or other parts of the body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blockage of the remaining part of the colon</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leakage at the place where the intestine is reconnected</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injury to the ureter (the tube that connects the kidney to the bladder), which is near the colon</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10266656\"><span class=\"h1\">How will I manage my colostomy or ileostomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A special nurse (called an ostomy nurse) will teach you how to manage your colostomy or ileostomy. He or she will teach you when and how to change the bag that collects your bowel movements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10266671\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I have my colostomy for the rest of my life?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people have a colostomy for a short time while their body heals after a colectomy. This is often the case if the colectomy was done for an emergency. Most people do not need to have a colostomy for the rest of their life, but some do.</p><p>If you need a colostomy for only a short time, your doctor will do another surgery later to reconnect your colon. Then you can have bowel movements normally again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10266694\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-and-rectal-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colon and rectal cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulcerative-colitis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ulcerative colitis in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=crohn-disease-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Crohn disease in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colostomy-care-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colostomy care (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ileostomy-care-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ileostomy care (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-and-rectal-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Colon and rectal cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulcerative-colitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ulcerative colitis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=crohn-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Crohn disease (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
