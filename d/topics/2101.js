Worldwide, bladder cancer accounts for approximately 540,000 new cases and 188,000 deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In developed areas of the world, such as North America and Western Europe, these bladder cancers are predominantly urothelial.</p><p>Nearly 70 percent of new bladder cancer diagnoses are early-stage (ie, Ta, Tis, and T1 disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110763\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110763 \">table 1</a>)) and have not yet invaded the muscular layer of the bladder wall. These patients are often managed with transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) with or without adjuvant intravesical therapy. The remaining 30 percent of patients have muscle-invasive bladder cancer, including cancer involving the muscularis propria (T2), perivesical tissue (T3), or adjacent pelvic <span class=\"nowrap\">organs/structures</span> (T4).</p><p>Radical cystectomy remains the cornerstone of curative treatment for muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer. Radical cystectomy involves removal of the bladder (in combination with removal of the <span class=\"nowrap\">uterus/ovaries/fallopian</span> tubes and possibly a portion of the vagina in women, and the prostate and seminal vesicles in men), pelvic lymph node dissection, and reconstruction of the urinary tract. The morbidity and long-term outcomes of cystectomy are well documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Because of the high risk of distant failure in muscle-invasive bladder cancer, systemic chemotherapy either before or after radical cystectomy is often recommended to improve outcomes. Modern series of patients managed with radical cystectomy have a five-year pelvic control rate of nearly 80 percent and five-year overall survival rates ranging from 40 to 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Modern oncologic therapies are increasingly driven towards organ preservation and maximizing functional outcomes while maintaining treatment efficacy. Combined-modality therapy (CMT) incorporating maximal TURBT followed by radiation therapy with concurrent radiosensitizing chemotherapy can be a comparably effective regimen to preserve a functioning bladder in well-selected patients who are either poor candidates for radical cystectomy or patients who are motivated to maintain their native bladder. This combined modality approach utilizing TURBT followed by radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy is often referred to as trimodality therapy (TMT).</p><p>This topic discusses CMT for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. An overview of the approach to the treatment of bladder cancer is presented separately.

Briefly, patients should undergo cystoscopy with transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) along with an examination under anesthesia to assess the local extent of disease. Imaging studies are needed to rule out disseminated disease in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Because urothelial carcinoma can be multifocal, upper tract urothelial carcinoma of the ureters or renal pelvis should be ruled out as well. The diagnosis and staging of bladder cancer is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of bladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the bladder is a promising modality to assess the local extent of disease, and has proven more useful in distinguishing non-muscle invasive from invasive disease and in assessing for perivesical disease extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]. Advanced MRI with nanoparticle lymphangiography may also prove more useful at detecting pelvic nodal metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>]. If obtained, bladder MRI should be performed before TURBT, as it may be difficult to distinguish between tumor and post-surgical change. However, MRI is getting better at differentiating between scar and tumor, and this deserves further investigation. More accurate bladder-specific imaging with MRI may also assist with radiation treatment planning in those patients who choose bladder-preserving, combined-modality therapy (CMT) to better delineate tumor boost volumes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4615478\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radical cystectomy with neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the standard approach for the treatment of muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer; for patients who are not candidates for radical cystectomy or who desire preservation of their native bladder, combined-modality therapy (CMT) incorporating maximal transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) followed by radiation therapy (RT) with concurrent chemotherapy is an appropriate alternative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This CMT is often referred to as trimodality therapy (TMT). RT may be given either as a split course or as a continuous course, with careful assessment of response, as shown in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F112081\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112081 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>The most extensive data on results of CMT are from a retrospective series of 475 patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer who were treated at a single institution between 1986 and 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In this series, all patients underwent TURBT followed by concurrent radiation and chemotherapy. Radical cystectomy was recommended for those patients who did not have a complete response and for those with recurrent muscle-invasive disease. The 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival rates were 66 and 59 percent, respectively; the risk of salvage cystectomy was 29 percent at five years. When evaluating the cohort over treatment eras, rates of complete response improved from 66 to 88 percent, and five-year disease-specific survival improved from 60 to 84 percent during the eras of 1986 to 1995 to 2005 to 2013, while the five-year risk of salvage radical cystectomy rate decreased from 42 to 16 percent.</p><p>There have been no completed definitive, randomized trials that compare bladder-preserving CMT with radical cystectomy. The Selective Bladder Preservation Against Radical Excision (SPARE) trial was a randomized phase III study (with a built-in pilot feasibility study) initiated in the United Kingdom (UK) comparing radical cystectomy versus RT (&plusmn;chemotherapy) in muscle-invasive bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, this trial was closed due to poor accrual.</p><p>A comparison of CMT with radical cystectomy based upon prospective series is extremely challenging due to differences in patient selection. Prospective studies evaluating bladder-preserving CMT necessarily analyze patients treated based upon clinical staging, whereas radical cystectomy series report pathological staging. Numerous small retrospective series attempted to compare CMT with radical cystectomy. A meta-analysis based upon data from 9000 patients in eight studies found no significant difference in overall survival, disease-specific survival, or progression-free survival at 5 or 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Other approaches that have been used to preserve a functioning bladder include TURBT alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], TURBT followed by interstitial brachytherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], partial cystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and radiation with intra-arterial chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, none of these have an established role in muscle-invasive bladder cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4615492\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bladder-preserving combined-modality therapy (CMT) is an appropriate treatment strategy for selected patients with muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer who are not surgical candidates due to medical comorbidities and for those who desire to retain their native bladder. </p><p>Even among patients with minimal medical comorbidities, radical cystectomy is associated with a treatment-related mortality risk of 1 to 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], with an increasing risk in patients with more severe comorbidities. Furthermore, urothelial carcinoma is a disease of the older population, and the median age at diagnosis is 73 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The 90-day perioperative mortality rates for patients &le;69, 70 to 79, and &ge;80 years old have been reported to be as high as 2, 5, and 9 percent, respectively, in a population-based study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Furthermore, cigarette smoking is an etiologic factor for bladder cancer, and many patients have one or more tobacco-related comorbidities that increase the risk of perioperative mortality.</p><p>Although there are no absolute criteria for identifying candidates for bladder-preserving CMT, important factors include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urothelial histology &ndash; Prospective studies evaluating the use of CMT have been performed exclusively in patients with urothelial histology, and thus cannot be generalized to patients with less common histologies (squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, micropapillary). In addition, non-urothelial carcinoma histologies may respond less favorably to chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although CMT has been used primarily for patients with pure urothelial bladder cancer, this approach appears to have a similar level of activity for those with variant urothelial pathology (eg, elements of squamous or glandular differentiation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, because of the limited number of patients in some of the histologic variants, definitive equivalence cannot be established.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maximal TURBT &ndash; A visibly complete transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) is associated with a higher complete response rate after chemoradiation, decreased rates of salvage cystectomy, and improved overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>]. Although complete resection is optimal, a complete response was achieved in 57 percent of patients with a visibly incomplete TURBT in a single-institution series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Similarly, over one-third of patients in the randomized Bladder Cancer 2001 (BC2001) trial had a biopsy only or an incomplete TURBT, and a similar proportion had a residual mass at time of treatment; despite this, the locoregional disease-free survival (DFS) was over 80 percent with chemoradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical T2 to T3a disease &ndash; Increasing tumor (T) stage is associated with decreased rates of complete response after chemoradiation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110763\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110763 \">table 1</a>). This was illustrated by a single-institution series of 348 patients, in which clinical T2 disease had a complete response rate of 81 percent compared with 64 percent in clinical T3 to T4 disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Although patients with clinical T2 to T3a disease may be more favorable candidates for CMT, the large institutional experiences, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) prospective studies, and BC2001 trial used clinical T4a disease (ie, disease extension into the prostatic stroma in men or <span class=\"nowrap\">uterus/vagina</span> in women) as the upper limit of clinical T stage acceptable for CMT. However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy is preferred for patients with extensive T3b or T4 disease in those patients that are appropriate surgical candidates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of tumor-associated hydronephrosis &ndash; Patients with tumor-associated hydronephrosis are less likely to achieve a complete remission to chemoradiation (64 percent in patients without hydronephrosis versus 38 percent in patients with hydronephrosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A large retrospective series of 348 patients treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital also suggests that patients with tumor-associated hydronephrosis (n = 58) fare worse with regard to overall and disease-specific survival outcomes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal function &ndash; Adequate renal function is necessary to receive cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapy. However, the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a> C (MMC) represents a reasonable alternative concurrent chemotherapy regimen for patients with compromised renal function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of extensive carcinoma in situ &ndash; In a single-institution experience of 40 patients, extensive carcinoma in situ (CIS) was associated with a trend toward a higher bladder tumor recurrence rate compared with those without CIS (40 versus 6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Furthermore, in a systemic review of bladder preservation in muscle-invasive bladder cancer, extensive CIS was found to be associated with a higher risk of local recurrence in patients treated with RT alone, although the association was less clear with CMT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unifocal tumors &lt;5 cm in maximum diameter</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Good bladder function and capacity (ie, a bladder worth sparing)</p><p/><p>Advanced age is not a contraindication for a combined-modality approach. While older patients are more likely to have significant comorbidities, a bladder preservation approach should be considered in this population given its generally good tolerability. In an analysis from a large single-institution experience, there was no difference in disease-specific survival for elderly patients (&ge;75 years) treated with a bladder preservation approach compared with a younger cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/24,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,32</a>]. Similarly, the RTOG pooled analysis showed no difference with respect to rates of complete response, disease-specific survival, or bladder-intact disease-specific survival in patients &ge;75 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>There may be some patients whose medical comorbidities or other patient factors make them poor candidates for chemotherapy in combination with RT. In this setting, TURBT followed by radiation alone is a reasonable treatment strategy. RT was used as bladder-sparing monotherapy for several decades in patients unfit for radical cystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/29,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,34-36</a>], and there exists a sizable group of patients with durable disease control with radiation alone (54 percent locoregional DFS at two years in the BC2001 study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]). However, level I evidence has clearly demonstrated the superiority of combined chemoradiation over radiation alone, and thus there is no group of patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer for whom we would recommend RT alone, if they are reasonable candidates for radiosensitizing chemotherapy.</p><p>With the availability of multiple chemotherapy options (including single agents rather than chemotherapy doublets) and with the use of radiosensitizing doses of systemic therapy, we are able to offer combined-modality therapy incorporating maximal TURBT followed by radiation therapy with concurrent radiosensitizing chemotherapy (rather than TURBT with RT alone) to the vast majority of patients.</p><p>New biomarkers may represent a promising strategy for identifying patients appropriate for bladder-preserving CMT. For example, MRE11 is a protein involved in detecting double-stranded DNA breaks along with RAD50-NBS1. A study analyzing pre-treatment tumor specimens from patients receiving radical treatment for their bladder cancer demonstrated that high MRE11 expression is associated with improved cancer-specific survival compared with radical cystectomy patients. This finding was validated in another cohort of patients, wherein elevated MRE11 expression was associated with improved cancer-specific survival in patients receiving CMT, but not in those managed with radical cystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4615511\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSURETHRAL RESECTION OF BLADDER TUMOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) is to maximally resect all visible tumor in a safe manner. Several technical maneuvers can be employed to assist in maximally safe TURBT, including use of paralytics for lateral bladder wall tumors to mitigate an obturator reflex, and avoiding bladder over-distension while resecting to decrease the risk of perforation. The depth of resection can often be safely extended through the detrusor muscle and into the perivesical adipose tissue by an experienced urologist if this is required to perform a visually complete TURBT. A bimanual examination under anesthesia (EUA) should be performed both before and after TURBT. A palpable three-dimensional mass on EUA prior to or after a maximal TURBT indicates locally advanced (T3 to T4) disease.</p><p>The post-induction (after 40 to 45 Gy radiation therapy [RT] with induction chemotherapy) and consolidation (after completion of the entire course of chemoradiotherapy) TURBT with EUA require special consideration. Often the previous resection site has significant fibrosis. A cold cup biopsy of the previous tumor site is frequently inadequate, and the previous resection site needs to be re-resected with a resectoscope with the goal of obtaining detrusor muscle to assess for residual invasive cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4615544\"><span class=\"h1\">CONCURRENT CHEMORADIATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87035539\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of chemoradiotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important data supporting the use of chemoradiotherapy come from a pooled analysis of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) studies, a large British randomized trial comparing chemoradiotherapy versus radiation therapy (RT) without chemotherapy, and two large single-institution series.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4615651\"><span class=\"h3\">RTOG pooled analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The RTOG has conducted six studies using variable radiation doses and schedules, as well as different concurrent chemotherapy regimens.</p><p>The results from these studies were combined in a 2014 pooled analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

An adequate dose of radiation is required to eradicate all tumor and to treat adjacent areas of bladder that are at high risk for local recurrence.

If a patient has a complete response or has only Ta or Tis residual disease that can be managed intravesically, consolidation concurrent chemoradiation is continued.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary diversion and reconstruction following cystectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When performing any type of diversion, special care must be taken to ensure that the segment of bowel selected has been spared apparent injury from radiation. If an ileal conduit is planned, often selecting more proximal ileum can avoid using a segment of bowel that lays closer to the pelvic radiation field. If the ileum is unsuitable, then a transverse colon conduit can be created.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Due to the potential need to use large bowel and the rare risk of rectal injury, all salvage cystectomy patients should have a preoperative mechanical bowel preparation. If there is a reasonable likelihood that large intestine will be needed for the urinary diversion, patients should have a recent colonoscopy prior to surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4617957\"><span class=\"h1\">QUALITY OF LIFE STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary objective of a combined-modality therapy (CMT) is bladder preservation, and bladder preservation has merit only if the preserved bladder and other pelvic organs function at acceptable levels after treatment. Patients should expect some degree of urinary irritative symptoms and bowel symptoms during treatment.</p><p>Overall, the available evidence supports the conclusion that the patients&rsquo; native bladders function well, and late pelvic toxicity remains acceptable after combined-modality bladder-preservation therapy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pooled analysis of four prospective Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trials evaluated 157 patients who underwent bladder-preserving CMT and survived at least two years with their bladder intact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. With a median follow-up of 5.4 years, 6 percent of patients experienced late (&ge;180 days after start of consolidation therapy) grade &ge;3 genitourinary toxicity, and 2 percent experienced grade &ge;3 gastrointestinal toxicity. There were no grade 4 toxicities and no treatment-related deaths. Only one patient had persistent grade 3 genitourinary toxicity after CMT, and &lt;1 percent of patients required cystectomy due to treatment-related toxicity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A patient-reported quality of life and urodynamics study of long-term survivors of bladder-preserving CMT showed that 75 percent of patients had normally functioning bladders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Six percent of patients reported difficulty with urinary flow, 15 percent with urinary urgency, 19 percent with incontinence, and 22 percent with bowel symptoms. Among men, 36 percent reported normal erections, and another 18 percent noted weaker erections that were still sufficient for intercourse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 226 long-term survivors with muscle-invasive bladder cancer compared patient-reported quality of life in patients treated with CMT versus radical cystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In multivariable analysis, patients who received CMT had significantly better general health-related quality of life than patients who had a radical cystectomy. CMT also had better bowel quality of life and equivalent urinary quality of life compared with radical cystectomy.</p><p/><p>However, the patient's baseline urinary function before treatment is an important consideration, since patients with very poor baseline urinary function may not have a &quot;bladder worth sparing.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4617964\"><span class=\"h1\">CONSENSUS GUIDELINES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple international bodies have developed consensus guidelines and recommendations for the use of combined-modality therapy (CMT) for muscle-invasive bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/55-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-58</a>]. The approach presented in this topic is consistent with these guidelines. In addition, several patient advocacy groups serve as good resources for providers and patients. For example, the Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network (BCAN) is a large community of advocates, bladder cancer survivors, and medical and research professionals that offers education and support to patients and providers and funding to advance research for bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4618027\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder-preserving combined-modality therapy (CMT) integrates maximal transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) followed by concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT) for patients who are medically unfit for radical cystectomy or who have a strong desire to preserve the native bladder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F112081\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112081 \">algorithm 1</a>). This combined-modality approach utilizing TURBT followed by RT with concurrent chemotherapy is often referred to as trimodality therapy (TMT).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Key factors important in patient selection include urothelial histology, the ability to achieve a complete tumor resection at TURBT, clinical stage T2 to T3a disease, and the absence of hydronephrosis. (See <a href=\"#H4615492\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are candidates for bladder preservation, we recommend concurrent chemoradiation rather than RT alone following maximal TURBT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is preferred, although the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a> C is an alternative, especially for patients who are not candidates for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H87035539\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of chemoradiotherapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4617894\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Careful post-treatment surveillance is essential for the detection of recurrence or a second primary urothelial malignancy in the urogenital tract. (See <a href=\"#H4617936\" class=\"local\">'Post-treatment surveillance and treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who fail to achieve a complete response or who develop an invasive recurrence after CMT, a salvage radical cystectomy is recommended and is associated with reasonable surgical outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H4617950\" class=\"local\">'Salvage cystectomy'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-preservation-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Siegel RL, Miller KD, Jemal A.
