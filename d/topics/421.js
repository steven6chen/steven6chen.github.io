For women with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer, treatment consists of a multidisciplinary approach that involves input from surgery, radiation oncology, and medical oncology.</p><p>The objective of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) is to eradicate any tumor deposits remaining following surgery for patients treated by either breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Doing so reduces risk of locoregional recurrence (LRR) and improves breast cancer-specific and overall survivals.</p><p>This topic will review the role of adjuvant RT. Where clinical guidance is provided in this topic, the anatomic staging system set forth in the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual is used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848 \">table 1</a>); however, it is recognized that the studies cited may have used previous editions of the staging system, which is a limitation of existing data.

This includes women treated with neoadjuvant therapy, even if they experienced a complete response to treatment.</p><p>As discussed below, adjuvant WBRT reduces the risks of recurrence and breast cancer death. (See <a href=\"#H601119812\" class=\"local\">'Whole breast radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>There are few exceptions to this approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For older women (typically defined as &ge;65 years) with node-negative, stage I and early node-negative stage II (with primary tumors up to 3 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who are treated with endocrine therapy, radiation therapy (RT) may reasonably be excluded. The risk of an in-breast recurrence is quite low for this population such that RT may not provide a clinically meaningful benefit. (See <a href=\"#H6797887\" class=\"local\">'Omission of radiation for older women with ER-positive breast cancer'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For certain women with small (&le;3 cm), hormone receptor-positive, lymph node-negative tumors who are &ge;50 years old, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) may be a reasonable alternative to WBRT. (See <a href=\"#H34415461\" class=\"local\">'Accelerated partial breast irradiation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>For most women receiving WBRT, we also offer an RT boost to the tumor bed to further reduce the risk of in-breast tumor recurrence. Possible exceptions include patients &ge;60 years old with small, low-grade, hormone receptor-positive tumors resected with negative margins. (See <a href=\"#H8949393\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy boost to the tumor bed'</a> below.)</p><p>For women who have involved lymph nodes and high-risk primary tumors, regional nodal radiation may also be indicated. (See <a href=\"#H646833320\" class=\"local\">'Indications for regional nodal irradiation'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy receive WBRT regardless of their pathologic response.

These benefits of WBRT are demonstrated by the 2011 meta-analysis performed by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists&rsquo; Collaborative Group (EBCTCG), which included over 10,000 women (known to be either pathologically node-negative or positive) in 17 trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The main results of the meta-analysis were that WBRT resulted in:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A nearly 50 percent reduction in the 10-year risk of any first recurrence compared with breast-conserving surgery alone (19 versus 35 percent, respectively, relative risk [RR] 0.52, 95% CI 0.48-0.56). The reduction in recurrence rate associated with RT was due to a decrease in locoregional rather than distant recurrences.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reduction in the 15-year risk of breast cancer death (21 versus 25 percent, RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.75-0.90).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116268643\"><span class=\"h3\">Risks and toxicities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>WBRT is associated with acute toxicities that involve the area treated (eg, skin, muscle, and internal organs), although these complications are relatively uncommon. WBRT can also result in long-term complications, including cardiotoxicity, lung injury, and second malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], which can occur many years after treatment has been completed. However, improvements in radiation techniques over time have likely reduced long-term toxicities. Further discussion of specific late toxicities is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patterns-of-relapse-and-long-term-complications-of-therapy-in-breast-cancer-survivors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patterns of relapse and long-term complications of therapy in breast cancer survivors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiotoxicity of radiation therapy for breast cancer and other malignancies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As an example of frequency of early toxicities, among 294 patients treated with surgery and RT at one institution, 29 patients (9.9 percent) had grade 2 or higher complications at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These included arm edema (4 percent), breast skin fibrosis (4 percent), decreased range of motion (1 percent), and pneumonitis (0.6 percent). One patient each experienced fat necrosis and rib fracture.</p><p>Management of these issues may require ongoing care beyond the completion of radiation. Physical therapy may assist in management of decreased range of motion associated with scarring and fibrosis. One trial found that six months of treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a> and vitamin E reduced skin fibrosis compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Further discussion of evaluation and management of lymphedema is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema#H2083648067\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of peripheral lymphedema&quot;, section on 'Radiation therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical staging and conservative management of peripheral lymphedema&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H709652497\"><span class=\"h3\">Dosing and schedule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women receive conventionally dosed WBRT, which is delivered to the entire breast in 1.8 to 2 Gy daily fractions over 4.5 to 5 weeks to a total dose of 45 to 50 Gy. Another option is a shorter fractionation (&quot;hypofractionated&quot;) schedule, which has been associated with fewer toxicities, and is a reasonable choice for many patients. In general, a hypofractionated regimen delivers more radiation per dose, but the overall treatment duration is shorter (40 to 42.5 Gy in approximately three to five weeks with or without a boost). We agree with the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) that use of hypofractionated RT should be strongly encouraged in women who meet all of the following criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aged 50 years or older</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With pT1-2N0 breast cancer</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With estrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease treated primarily with adjuvant hormonal therapy systemically</p><p/><p>Cosmetic and disease outcomes have been equivalent between hypofractionated and conventional schedules.

This was irrespective of age, type of primary surgery, axillary node status, tumor grade, administration of adjuvant chemotherapy, or the use of a tumor-bed boost RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Despite these results, several caveats apply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional studies are needed to more fully evaluate both efficacy and toxicity in certain subgroups, particularly for those with more advanced tumors (T-size &gt;5 cm) and positive nodes. Available evidence, however, suggests good tolerability of hypofractionated RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are insufficient data to evaluate the tolerability of shorter fractionation when used with other therapies (ie, chemotherapy or monoclonal antibodies).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8949393\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation therapy boost to the tumor bed</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RT boost to the tumor bed is intended to decrease locoregional recurrence rates. While RT to the tumor bed following breast-conserving surgery and WBRT is recommended in younger women, its routine use in older women is less clear. In our practice, we generally treat all women with an RT boost after WBRT, except for women aged 60 and older with stage 0 to I luminal phenotypes resected with negative margins, for whom it is optional. The degree of benefit and the associated potential skin toxicities following a boost in patients who had received hypofractionated RT are unclear. The decision to give a boost in these patients should be made after a discussion between the patient and the treating radiation oncologist.</p><p>If an RT boost is administered, 10 to 14 Gy in either 2 Gy or 2.5 Gy fractions is usually administered, with boost dose, in part, dependent upon the dose and fractionation delivered to the whole breast. Technical aspects of delivering an RT boost are covered separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-for-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques for newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Two trials that evaluated the impact of an RT boost suggest that it results in a lower rate of recurrences and as a result, a lower rate of subsequent mastectomies; however, there is no appreciable benefit in overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In the largest trial that included women with stage I or II breast cancer undergoing WBRT, patients were randomly assigned to an RT boost or no further treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Of note, the majority of patients (95.5 percent) in this trial had negative resection margins. With 17.2-year median follow-up, among women with a negative resection margin (n = 5318), an RT boost resulted in [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A significant reduction in the local recurrence rate (9 versus 13 percent in those who did not receive a boost; hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% CI 0.52-81).

However, the absolute magnitude of the reduction was greatest in younger women (&le;50 years) with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) present (15 versus 31 percent among such women who did not receive a boost, HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22-0.62) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lower rate of mastectomy as first salvage for those with in-breast tumor recurrence (75 versus 79 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No difference in overall survival, breast cancer mortality, or disease-free survival (DFS) at 20 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A higher rate of severe fibrosis (5.2 versus 1.8 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34415461\"><span class=\"h2\">Accelerated partial breast irradiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>APBI refers to the use of limited, focused RT as a more convenient alternative to conventional WBRT for women following breast-conserving surgery. Compared with WBRT, APBI delivers a higher dose of RT per day to a limited volume of tissue, encompassing the lumpectomy bed with margin over a shorter period of time and leading to potentially fewer late skin side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Five-year local relapse rates were 1.1 percent in the control group, 0.2 percent in the reduced-dose group, and 0.5 percent in the partial-breast group, differences that were not statistically significant. Several caveats exist in interpretation of this study, eg, this study did not use an accelerated treatment schedule and so is a trial of PBI rather than APBI; the volume of breast tissue irradiated was larger than in many trials evaluating APBI; and finally, patients enrolled were low-risk, with widely negative surgical margins (2 mm or more) and with the great majority (approximately 90 percent or more) of tumors being node-negative, ER-positive, grade 1 or 2, and lacking lymphovascular invasion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As another example, in a trial of over 500 patients with tumors up to 2.5 cm randomly assigned to APBI with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) versus WBRT, the rates of in-breast tumor recurrence were the same between the groups (1.5 percent), with similar five-year overall survival rates as well (99 versus 97 percent, and HR of dying 0.17, 95% CI 0.02-1.36 among patients treated with ABPI versus WBRT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, in a separate trial nearly 1200 women who had undergone breast-conserving surgery for low-risk breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ were randomly assigned to ABPI versus WBRT with tumor bed boost and found to have similar rates of recurrence (1.44 versus 0.92 percent, respectively, absolute difference 0.52 percent, 95% CI 0.72-1.75 percent), as well as 5-year overall survival (95.6 versus 97.3 percent, respectively, absolute difference 1.72 percent, 95% CI -0.44 to 3.88) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The five-year risk of late side effects was similar between the two groups in this study.

Several issues limit the applicability of this meta-analysis, namely that there was little consistency among these trials with respect to patient selection criteria, APBI techniques, and target volume definition; there was no long-term data collection; and techniques were not consistent with contemporary practice in all the studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4040957\"><span class=\"h3\">Risks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some studies have suggested that APBI may be associated with a greater toxicity profile compared with WBRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/26,30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,30-34</a>], while others do not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/23,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,35</a>]. A population-based cohort study from the National Medicare Database included over 92,000 women age 67 years or older with invasive breast cancer and demonstrated that treatment with APBI using brachytherapy was associated with a higher incidence of acute toxicities compared with WBRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. These included higher rates of postoperative infections and noninfectious complications, breast pain, fat necrosis, and rib fractures. In addition, women receiving APBI had a higher incidence of subsequent mastectomy at five years. However, without clarifying the indication for subsequent mastectomy, it is unclear whether the higher incidence associated with brachytherapy was due to toxicity or other factors, such as local recurrence.</p><p>The findings from this National Medicare Database study should be interpreted cautiously because multiple factors limit this analysis.

The first is whether axillary dissection versus axillary RT should be performed for control of disease in the axilla. This is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the regional lymph nodes in breast cancer&quot;, section on 'RT versus ALND'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer#H164839\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Management after sentinel lymph node biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>The second decision is whether regional nodal RT (to the infra- and supraclavicular nodes and internal mammary nodes) should be performed. While regional RT may reduce the risk of locoregional recurrences, the added toxicities (potential lymphedema, fibrosis, etc.) may outweigh potential benefits for patients with a lower absolute risk for recurrence. Therefore, our approach is to utilize regional RT for patients with higher-risk disease, for whom the absolute risk reduction is expected to be greater. Indications for regional RT are discussed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lymph node involvement </strong>&ndash; While experts agree that for women with more than three involved lymph nodes, regional RT should be delivered, there is some controversy in regards to patients with one to three involved lymph nodes.

An example of this is intraoperative radiation<strong> </strong>therapy (IORT), which condenses the entire therapeutic dose into a single fraction, permitting surgery and radiation to be completed in one day. At this time, however, we suggest that use of IORT be limited to a clinical trial because the available data suggest an association with a higher risk of in-breast tumor recurrences (IBTR). For patients in whom the duration of therapy required for standard WBRT is a concern, hypofractionated WBRT schedules are a viable option.

Specifically, this includes women aged 65 years or older with clinically node-negative, small (T size &lt;3 cm) breast cancer who are willing to initiate adjuvant endocrine therapy. Patients should understand that without RT, the rate of in-breast recurrence may be higher over time and the rate of requiring subsequent mastectomy may be higher. Therefore, such patients should be referred to a radiation oncologist to discuss the pros and cons of endocrine therapy alone versus endocrine therapy plus RT. Ultimately, the decision to omit RT should take into account potential comorbidities that could affect long-term survival.

No differences in overall survival, regional recurrence, distant metastases, contralateral breast cancers, or new breast cancers were noted between the two groups.</p><p>The impact of adjuvant RT on the need for a subsequent mastectomy for recurrence in women older than 70 years is not clear, as data are conflicting.

In general, we favor postmastectomy RT for women with positive lymph nodes. The magnitude of the benefit and the strength of the recommendation depends upon the number of nodes involved. For women with more than three involved lymph nodes, we recommend postmastectomy RT to the chest wall and regional nodes. Postmastectomy RT is the subject of some debate when there are one to three involved axillary lymph nodes (N1 disease). We generally proceed with postmastectomy RT for these women in order to maximize the opportunity to reduce the risk of recurrence and potentially improve disease-specific survival. However, given that the absolute magnitude of benefit derived depends on the baseline risk of locoregional failure, we recommend an individualized approach taking into account patient preference and high-risk features, in accordance with society guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Rationale for this approach comes from the 2005 Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) meta-analysis, which included 8500 patients with mastectomy, axillary dissection, and node-positive disease enrolled in trials of radiotherapy (generally to the chest wall and regional lymph nodes) versus no radiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. For women with node-positive disease, postmastectomy RT resulted in improved breast cancer-specific survival (54.7 versus 60.1 percent with no RT) and reduced local recurrence at 15 years (7.8 versus 29 percent with no RT).</p><p>While the 2005 EBCTCG meta-analysis discussed above supports postmastectomy RT for node-positive disease, detailed results for women with one to three involved nodes were not provided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Data in support of postmastectomy RT for these patients come from a 2014 EBCTCG meta-analysis of trials between 1964 and 1986 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. This analysis included approximately 1300 women with one to three involved lymph nodes receiving mastectomy and axillary dissection, and demonstrated that radiotherapy to the chest wall and regional nodes reduced locoregional recurrence (3.8 versus 20.3 percent), overall recurrence (34 versus 45.7 percent, rate ratio [RR] 0.68, 95% CI 0.57-0.82), and breast cancer mortality (42 versus 50 percent, RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.67-0.95). However, these data must be cautiously interpreted, as they were taken from trials where either no systemic therapy was given or less than contemporary systemic regimens were used. Therefore, the outcomes were worse in the control groups compared with what are currently observed. Additional data come from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) <span class=\"nowrap\">22922/10925</span> trial discussed above, which included almost 1000 patients who had undergone a mastectomy, the majority of whom had fewer than four involved lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], as well as the British Columbia series, in which postmastectomy radiation improved breast cancer-free survival among premenopausal women with node-positive disease, regardless of whether they had four or one to three involved nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Retrospective data suggest that among patients with one to three involved lymph nodes, there may be some who are less likely to benefit from postmastectomy RT. An observational study from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, which included over 90,000 patients who underwent mastectomy for tumors smaller than 5 centimeters with one to three involved lymph nodes, suggested that postmastectomy RT improved mortality among patients with three involved lymph nodes, as well as those with two involved lymph nodes and a primary tumor larger than 2 cm (hazard ratio [HR] 0.86, 95% CI 0.81-0.91). No beneficial effect was observed in patients with one involved lymph node, or in those with two involved lymph nodes and a primary tumor smaller than 2 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In the absence of prospective data to confirm these observations, however, we continue to treat patients with N1 disease with postmastectomy RT, regardless of whether they have one or more involved lymph nodes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H646833302\"><span class=\"h4\">Exception for micrometastatic nodal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data are limited in regards to postmastectomy RT for micrometastatic disease to the lymph nodes. We typically approach micrometastatic disease to the lymph nodes similarly to node-negative disease, with RT decisions based on the presence of other high-risk features.

However, patients with positive margins at mastectomy should receive chest wall radiation. In addition, in women with high-risk cancers such as T4 and non-luminal T3 disease, we suggest that RT be administered to the chest wall and regional nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/57,63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,63,64</a>].

These studies included node-positive as well as high-risk, node-negative disease (defined as tumors that were &gt;5 cm or invaded the skin or fascia) and demonstrated improved disease-free and overall survival associated with RT among women treated with RT after mastectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. It should be noted that the number of patients with node-negative disease was small in these studies (approximately 130 women in each Danish study).</p><p>The limited data that exist for postmastectomy RT in triple-negative disease suggest a benefit to treatment; however, these data require independent confirmation before postmastectomy RT is uniformly administered to women with triple-negative breast cancer who lack other high-risk features. In a randomized trial of 681 women with triple-negative breast cancer treated with mastectomy (82 percent node-negative) and adjuvant chemotherapy with or without postmastectomy RT, at a median follow-up of 86 months, women who received postmastectomy chest wall RT had significantly better five-year relapse-free survival (88 versus 75 percent) and overall survival (90 versus 79 percent) compared with those who received chemotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2599828674\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for patients who received neoadjuvant therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We treat patients with any degree of residual macroscopic nodal disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with postmastectomy RT, based on retrospective evidence suggesting a higher rate of recurrence in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. We also offer postmastectomy RT to patients with residual breast disease, though our threshold to omit treatment in such patients is lower than for patients with residual nodal disease. In the absence of prospective data to guide our approach to patients with a complete response to neoadjuvant treatment, we treat patients who presented with stage III disease with postmastectomy RT, regardless of response. For patients presenting with stage II disease, we evaluate pretreatment risk factors as well as the patient&rsquo;s response to neoadjuvant therapy, with a lower threshold to omit treatment for those patients who have a complete response.</p><p>Retrospective data in women with stage III disease suggest that postoperative RT improves local control even for patients who have a pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/67-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-73</a>]. As an example, in one retrospective study that included over 670 women treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by mastectomy, postmastectomy RT was associated with a significantly lower rate of locoregional recurrence at 10 years (22 versus 11 percent) and a lower risk of death from breast cancer (HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.34-0.71) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Among the 46 patients who presented with stage III or IV disease and achieved a pCR with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, postmastectomy radiation was associated with a reduced 10-year rate of locoregional recurrence (3 versus 33 percent among patients not receiving postmastectomy RT).</p><p>By contrast, other retrospective data suggest that certain lower-risk patients who achieve a pCR with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) have low rates of locoregional recurrence following mastectomy without the use of postmastectomy RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. For example, a large retrospective study of 3000 women treated with mastectomy with or without postmastectomy RT found that postmastectomy RT was associated with a modest reduction in 10-year locoregional recurrence rates (10.3 versus 12.6 percent among patients who did not receive postmastectomy radiation), with predictors of recurrence being clinical node involvement prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, residual cancer in the breast or lymph nodes after neoadjuvant therapy, and presenting tumor size &gt;5 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Patients lacking these features were at low risk of locoregional recurrence.</p><p>These results are from retrospective analyses of prospective trials studying the effect of different chemotherapy regimens, and the use of RT was at the discretion of the treating oncologist.

This is because radiation can be damaging to either a permanent implant or to an autologous tissue breast reconstruction, and it is therefore preferable to delay these procedures until after radiation. These issues are discussed in more detail elsewhere.

However, an individualized approach is necessary that takes into account the patient&rsquo;s risk for IMN involvement, her anatomy, and the ability of the treating radiation oncologist to ensure that critical structures (eg, the heart) are excluded from the treatment field.</p><p>Like the axillary lymph nodes, the IMN receive lymph drainage from all quadrants of the breast, although the risk for IMN involvement is highest with medially located breast cancers. In addition, among patients who have pathologically node-negative axillary disease, up to 10 percent may harbor regional metastases to the IMN. This risk rises to almost 40 percent if patients have axillary node-positive breast cancers, especially if the primary tumor is located in the inner or central breast.

Additionally, the MA.20 and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 22922 studies discussed above that demonstrate a benefit of regional nodal RT after breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy also lend indirect support for IMNRT, which was included as part of the standard RT field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. The improvement in locoregional control with regional RT may have been at least in part a result of the inclusion of the IMN, particularly in axillary node-positive disease.

Doing so reduces risk of locoregional recurrence and improves breast cancer-specific and overall survivals. Recommendations on adjuvant RT depend on the type of surgery received, extent of disease, and other patient factors. (See <a href=\"#H34414715\" class=\"local\">'Patients treated with breast-conserving surgery'</a> above and <a href=\"#H34414723\" class=\"local\">'Patients treated with mastectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1088120338\"><span class=\"h2\">Women treated with breast-conserving surgery</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most women treated with breast-conserving surgery, we recommend whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT). There are a few possible exceptions to this approach (see <a href=\"#H601119812\" class=\"local\">'Whole breast radiation therapy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women &ge;65 years old with node-negative, hormone receptor-positive primary tumors up to 3 cm for whom endocrine therapy is planned, RT may reasonably be excluded. (See <a href=\"#H6797887\" class=\"local\">'Omission of radiation for older women with ER-positive breast cancer'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women who are &ge;50 years old with small (&le;3 cm), hormone receptor-positive, node-negative tumors, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) or partial breast irradiation (PBI) may be a reasonable alternative to WBRT. (See <a href=\"#H34415461\" class=\"local\">'Accelerated partial breast irradiation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most women receiving WBRT after breast-conserving surgery, we recommend RT boost to the tumor bed to further reduce the risk of in-breast tumor recurrence. Possible exceptions include patients &ge;60 years old with small, low-grade, hormone receptor-positive tumors resected with negative margins. (See <a href=\"#H8949393\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy boost to the tumor bed'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who have involved lymph nodes and high-risk primary tumors, we suggest regional nodal RT. Our approach to regional nodal RT includes treatment of the supraclavicular and infraclavicular nodes as well as the internal mammary nodes. We also include RT to the axilla (except in patients who underwent complete axillary dissection). (See <a href=\"#H646833320\" class=\"local\">'Indications for regional nodal irradiation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we treat with WBRT, regardless of response. For patients with residual nodal disease and for those who presented with stage III disease (regardless of response), we additionally treat the regional nodes. For patients presenting with stage II disease who have a complete response to neoadjuvant therapy, an individualized approach toward regional nodal irradiation based on pretreatment risk factors is necessary. (See <a href=\"#H3615623282\" class=\"local\">'Patients who received neoadjuvant therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3059798609\"><span class=\"h2\">Women treated with mastectomy</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among women who do not receive neoadjuvant therapy prior to mastectomy, we suggest postmastectomy RT for women with positive lymph nodes and for women with high-risk, node-negative disease. (See <a href=\"#H646832114\" class=\"local\">'Indications for patients who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among women receiving neoadjuvant therapy, we suggest postmastectomy RT for patients with residual nodal disease, residual breast disease, or stage III disease on presentation. For patients presenting with stage II disease who have a complete response to neoadjuvant therapy, an individualized approach based on pretreatment risk factors is necessary. (See <a href=\"#H2599828674\" class=\"local\">'Indications for patients who received neoadjuvant therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We deliver postmastectomy RT to both the chest wall and to the regional nodes. These include the supraclavicular and infraclavicular nodes as well as the internal mammary nodes. We also include RT to the axilla, except in patients who underwent complete axillary dissection. (See <a href=\"#H2231572055\" class=\"local\">'Postmastectomy RT fields'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1803502559\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of RT</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated, RT is generally administered after its completion. For patients in whom adjuvant endocrine therapy is indicated, RT can be given concurrently or prior to its initiation. For patients in whom <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> is indicated, RT is given concurrently.
