Exposure to poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac causes more cases of allergic contact dermatitis than all other plant families combined.</p><p>People of all ethnicities and skin types are at risk for developing poison ivy dermatitis. The severity of the reaction decreases with age, especially in people who have had mild reactions in the past. People in occupations such as firefighting, forestry, and farming are at a higher risk of poison ivy dermatitis because of repeated exposure to toxic plants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">POISON IVY DERMATITIS CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac plants contain a compound called urushiol, which is a light, colorless oil that is found in the fruit, leaves, stem, roots, and sap of the plant. When urushiol is exposed to air, it turns brown and then black; plant leaves develop small black spots.</p><p>There are several ways that you can be exposed to urushiol:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By touching the sap or rubbing against the leaves of the toxic plant at any time of year</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By touching something that has urushiol on it, such as animal fur or garden tools</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By breathing in smoke when toxic plants are burned</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ginkgo fruit and the skin of mangoes also contain urushiol and can produce symptoms similar to poison ivy dermatitis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">IDENTIFYING POISON IVY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Leaves of three, let them be&quot; is a phrase often used to identify plants that cause poison ivy dermatitis. Generally, poison ivy and poison oak have three leaflets per leaf with flowering branches on a single stem. Poison sumac has five, seven, or more leaflets per leaf that angle upward toward the top of the stem (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79136\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79136 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82260%7EPI%2F59717%7EPI%2F68304\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82260 graphicRef59717 graphicRef68304 \">picture 1A-C</a>).</p><p>Poison ivy plants produce a green or off-white fruit in autumn, and in some cases, black dots form on the plants' leaves. It is not always possible to identify the plant by the leaves alone since the appearance can vary depending upon the season, growth cycle, region, and climate.</p><p>Poison ivy, oak, and sumac plants grow in many areas across the United States and throughout the world. East of the Rocky Mountains, poison ivy commonly grows as a climbing vine. In the Rocky Mountain area and west, poison ivy tends to grow low to the ground as a shrub. Western poison oak grows west of the Rocky Mountains and eastern poison oak grows in the southeast United States. Poison sumac inhabits boggy areas in the southeastern part of the United States. The plants are not usually found in areas at high elevations or in desert climates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">POISON IVY SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After contact with urushiol, approximately 50 percent of people develop signs and symptoms of poison ivy dermatitis. The symptoms and severity differ from person to person.</p><p>The most common signs and symptoms of poison ivy dermatitis are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intense itching</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin redness</p><p/><p>These symptoms usually develop within four hours to four days after exposure to the urushiol. After the initial symptoms, allergic individuals develop fluid-filled blisters in a line or streak-like pattern. The symptoms are worse within 1 to 14 days after touching the plant, but they can develop up to 21 days later if one has never been exposed to urushiol before.</p><p>The blisters can occur at different times in different people; blisters can develop on the arms several days after blisters on the hands developed. This does not mean that the reaction is spreading from one area of the body to the other. The fluid that leaks from blisters does <strong>not</strong> spread the rash. Poison ivy dermatitis is <strong>not</strong> contagious and cannot be passed from person to person. However, urushiol can be carried under fingernails and on clothes; if another person comes in contact with the urushiol, he or she can develop poison ivy dermatitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">POISON IVY DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Poison ivy is usually diagnosed based upon how the skin looks. Further testing is not usually necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">POISON IVY TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Poison ivy dermatitis usually resolves within one to three weeks without treatment. Treatments that may help relieve the itching, soreness, and discomfort caused by poison ivy dermatitis include:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For some people, adding oatmeal to a bath, applying cool wet compresses, and applying <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calamine-lotion-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">calamine lotion</a> may help to relieve itching. Once the blisters begin weeping fluid, astringents containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aluminum-acetate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aluminum acetate</a> (Burow's solution) and Domeboro may help to relieve the rash.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Antihistamines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antihistamines <strong>do not</strong> help to relieve itching caused by poison ivy dermatitis. Some antihistamines make you sleepy while others do not. The ones that make you sleepy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">diphenhydramine</a> [sample brand name Benadryl]) can help you to ignore the itch while sleeping.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Steroid creams</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Steroid creams may be helpful if they are used during the first few days after symptoms develop. Low-potency steroid creams, such as 1% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hydrocortisone</a> (available in the United States without prescription) are not usually helpful. A stronger prescription formula may be helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Steroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you develop severe symptoms or the rash covers a large area (especially on the face or genitals), you may need steroid pills (eg, prednisone) or injections (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">budesonide</a>) to help relieve itching and swelling. Pills are usually given for 14 to 21 days, with the dosage slowly decreased over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin infections are a potential complication of poison ivy, especially if you scratch your skin. If you develop a skin infection because of poison ivy dermatitis, you may need antibiotics to treat the infection. Do not use over-the-counter topical antibiotic creams; many bacteria are resistant to them <strong>and</strong> they are one of the chief causes of allergic contact dermatitis not caused by plants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Other treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should not use antihistamine creams or lotions, anesthetic creams containing benzocaine, or antibiotic creams containing neomycin or bacitracin to the skin. These creams or ointments could make the rash worse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">POISON IVY RASH PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best way to prevent poison ivy dermatitis is to identify and avoid the plants that cause it. These plants can irritate the skin year round, even during the winter months, and they can still cause a reaction after dying.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear protective clothing, including long sleeves and pants, when working in areas where toxic plants may be found. Keep in mind that the resin and oils from the toxic plants can be carried on clothing, pets, and under fingernails.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear heavy-duty vinyl gloves when doing yard work or gardening. The oils from toxic plants can seep through latex or rubber gloves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After coming in contact with poison ivy, remove any contaminated clothing and gently wash (do not scrub or rub) your skin and under your fingernails with mild soap and water as soon as possible. Washing within 10 minutes after exposure can reduce the likelihood and severity of symptoms; washing the skin after 10 minutes of exposure typically will not help.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Creams and ointments that create a barrier between the skin and the urushiol oil may be somewhat effective for people who are frequently exposed to poison ivy. Bentoquatam (Ivy Block) is one type of barrier cream that may prevent poison ivy dermatitis. It must be reapplied every four hours and it leaves a clay residue on the skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid burning poisonous vegetation, which can disperse the plant particles in the smoke, irritate the skin, and cause poison ivy dermatitis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=7632\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
