This is the most common form of hydrocephalus in children and is almost always associated with increased intracranial pressure (ICP). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Obstruction'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Communicating hydrocephalus</strong> &ndash; Communicating hydrocephalus refers to CSF accumulation due to impaired absorption that occurs in the subarachnoid spaces. Rarely, CSF accumulates because of excessive production. Communicating hydrocephalus is also typically associated with increased ICP.

The choroid plexus tissue is located in each cerebral ventricle and consists of villous folds lined by epithelium with a central core of highly vascularized connective tissue. The choroidal epithelial cells produce CSF using active transport dependent upon carbonic anhydrase, which can be blocked by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetazolamide</a> (Diamox), a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. In addition to the active secretion, there is a diffusion component that is not blocked by acetazolamide.</p><p>The remainder of the CSF is produced by cerebral tissue, which secretes CSF directly into the extracellular space. This fluid flows through the ependymal layer into the cerebral ventricles or the spinal central canal.</p><p>CSF production rates are constant in physiological conditions unless extremely high levels of intracranial pressure (ICP) are reached. Thus, absorption of CSF generally matches the rate of production to accommodate the volume of CSF being formed each day. In adults, the production rate of CSF is approximately 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour,</span> which results in complete turnover of the CSF three or four times per day. In newborns and young children, the CSF production rate is proportional to the size of the brain. Estimates of CSF production rates in infants and children are derived from measurements of the hourly output of the CSF from external ventricular drains. These studies suggest that CSF output increases logarithmically with age and body weight, ranging from 0.1 to 26.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-physiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Output increases rapidly in infancy; by the age of two years, output is approximately two-thirds of adult levels.</p><p>The total volume of CSF in the newborn is approximately 50 mL, compared with 125 to 150 mL in a healthy adult. In adults, approximately 25 percent of the CSF is within the ventricular system.

The ventricular system is comprised of a pair of lateral ventricles, each of which connects to the midline third ventricle through an interventricular foramen (of Monro) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74410\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74410 \">figure 2</a>). There are no direct connections between two lateral ventricles because they are separated by a membrane (the septum pellucidum). The third ventricle is connected to a midline fourth ventricle by the cerebral aqueduct (of Sylvius). The CSF exits from the fourth ventricle into the subarachnoid space via three foramen: the paired lateral foramina of Luschka and a midline foramen of Magendie. Focally enlarged areas of subarachnoid spaces known as cisterns are present at the base of the brain. The cisterns in the posterior fossa connect to the subarachnoid spaces over the cerebral convexities through pathways that cross the tentorium. The basal cisterns connect the spinal and intracranial subarachnoid spaces.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">CSF absorption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is absorbed into the systemic venous circulation primarily across the arachnoid villi into the venous channels of the major sinuses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57840\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57840 \">figure 1</a>). The arachnoid villi consist of a cluster of cells that project from the subarachnoid space to the sinus lumen; these are covered by a layer of endothelium with tight junctions that are continuous with the inner layer of the sinuses. This assembly acts as a one-way valve, allowing passive absorption of CSF down a pressure gradient; if the CSF pressure is less than the venous pressure, the arachnoid villi close and do not allow blood to pass into the ventricular system. The rate of absorption is relatively linear over the physiological range. Some CSF absorption also occurs across the ependymal lining of the ventricles and the choroid plexus, as well as from the spinal subarachnoid space to the perineural spaces. </p><p>In addition to these well-described transport mechanisms, other pathways that may be involved in the movement of CSF include perivascular pathways and dura-associated lymphatic vessels. However, the role of these lymphatic pathways has not been elucidated. These issues are discussed in greater detail separately.

It is caused by obstruction of CSF circulation, by inadequate absorption of CSF, or (rarely) by overproduction of the CSF. Regardless of the cause, the excessive volume of CSF causes increased ventricular pressure and leads to ventricular dilatation.</p><p>It is increasingly recognized that many cases of hydrocephalus have both obstructive and absorptive components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-physiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This accounts for the variable response to third ventriculostomy for cases of hydrocephalus previously presumed to be purely obstructive, as discussed separately. Moreover, the absorptive component of the hydrocephalus and the response to treatment may change over time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis#H548807590\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydrocephalus in children: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Endoscopic third ventriculostomy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common mechanism of hydrocephalus is anatomic or functional obstruction to CSF flow (known as obstructive or non-communicating hydrocephalus). The obstruction occurs at the foramen of Monro, at the aqueduct of Sylvius, or at the fourth ventricle and its outlets. Dilatation of the ventricular system occurs proximal to the obstruction. The ventricle just proximal to the obstruction usually dilates most prominently. Examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstruction of the aqueduct of Sylvius (aqueductal stenosis) causes dilation of the lateral and third ventricles, while the size of the fourth ventricle remains relatively normal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111226\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111226 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78793\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78793 \">image 3</a>).

This is typically due to inflammation of the subarachnoid villi but also may be caused by impaired CSF absorption or increased pressure in the venous sinuses. The radiographic hallmark of communicating hydrocephalus is dilation of the entire ventricular system, including the fourth ventricle. Impaired CSF absorption also can occur when cranial venous sinus pressure is elevated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Excessive production</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive production of CSF is a rare cause of hydrocephalus. This condition may occur with a functional choroid plexus papilloma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60156\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60156 \">image 7</a>). It leads to enlargement of the entire ventricular system and of the subarachnoid spaces, with a radiographic appearance that is similar to communicating hydrocephalus from other causes. (See <a href=\"#H434112\" class=\"local\">'Choroid plexus papilloma or carcinoma'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of hydrocephalus depends upon the underlying cause, how quickly the condition develops, and the presence or absence of compensatory mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hydrocephalus that begins in infancy before fusion of the cranial sutures, if untreated, typically results in marked enlargement of the head and in less compromise of brain tissue, compared with hydrocephalus that develops acutely. This is because the skull expands, partially relieving the intracranial pressure (ICP). In addition, the force of the ICP is distributed over the greater surface area of an enlarged ventricular system, so there is less pressure on the brain parenchyma compared with hydrocephalus that develops in a ventricular system that is not previously enlarged.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If hydrocephalus occurs acutely or occurs after fusion of the cranial sutures, the head does not enlarge. This results in significantly increased ICP and in more rapid destruction of brain tissue.</p><p/><p>The progression of ventricular dilatation is usually uneven. The frontal and occipital horns typically enlarge first and to the greatest extent. Their progressive enlargement disrupts the ependymal lining of the ventricles, allowing the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to move directly into the brain tissue. This reduces CSF pressure but also leads to edema of the subependymal areas and to progressive involvement of the white matter.</p><p>As the hydrocephalus progresses, edema and ischemia develop in the periventricular brain tissue, leading to atrophy of the white matter. The gyri become flattened, and the sulci become compressed against the cranium, obliterating the subarachnoid space over the hemispheres. The width of the cerebral mantle may be substantially reduced; gray matter is better preserved than white matter, even in advanced stages. The vascular system is compressed, and the venous pressure in the dural sinuses increases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hydrocephalus can be congenital or acquired.

Communicating hydrocephalus is less common and occurs when CSF accumulates because of impaired absorption or rarely because of excessive CSF production. (See <a href=\"#H614877415\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The reported prevalence of congenital and infantile hydrocephalus in the United States and Europe ranges from 0.5 to 0.8 per 1000 live and still births. Approximately 15 to 25 percent of these cases are associated with myelomeningocele (spina bifida). Additional factors associated with an increased risk of infantile hydrocephalus include low birth weight, prematurity, maternal diabetes, low socioeconomic status, male sex, <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity</span> (the risk is decreased in Asians), and positive family history. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Untreated hydrocephalus that begins in infancy before fusion of the cranial sutures typically results in marked enlargement of the head and in less compromise of brain tissue compared with hydrocephalus that develops acutely. This is because the skull expands, partially relieving the intracranial pressure. As hydrocephalus progresses, edema and ischemia develop in the periventricular brain tissue, leading to atrophy of the white matter. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common causes of congenital hydrocephalus include intraventricular hemorrhage and neural tube defects, including myelomeningocele.
