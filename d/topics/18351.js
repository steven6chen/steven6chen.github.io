Pathologic invasion of the urothelium can then occur and is aided by bacterial virulence structures, such as P fimbriae, that promote adhesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infection-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The absence of a sphincter between the transplanted ureter and the native bladder can predispose kidney transplant recipients to developing transplant pyelonephritis. Ureteral stents placed during transplantation and renal cysts in patients with polycystic kidney disease can serve as reservoirs for bacteria and predispose patients to developing recurrent UTIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infection-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/3,4,6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,6,9</a>].

Gram-positive bacteria such as <em>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</em>, <em>Streptococcus </em>species, and <em>Corynebacterium urealyticum </em>can all cause UTI but are rare causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infection-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H513526268\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to detect potential UTIs as early as possible among transplant recipients, particularly those who are within three months of transplantation. Untreated UTI that occurs within three months posttransplant is associated with an increased risk of allograft rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infection-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12584941\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>We screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria up until three months after transplantation. The rationale for screening is that we treat asymptomatic bacteriuria in order to prevent symptomatic UTIs. Symptomatic UTIs have been associated with early graft dysfunction (see <a href=\"#H3560447\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic bacteriuria'</a> below). However, there are no good data that have conclusively shown that either screening or treating asymptomatic UTIs prevents symptomatic UTIs.</p><p>In order to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria, we obtain a urine culture with an accompanying urinalysis with microscopy at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks posttransplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infection-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>We do not regularly screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria after three months posttransplant, since treatment beyond this time has not been shown to be effective in preventing symptomatic UTI, bloodstream infection, or allograft rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infection-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and can lead to unnecessary antibiotic administration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9833003\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UTIs are associated with significant morbidity among transplant recipients, especially if they occur early after transplantation. To prevent UTIs, we administer prophylactic antibiotics. A meta-analysis of six randomized trials in 545 kidney transplant recipients demonstrated that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis was associated with a reduced risk of sepsis and bloodstream infection (relative risk [RR] 0.13, 95% CI 0.02-0.7) and bacteruria (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.31-0.56) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infection-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Prophylaxis did not reduce graft loss or mortality.</p><p>The optimal prophylactic antibiotic regimen is not known with certainty. Based on the meta-analysis cited above, we administer one double-strength tablet of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (160 mg of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a> component) orally daily. Concerns have been raised that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis has become less effective as uropathogens have become more resistant to this regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infection-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/1,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11</a>]. There is no consensus among transplant clinicians regarding the optimal preventive strategy for UTI in the era of increasing antibiotic resistance.</p><p>The optimal duration of prophylaxis is unknown. Most transplant centers continue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> for at least six months to one year posttransplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infection-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. We generally continue trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis indefinitely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infection-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole also prevents opportunistic infections, such as <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia.</p><p>For patients who are reported to be allergic to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>, we carefully assess reported adverse events to determine if patients are truly allergic and offer desensitization to those with true allergies. We provide <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cephalexin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cephalexin</a> 500 mg orally twice daily for three months for the few who are unable to take trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infection-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The decision of the most appropriate alternative agent to use for UTI prophylaxis (ie, when trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole cannot be used) will depend on the patient&rsquo;s current and past microbiology data and on resistance patterns at the transplant center.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12584925\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UTI can present as either uncomplicated UTI or complicated UTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infection-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/3,4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,7</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Uncomplicated UTI -</strong> Patients with uncomplicated UTI present with dysuria, frequency, urgency, hematuria, and suprapubic pain.

Ultrasonography of the urinary system is a reasonable first step, given its ease and lack of side effects. Patients who have autosomal dominant polycystic disease (ADPKD) may require additional imaging if an infected cyst involving the native kidney is suspected. Suspected infection of kidney cysts in patients with polycystic kidney disease should be further investigated using computed tomography (CT)-positron emission tomography (PET) scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infection-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/9,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,20</a>].

Although the absence of contrast reduces the sensitivity of the CT scan, we avoid contrast to prevent nephrotoxicity. These imaging studies can identify urinary tract strictures, stones, and complex cysts. If the CT is also unrevealing, voiding cystourethrography can be performed to identify vesicoureteral reflux. Urodynamic studies can also be performed to identify bladder dysfunction or outflow tract obstruction. Rarely, cystoscopy may be required to detect abnormalities in the urethra or bladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infection-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175069283\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major differential diagnosis among patients who present with complicated UTI is acute allograft rejection. Fever and allograft tenderness are suggestive of UTI, whereas increased serum creatinine in the presence of new or worsening proteinuria and hypertension suggest acute rejection. Among patients who have characteristics of acute rejection, we generally perform a kidney biopsy for a definitive diagnosis.

One study that included patients with asymptomatic <em>E. coli</em> and <em>Enterococcus </em>bacteriuria who presented more than one month posttransplant suggested that the presence of pyuria may be used to identify patients most likely to benefit from antibiotic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infection-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Compared with patients with bacteriuria but no pyuria, patients with bacteriuria and pyuria were more likely to clear bacteriuria with antibiotic administration.</p><p>For all patients who present with asymptomatic bacteriuria who are selected for treatment, we recommend determining the identity and antibiotic susceptibilities of the causative organism before commencing treatment. We recommend the selection of an oral antibiotic based upon the susceptibility pattern of the micro-organism. The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment is not known. We generally administer antibiotics for five days.

Commonly prescribed treatment regimens include monotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a> 4.5 g IV every six hours or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a> 1 g IV every eight hours, or combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV every 12 hours plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a> 1 g IV every eight hours. Antibiotic dosing must be adjusted according to kidney function.</p><p>The optimal duration of treatment is not known.

Oral agents may be substituted for IV therapy once the patient is free of symptoms and antibiotic susceptibilities are known. However, if the causative pathogen is susceptible to a fluoroquinolone (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>), then it is reasonable to switch from IV to oral therapy once the patient is able to take oral medications since fluoroquinolones are highly bioavailable and achieve high concentrations in the urinary tract.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3560527\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent UTI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no studies that have determined the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for recurrent UTI (three or more episodes of UTI in one year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infection-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The duration of therapy for complicated UTI in kidney transplant recipients is typically 14 to 21 days, but, in some situations, a longer course may be necessary. As an example, recurrent UTIs associated with an indwelling source (such as infected cysts in native kidneys) can require up to four to six weeks of therapy. In other situations, therapy for recurrent UTIs can be discontinued after a shorter period, and the patient can be transitioned to prophylactic antibiotics.</p><p>Patients with recurrent UTI should be assessed for anatomic or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract.

We give one double-strength tablet of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (160 mg of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a> component) orally daily. While most transplant centers continue trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for at least six months to one year posttransplant, we generally continue prophylaxis indefinitely. (See <a href=\"#H9833003\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who present with signs or symptoms of UTI should undergo testing with a urine dipstick, urine microscopy, and urine and blood cultures. Selected patients require imaging to exclude potentially correctable structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract. We initially perform an ultrasound of the renal allograft, native kidney, and bladder for patients who are within one month of transplantation, have a history of nephrolithiasis, or have had three or more UTIs within the same year. (See <a href=\"#H12584933\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9832825\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation after diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For transplant recipients who present with asymptomatic bacteriuria within three months of transplantation, we recommend treatment with an oral antibiotic (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We generally use an oral antibiotic based upon the susceptibility pattern of the micro-organism, and we treat for five days.

The selection is based on local antibiotic resistance patterns and the patient&rsquo;s past causative organisms and antibiotic experience. Definitive treatment is tailored to the causative organism. We tailor the duration of treatment according to the time since transplant. (See <a href=\"#H3560483\" class=\"local\">'Uncomplicated UTI'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with complicated UTI, we suggest empiric therapy with intravenous (IV) antibiotics that cover both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Definitive treatment should be administered once the causative organism and susceptibility pattern are known. We treat complicated UTI with 14 to 21 days of antibiotic therapy.
