Potential ARDS-specific pharmacotherapies are being evaluated, although none are currently recommended as routine therapy because patient-important effects are uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Few trials have rigorously examined strategies to prevent ARDS. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> has no proven benefit and trials of inhaled glucocorticoids and beta-2 agonist combinations are awaited. (See <a href=\"#H3540992946\" class=\"local\">'Therapies for prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite preclinical studies that are encouraging, the benefits of agents that enhance lung repair (eg, granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor, stem cell therapy), and agents that reduce inflammation (eg, macrolide antibiotics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>) remain uncertain and require further study before they can be recommended for routine administration in patients with ARDS. (See <a href=\"#H453071072\" class=\"local\">'Therapies for treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults#H1087880222\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults&quot;, section on 'Glucocorticoids'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of potential therapies were once regarded as promising in patients with ARDS, but have since proven to be either ineffective or harmful.
