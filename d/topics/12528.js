As more research is completed with large cohorts that permit subgroup analyses and with longitudinal follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychosocial-issues-in-the-adult-cancer-survivor/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], there is an increasing recognition that psychological issues are primary concerns for cancer survivors posttreatment, although the magnitude of difference between survivors and healthy controls is not clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychosocial-issues-in-the-adult-cancer-survivor/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. For example, cohort studies show that compared with subjects with no histories of cancer, cancer survivors report higher rates of anxiety consistently; while some show higher rates of depression, this has not been consistently demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychosocial-issues-in-the-adult-cancer-survivor/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. </p><p>Other psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence are specific to cancer survivors, and population norms are not relevant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychosocial-issues-in-the-adult-cancer-survivor/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A population-based health registry cohort study from Sweden demonstrates convincingly that mental health diagnoses and psychiatric medications prescribed for cancer survivors are elevated compared with the general population from a year before cancer diagnosis until 10 years after diagnosis for all diseases except non-melanoma skin cancers, although rates do decline after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychosocial-issues-in-the-adult-cancer-survivor/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>It is important to address these psychosocial issues not only to maintain quality of life, but also because these symptoms may impair health screening behaviors that are critical for survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychosocial-issues-in-the-adult-cancer-survivor/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In addition, survivors who have clinical depression have a twofold risk of all-cause mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychosocial-issues-in-the-adult-cancer-survivor/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Unfortunately, data suggest that we are not meeting these needs in cancer survivors as well as we should. For example, in a survey of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) survivors, 50 percent of those who reported feeling distressed said they had not received any treatment for their emotional needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychosocial-issues-in-the-adult-cancer-survivor/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>This section reviews psychosocial issues in cancer survivors, which increasingly are recognized as extending beyond anxiety and depression. Although the term &quot;cancer survivor&quot; may refer to anyone alive after a cancer diagnosis, in this section, we address psychosocial issues in disease-free survivors who have completed treatment. </p><p>Other aspects of general survivorship care are discussed elsewhere in the program.

Increased FOR occurs commonly in the days or weeks prior to regular surveillance visits, when survivors may experience more intrusive thoughts about cancer, irritability, and anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychosocial-issues-in-the-adult-cancer-survivor/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Of importance, it is not clear that FOR is distinct in its qualities from general tendencies to worry about health after cancer or how it is distinct from or related to post-traumatic stress symptoms, which also may include intrusive thoughts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychosocial-issues-in-the-adult-cancer-survivor/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Almost 80 percent of respondents to a national survey of cancer survivors reported some level of FOR as a concern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychosocial-issues-in-the-adult-cancer-survivor/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

image, desire, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction. A diagnosis of cancer and its subsequent treatment often have an impact on some aspect of sexual health in a significant proportion of cancer survivors. As an example, in the 2010 LIVESTRONG survey of over 3000 cancer survivors (63 and 37 percent were female and male survivors, respectively), 66 percent of survivors reported sexual functioning impairment as a physical concern, and 30 percent had sought care for this [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychosocial-issues-in-the-adult-cancer-survivor/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].

For example, it is often difficult to isolate the etiology of symptoms as specifically related to cancer versus from patient-specific factors (eg, older age), medical comorbidities (eg, hypertension, diabetes, or medications), and premorbid sexual function (eg, a reduced frequency of sexual activity prior to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer). While the hormone deficiencies that may result from cancer treatment play a large role in the incidence of sexual concerns following treatment, they are not necessarily the only factors that predict the incidence or severity of sexual dysfunction.

Those tested with survivors posttreatment either focus on physical activity or often have small sample sizes. Rarely has efficacy been established in multi-center, randomized control trials (RCTs) or replication studies.

Many survivors&rsquo; symptoms are in the mild to moderate range for depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress (PTS), or cognitive dysfunction. As a result, psychoeducational interventions that normalize experience, provide adaptive coping strategies, relieve worry, and include the opportunity for emotional expression may be sufficient to manage symptoms for a majority of survivors. </p><p>Psychoeducational and mindfulness-based treatments have also been utilized to address the sexual side effects of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychosocial-issues-in-the-adult-cancer-survivor/abstract/147,148\" class=\"abstract_t\">147,148</a>].

However, despite clear evidence of success in improving sexuality outcomes for survivors, many barriers remain on the part of both patients and health care providers in accessing sexuality resources. </p><p>Helping people find the benefits in their cancer experience could be enough to promote their psychosocial health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychosocial-issues-in-the-adult-cancer-survivor/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One group developed a workbook to reduce distress in breast cancer survivors, which was tested in 49 women with stage 0 to II breast cancer as part of a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychosocial-issues-in-the-adult-cancer-survivor/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>].

There were no differences between the groups on the endpoints of distress and depression, and both groups improved over time. However, those receiving the telephone counseling sessions had significant impacts, specifically in the areas of sexual dysfunction and personal growth.

Individuals were randomly assigned to the intervention or an active control that included relaxation training. Both interventions were delivered by oncology-experienced and trained therapists in manualized, five 60- to 90-minute individual face-to-face sessions over 10 weeks.

(See <a href=\"#H24223414\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 18 to 20 percent of long-term cancer survivors report anxiety, which may present with a complex mixture of physical and psychological symptoms. This can make the recognition of anxiety symptoms by clinicians quite challenging. (See <a href=\"#H24223435\" class=\"local\">'Anxiety'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased fear of recurrence (FOR) occurs commonly in the days or weeks prior to regular surveillance visits, when survivors may experience more intrusive thoughts about cancer, irritability, and anxiety. While no demographics predict the emotional aspects of FOR, race appears to predict the cognitive aspects of FOR, such that non-white survivors perceive that they have a lower likelihood of recurrence and less reported fear than is perceived by white survivors. (See <a href=\"#H962603201\" class=\"local\">'Fear of recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-traumatic stress (PTS) is underdiagnosed in cancer survivors. In part, this reflects the tendency of many with PTS symptoms to use avoidant coping, which serves to reduce anxiety and evidence of symptoms, as well as the recognition that symptoms may not reach the level of a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). While PTS symptoms often do not rise to the level of a disorder in survivors, they may still disrupt quality of life and functioning. (See <a href=\"#H962603225\" class=\"local\">'Post-traumatic stress'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer-related distress differs from anxiety because it is based on the consequences of living with heightened awareness of the uncertainties in life and does not generalize to anxiety in all aspects of life. It is more common in survivors than other psychological issues. (See <a href=\"#H24223485\" class=\"local\">'Cancer-related distress'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression is less of an issue in cancer survivors compared with anxiety, but its presence is detrimental to quality of life and is associated with a twofold increased risk for all-cause mortality in cancer survivors. (See <a href=\"#H962603816\" class=\"local\">'Depression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual health is a multidimensional construct that goes beyond intercourse to include intimacy, body image, desire, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction. A diagnosis of cancer and its subsequent treatment often have an impact on some aspect of sexual health in a significant proportion of cancer survivors. (See <a href=\"#H24223596\" class=\"local\">'Sexual dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While male and female cancer survivors may become infertile after cancer treatment, they may continue to desire to become parents of their own biologic children. It should be recognized that the psychosocial impacts of infertility can be significant, particularly for those survivors without children. (See <a href=\"#H1142462205\" class=\"local\">'Fertility and reproduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer and its treatment can have a broad reach into the lives of cancer survivors and their caregivers, and their social network (eg, friends, community, church). These include issues related to employment and issues specific to their families. (See <a href=\"#H24223620\" class=\"local\">'Social issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine screening of cancer-related distress, including clinical anxiety or depression and PTS, should be carried out as part of the standard follow-up of survivors at least annually. (See <a href=\"#H962605668\" class=\"local\">'Assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a growing body of literature on interventions for patients who experience psychosocial issues related to cancer and its treatment. Recognition of symptoms and prompt referral for therapy are essential. (See <a href=\"#H24223668\" class=\"local\">'Interventions for psychosocial issues'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychosocial-issues-in-the-adult-cancer-survivor/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Miller KD, Siegel RL, Lin CC, et al.
