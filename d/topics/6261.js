The incidence of burns in low- and middle-income countries is 1.3 per 100,000 population compared with an incidence of 0.14 per 100,000 population in high-income countries. Data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database in 2010 show that the incidence of burns requiring medical treatment is 671 per 100,000 in males and 853 per 100,000 in females, of which only 3.4 percent required inpatient hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Predictors of the need for hospitalization for the treatment of burn injuries in Tabriz, Iran, were age under 20 years, female gender, and occupational burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A population-based survey of over 170,000 households representing nearly 350,000 children and 470,000 adults during 2003 in Bangladesh showed that the overall incidence of nonfatal burn injuries was 166 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>An estimate of the frequency with which children are hospitalized throughout the world for treatment of burns is a rate of 8 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In a rural community survey in Ethiopia, burns were the second most common injury to children under 15 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Burns were therefore the leading cause of admission for injury to pediatric hospitals and ranked third as a source of outpatient visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Approximately 173,000 Bangladeshi children suffered moderate-to-severe burns each year, which is an annual rate of 288 burns per 100,000 children. 90 percent of the burns occurred at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/23,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,28,29</a>].

Burns are more common in low- and middle-income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The three regions with the highest prevalence rates are the Western Pacific Region, Eastern Mediterranean Region, and Southeast Asia Region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Region for region, low-income countries have a greater burden of fire-related burns than high-income countries. A community-based household survey in Baghdad from 2003 through 2014 showed that the prevalence of burns was 1.1 percent of the 5148 individuals interviewed from 900 households [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

In higher-income countries, 37 percent of deliberate self-burnings were associated with mental illness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> substance abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In lower-income countries, the data are difficult to discern. A review of 55 studies of deliberate self-burnings found that the most common motivations for self-harm were psychiatric illnesses (Western and Middle East regions), personal (India, Sri Lanka, Papua New Guinea, and Zimbabwe), and political (India and South Korea) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Assault, usually by a spouse, is most often caused by throwing caustic chemicals or flammable liquids at the victim's face or genitalia, or ignition of clothing (eg, dowry deaths in India) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p>In the United States (US) and Europe, deliberate self-burnings account for less than 1 percent of suicide attempts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/39,42,45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,42,45-47</a>]. A retrospective review of 7139 burn patients between 1979 and 1998 in a US burn center found that 184 (2.6 percent) were self-inflicted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Self-immolation with an accelerant (53.3 percent) and ignition of clothing without an accelerant (20.1 percent) were the most common methods used. By comparison, in Nepal, nearly 30 percent of burn admissions are for intentional injuries, of which 90 percent are self-inflicted and only 10 percent are assaults. Mortality rates in this series were three times higher for intentional compared with unintentional burns. Patients with intentional burns were more likely to be married women between the ages of 25 and 30 years; fire burns at home using kerosene as accelerant were the most common mechanism of intentional burn injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In locations with seasonal variations of temperature, burns occur more frequently in the colder winter months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/1,13,18,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13,18,50,51</a>]. Burns also occur more commonly when meals are prepared, particularly in lower-income countries where there is exposure to open flames and nonelectric appliances used for cooking, heating, and lighting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/2,52-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,52-58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Flames and scalds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flame injuries and scalds are the most common causes of burns in children and adults worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/19,35,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,35,59,60</a>]. Based on information collected from US burn centers between 1995 and 2005, 46 percent of burns resulted from <span class=\"nowrap\">flame/fire</span> and 32 percent from scalds from hot liquids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/43,61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,61,62</a>]. A retrospective review of 127,016 hospitalized burn patients between 1999 and 2008 from 79 US hospitals found that the most frequent known causes of burns were <span class=\"nowrap\">fire/flame</span> (42 percent), scald (30 percent), contact with hot object (9 percent), electrical (4 percent), chemical (3 percent), and other (12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>In many households in low- and middle-income countries, especially in rural areas lacking electrification, open flames are common, including floors of huts with open hearths used for cooking and warmth, candles, and small kerosene and naphtha stoves and lanterns. The fire risk from these sources is increased by lack of enclosure for open fires, floor-level location of fires and stoves, instability of appliances, nearby storage of volatile and flammable fuels, flammable clothing and housing materials, and lack of exits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/2,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,53</a>]. Serious injuries from kerosene stoves have been documented in Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, and other low- and middle-income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/40,52,54-58,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,52,54-58,63</a>]. As more households in resource-limited settings move away from kerosene as a fuel source for domestic stoves and heaters, there has been a subsequent increase in the number of injuries sustained from the use of natural gas and propane. In the decade 2005 to 2014 in Ecuador, domestic methane gas was the most frequent agent causing thermal burns in patients admitted to the specialized public hospital in Quito [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Retrospective analysis of deaths in the Lucknow Region of India show that nearly 11 percent of all deaths are due to burns; 60 percent of these were flame burns. Nearly 90 percent of burn deaths occur in women, and nearly 40 percent of burn deaths are self-inflicted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. In Nepal, most unintentional burns hospitalized at a tertiary care center were flame burns at home in women engaged in cooking; kerosene and biomass were the most common fuels used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A systematic review of unintentional burn injuries in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka from 1970 to 2011 confirmed that most serious burns occurred in older girls (&gt;14 years) and women in the home, with risk factors including low socioeconomic status; being younger; wearing loose, flammable clothing; and the use of kerosene for cooking fuel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. </p><p>Scald burns occur from hot tap water baths, hot foods and liquids, and heated cooking oils. <span class=\"nowrap\">Flame/fire-related</span> injuries overall are the most frequent reason for admissions to US burn centers.
