In the 1957 and 1968 pandemics, the new viruses contained components of previous human as well as avian influenza viruses. The origin of the influenza virus responsible for the 1918 pandemic, which killed more people in a single year than the bubonic plague, remains uncertain, but it appears to have been an adapted avian influenza strain. The emergence of a novel H1N1 human-swine-avian reassortant virus in 2009 in North America started a new pandemic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of pandemic H1N1 influenza ('swine influenza')&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sporadic transmission of avian influenza H5N1 to more than 850 humans since 2003 has prompted concerns that conditions are suitable for emergence of a pandemic strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Two features of avian influenza H5N1 outbreaks are striking: the predominance of children and young adults; and the high mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. However, seroprevalence studies have found that some exposed individuals may have had a subclinical or mild infection, suggesting that the reported case-fatality rate may be an overestimate.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of avian influenza will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of avian influenza are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with H5N1 avian influenza infection give a history of recent exposure to dead or ill poultry. Thus, a comprehensive travel and epidemiologic history is critical in the identification of suspected cases. Patients who meet clinical and epidemiologic criteria should be tested for H5N1 avian influenza infection. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Who should be tested'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of H5N1 avian influenza can be established by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or viral culture of respiratory specimens. RT-PCR under biosafety level 2 conditions is the preferred diagnostic method, and virus culture should be performed only under biosafety level 3 conditions. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serologic testing is a useful tool for epidemiologic surveillance studies and retrospective diagnosis, but is not helpful in the acute setting.
