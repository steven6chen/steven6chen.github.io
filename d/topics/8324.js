They represent the guidelines endorsed by the American College of Surgeons and the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, and follow the criteria established for a US bariatric COE. We advise that hospitals that perform bariatric surgery be accredited, as at this time, accreditation is the best approach to ensure adherence to these criteria, which are associated with improved patient outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H8836874\" class=\"local\">'Criteria for accreditation'</a> below.)</p><p>A 2016 systematic review identified 13 studies that examined the impact of bariatric accreditation on surgical outcomes in over 1.5 million patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-accreditation-accommodations-and-staffing-for-care-of-the-bariatric-surgical-patient/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Overall, 10 of 13 studies reported benefit associated with achieving COE accreditation. A mortality benefit for COEs over nonaccredited facilities was reported by six of eight studies, with odds ratios ranging from 2.26 to 3.57. Similarly, morbidity benefit was reported by 8 of 11 studies, with odds ratios ranging from 1.09 to 1.39.</p><p>In 2006, prompted by concern regarding perioperative safety, the US Centers for Medicaid &amp; Medicare Services (CMS) had restricted coverage of bariatric surgery to hospitals designated as centers of excellence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-accreditation-accommodations-and-staffing-for-care-of-the-bariatric-surgical-patient/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. These criteria were scrutinized in a retrospective, longitudinal study that included outcome data on Medicare patients undergoing bariatric surgical procedures before (n = 6723) and after (n = 15,854) implementation of the policy and found no significant differences for any complication (8.0 versus 7.0 percent), serious complication (3.3 versus 3.6 percent), or reoperation (1.0 versus 1.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-accreditation-accommodations-and-staffing-for-care-of-the-bariatric-surgical-patient/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, hospitals designated as COEs (n = 179) had similar outcome data as hospitals without COE accreditation (n = 519), including rates of serious complications (2.2 versus 2.5 percent, respectively). Hence, in light of equivalent complication rates, CMS has decided not to require COE accreditation for hospitals that perform bariatric surgery for Medicare patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-accreditation-accommodations-and-staffing-for-care-of-the-bariatric-surgical-patient/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This decision was made, at least in part, to ensure that Medicare patients would not have limited access to bariatric surgical care.</p><p>The CMS decision has been evaluated and strongly criticized by several surgical societies that include the American College of Surgeons, the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgeons, the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons, the Obesity Society, and the American Society of Bariatric Physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-accreditation-accommodations-and-staffing-for-care-of-the-bariatric-surgical-patient/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The criticism of the Societies is based upon the consensus that CMS used flawed data to arrive at its conclusions. The rationale for not accepting the CMS new course of action includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Outcomes </strong>&mdash; The outcomes data referenced by the CMS did not compare the potentially sicker population of Medicare patients who typically are older and have multiple comorbid illnesses. In addition, a cohort study using nationwide Medicare data (n = 47,030) comparing pre-COE and post-COE designation requirements for 90-day outcomes found a 50 percent reduction in mortality, 25 percent reduction in readmission rate, 20 percent reduction in costs, and a 33 percent reduction in reoperation rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-accreditation-accommodations-and-staffing-for-care-of-the-bariatric-surgical-patient/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. While some of the improvements may be secondary to the change in procedures performed pre- and post-COE designation requirement, such as the introduction of the laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding procedure to the open and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedures in the post-era, the post-COE designation cohort was comprised of more patients over age 65 years with more comorbidities. Other studies also suggest that accredited centers continue to have better outcomes and lower mortality rates than do nonaccredited centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-accreditation-accommodations-and-staffing-for-care-of-the-bariatric-surgical-patient/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric procedures for the management of severe obesity: Descriptions&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Volume </strong>&mdash; Volume alone does not improve outcomes, as high volume accredited centers report a lower mortality rate compared with low volume centers as well as high volume nonaccredited hospitals. In a retrospective review of 277,760 laparoscopic stapling bariatric surgical procedures performed between 2006 and 2010, the in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in low volume centers (&lt;50 stapling <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/year)</span> compared with high volume centers (0.17 versus 0.07 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-accreditation-accommodations-and-staffing-for-care-of-the-bariatric-surgical-patient/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, the in-hospital mortality rate was significantly lower in the accredited high volume centers compared with nonaccredited high volume centers (0.06 versus 0.22 percent). The mortality rates between nonaccredited high volume centers and low volume centers was equivalent; hence, the impact of accreditation may be more substantial than volume alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Access </strong>&mdash; The concern that accreditation would limit access to bariatric surgical care is unfounded. There is no documented evidence that Medicare patients are denied access to accredited centers. Since the initial requirement for COE hospital accreditation, the number of procedures for Medicare beneficiaries has increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-accreditation-accommodations-and-staffing-for-care-of-the-bariatric-surgical-patient/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>]. The literature does not support the notion that COE accreditation limits access for patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-accreditation-accommodations-and-staffing-for-care-of-the-bariatric-surgical-patient/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Safety</strong> &mdash; A major benefit of the hospital COE designation requirement is the ability to collect and analyze data to improve patient safety and outcomes on a national level. Without the COE designation, access to data on this large scale would be extremely difficult. In addition, at this time it is unclear how the private payers (private insurers) will proceed or how access to accredited or nonaccredited centers will be affected with the US Affordable Care Act (ACA). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Access to health care is anticipated to expand in the US because of the ACA, and hence, the number of bariatric procedures performed is most likely to increase. The patient safety concern is that bariatric operations performed at nonaccredited hospitals will continue to have higher mortality rates, independent of volume, as well as higher reoperation rates and higher costs. In addition, Medicare and privately insured patients may not have access to allied health care professionals who provide nutritional, lifestyle, and psychologic counseling and postoperative follow-up that are standard of care in accredited centers. (See <a href=\"#H22371133\" class=\"local\">'The role of allied health care personnel'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Following the best practices outlined by the American College of Surgeons and the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery is more important than the official designation as an accredited center of excellence (COE). If there is an institutional commitment to these practices, then, most likely, outcomes will be equivalent to those of the accredited hospitals. However, the accreditation process is the best approach to determine if an individual hospital adheres to the best practice guidelines; it is also the best approach for monitoring individual institutional performance and patient outcomes with the added benefit of comparison to national standards and outcome data.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8836874\"><span class=\"h1\">CRITERIA FOR ACCREDITATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8836941\"><span class=\"h2\">Bariatric centers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American College of Surgeons and the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgeons have combined their recommendations and criteria for bariatric Centers of Excellence into the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Project (MBS-AQIP) in order to provide a single resource of the best practices for obesity care for providers and hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-accreditation-accommodations-and-staffing-for-care-of-the-bariatric-surgical-patient/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

RDs should work with the hospital food service department to develop post bariatric surgery meals that are high in protein, low in carbohydrates and fat in the appropriate portion sizes, ensuring that if a &ldquo;regular&rdquo; diet is ordered for a post Roux-en-y gastric bypass patient, a proper diet is delivered. Bariatric specific diets can be especially helpful in the immediate postoperative period when the recommendations are for clear liquids and full liquids, ensuring that the meals are augmented with protein drinks to ensure adequate protein intake. RDs can help prepare bariatric patients for the postoperative diet changes by educating patients in portion control and maintenance of adequate nutrition. Without such education, patients tend to eat more fat and calories than they realize. Specifics of diet information and supplementation after bariatric surgical procedures is detailed in the tables and discussed in detail elsewhere (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50516\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50516 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62266\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62266 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80913\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80913 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F114101\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114101 \">table 5</a>).

This is usually a consequence of poor eating habits. In addition, patients do not always understand the need for careful, long-term follow up and may not be taking vitamins or may be taking the wrong doses or types of nutrient and vitamin supplementation for the type of bariatric surgical procedure they underwent.
