They are cysts of epithelial remnants of the thyroglossal tract and present characteristically as a midline neck mass at the level of the thyrohyoid membrane, closely associated with the hyoid bone. Although most patients with TGDCs are children or adolescents, up to one-third are aged 20 years or older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Males and females are equally affected.</p><p>Patients with a TGDC often have ectopic thyroid glands. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Thyroid ectopia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EMBRYOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anlage of the thyroid gland forms at the foramen cecum of the tongue, which is located on the dorsum of the tongue posteriorly at the apex of the V-shaped sulcus formed by the circumvallate papillae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. During the fourth week of gestation, a ventral diverticulum of the foramen cecum is formed from the first and second pharyngeal pouches (the medial thyroid anlage). This diverticulum, with its narrow neck connected to the tongue, descends in the midline of the neck as the thyroglossal tract to the position of the normal thyroid in the base of the neck, where the thyroid lobes separate, by the seventh week. The path of descent is usually anterior to the hyoid bone but may be posterior to or through the bone and ends on the anterior surface of the first few tracheal rings.</p><p>The tract usually atrophies and disappears by the tenth week of gestation. Portions of the tract and remnants of thyroid tissue associated with it may persist at any point between the tongue and the thyroid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F79472\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79472 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The pyramidal lobe can be thought of as the most caudal remnant of this tract and is present in approximately one-third of normal subjects. The lateral thyroid anlage, consisting of the C-cell precursors, which arises from the neural crest portion of the fourth pharyngeal pouch, ultimately fuses with the descended medial anlage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The pyramidal lobe usually arises from the isthmus of the thyroid but may arise from the medial aspect of one of the thyroid lobes or both lobes.</p><p>A thyroglossal duct cyst arises as a cystic expansion of a remnant of the thyroglossal duct tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The stimulus for the expansion is not known; one postulate is that lymphoid tissue associated with the tract hypertrophies at the time of a regional infection, thereby occluding the tract with resultant cyst formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Many cystic remnants of the thyroglossal tract are never detected clinically; a postmortem study of 200 adults found a 7 percent incidence of thyroglossal duct cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a TGDC usually present with a midline upper neck mass that is cystic. The mass usually causes no symptoms but may be slightly tender. Often the patient has or recently had an upper respiratory tract infection, but whether the infection leads to cyst formation or simply increases the likelihood of detection of a preexisting cyst is uncertain. </p><p>The cyst may occur anywhere along the thyroglossal duct tract from the foramen cecum at the base of the tongue to the level of the suprasternal notch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F79472\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79472 \">figure 1</a>). In most cases, the cyst is at or just below the hyoid bone adjacent to the thyrohyoid membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Cysts below the thyrohyoid membrane are rare. There are only two reported cases, one reaching to the suprasternal notch and the second encroaching into the superior mediastinum, descending all the way to the aortic arch. A TGDC in such a location can masquerade as a thymic mass and cause confusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>TGDCs are usually within 2 cm of the midline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] but can be somewhat more lateral and may even be lateral to the thyroid cartilage (more typically on the left). The typical cyst does, however, maintain a close relationship to the hyoid, thyrohyoid membrane, or thyroid cartilage. Classically, TGDCs move up with swallowing or protrusion of the tongue, emphasizing their close relationship with the <span class=\"nowrap\">hyoid/larynx</span> complex.</p><p>The typical close relationship between a TGDC and the thyroid cartilage can result, if the cyst is large, in remodeling of the laryngeal cartilage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, because the cysts do not typically invade, laryngeal reconstruction is rarely required even after excision of large cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Familial occurrence of TGDCs has been reported but is extremely rare, with 21 individuals of hereditary TGDCs in seven families reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The most common inheritance pattern appears to be autosomal dominant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In addition, radiation therapy used to treat head and neck cancers can acutely enlarge subclinical thyroglossal duct remnants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Very rarely, a TGDC may present in an ectopic location (eg, an endolaryngeal cyst). In such cases, an open procedure is preferred over an endoscopic surgical approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. An intrathyroidal cyst with thyroglossal duct cyst-like lining has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">THYROID ECTOPIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid ectopia is defined as functioning thyroid tissue found anywhere other than the usual anatomic location of thyroid gland. Ectopic thyroid is usually located along the normal path of thyroid gland descent but rarely can also be found in mediastinum, heart, esophagus, or diaphragm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Ectopic thyroid tissue is derived from abnormalities in migration of the medial anlage and hence typically does not contain C cells.</p><p>Failure of thyroid gland descent occurs in approximately 1 in 200,000 normal subjects and 1 in 6000 patients with thyroid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The true incidence of thyroid ectopia is not known due to the asymptomatic nature of some ectopic thyroid tissue.</p><p>The most common site of ectopic thyroid is a lingual thyroid. The wall of a TGDC is the second most common site for ectopic thyroid tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The ectopic tissue is usually found in the form of small groups of follicles and is present in 25 to 65 percent of cysts examined histologically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Up to 1 to 2 percent of patients presenting with what appears to be a TGDC have an ectopic thyroid gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Association with hypothyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of thyroid ectopia manifest as simple TGDCs in conjunction with a normally developed and located thyroid gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Some thyroid ectopia function normally, but approximately one-third of patients present with hypothyroidism.</p><p>If hypothyroidism develops, the mass may enlarge as a result of stimulation by thyrotropin (TSH). Ectopic thyroid tissue may enlarge during puberty or pregnancy. Treatment with thyroid hormone supplementation is usually sufficient for suppression, but surgical excision may become necessary.</p><p>The preoperative detection of hypothyroidism in a patient with a midline neck mass increases the suspicion of ectopic thyroid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. On a rare occasion, thyroglossal ductal ectopy is found in patients diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism associated with thyroid ectopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

If the descent is completely arrested at the level of the base of tongue, a lingual thyroid results. Partial descent can result in an ectopic gland in a sublingual or prelaryngeal position. Excessive migration can result in a substernal ectopic gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/16,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,22,23</a>].</p><p>Among ectopic thyroid glands, 90 percent are lingual and 10 percent occur in other sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In patients presenting with a lingual thyroid, over 70 percent have no thyroid tissue in the normal location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A lingual thyroid can represent the only functioning thyroid tissue, so excision could lead to severe hypothyroidism, requiring thyroid hormone replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Enlargement of lingual thyroid tissue can be seen with upper respiratory infections (due to associated lymphoid tissue), during pregnancy, or at puberty, leading to regional symptoms such as dysphagia, dysphonia, dyspnea, or hemoptysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/16,22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,22,25</a>].</p><p>Carcinoma arising in a lingual thyroid is rare, with fewer than 30 cases reported in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

A patient who has a substantial amount of thyroid tissue within a lymph node in the lateral neck should be suspected to have a nodal metastasis of a small well-differentiated carcinoma of the thyroid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p>True embryologic rests of normal thyroid tissue (believed to form as a result of migration error) have been described in several locations, including adjacent to the larynx, aortic arch, and heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] as well as within lymph nodes in the lateral neck. Strict criteria must be followed in order to exclude foci of well-differentiated thyroid cancer within the node. Such nodal embryologic rests must be small, containing only a few thyroid follicles and with none of the nuclear features of papillary carcinoma, and should be present only in the capsular region of the node [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/3,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Exophytic and paracytic nodules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid tissue that is not within a lymph node can occur in the lateral neck or upper mediastinum through progression of thyroid nodular disease on the surface of the gland.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exophytic nodules are surface nodules that progressively enlarge and become detached from the main portion of the thyroid gland.

Radionuclide imaging, ultrasonography, and computed tomography (CT) are undoubtedly more reliable tests to identify the presence of thyroid tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical utility of ultrasonography in thyroid disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19294504\"><span class=\"h2\">CT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a suspected case of thyroglossal duct cyst, CT of the neck with contrast is the most preferred imaging modality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F82790\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82790 \">image 1</a>). Typically, CT imaging depicts thyroglossal duct cysts as well-circumscribed lesions with homogenous fluid attenuation surrounded by a thin enhancing rim [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. It not only helps to confirm the diagnosis of thyroglossal duct cyst by defining the typical close relationship of the cyst to the hyoid bone but also provides information regarding the size, extent, and location. It also identifies normal orthotopic thyroid tissue. Additional wall enhancement indicates an infected TGDC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3432991282\"><span class=\"h2\">MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), water characteristics are seen (ie, dark on T1- and bright on T2-weighted images) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Patients with an incidentally found TGDC should be referred to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation, regular follow-up, and surgery when symptoms arise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CARCINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of primary carcinoma of the thyroglossal duct is less than 1 percent in all age groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Thus, If the cyst is found to contain thyroid cancer, one must be sure that the carcinoma arose from within the cyst and is not a cystic metastasis to a midline lymph node from a primary thyroid cancer (eg, pyramidal lobe papillary thyroid cancer [PTC] or Delphian [prelaryngeal] lymph node PTC metastasis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].

After review of pathology, if a surgeon is certain of the diagnosis of thyroglossal duct cyst carcinoma (ie, primary thyroid gland carcinoma has been ruled out) and thyroid sonography is negative, then surgical treatment of thyroglossal duct cyst is sufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. A thyroidectomy is performed in cases where a primary thyroid malignancy cannot be excluded or when secondary thyroid malignancy is detected. In a retrospective review of a series that included 26 patients with thyroglossal duct cyst cancer, approximately 60 percent also had a differentiated thyroid cancer identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Patients with infected cysts should receive antibiotic therapy and not undergo incision and drainage, because the latter can lead to scarring and make later surgery more difficult. Preoperative fine-needle aspiration can be helpful to decrease cyst size and in some cases may lead to identification of thyroglossal duct cyst carcinoma, if solid elements of the lesion can be sampled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>A new modification of the repeat Sistrunk operation, suture-guided transhyoid pharyngotomy, has also been proposed to allow the surgeon better visibility of normal structures and direct access to the tissues between the hyoid bone and the foramen cecum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. A single series of eight of these procedures, all done successfully by a single surgeon, has been reported.

Carcinoma of the thyroglossal duct is usually diagnosed only after histologic study because there are a few clinical clues to the presence of cancer within a TGDC.
