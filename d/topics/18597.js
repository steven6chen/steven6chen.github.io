VTE has significant morbidity and mortality for patients in the community and in hospital. Anticoagulation is the mainstay of therapy for VTE. The purpose of anticoagulation is the prevention of recurrent thrombosis, embolization, and death, the risk of which is greatest in the first three to six months following the diagnosis.</p><p>Following initial anticoagulation for the first 5 to 10 days, patients with VTE require therapy for a more prolonged period of at least three months. This topic review will discuss the selection of an anticoagulant, the transition from initial therapy, and the duration and monitoring of long-term anticoagulation. The indications for anticoagulation, an overview of DVT treatment, and details regarding initial and indefinite anticoagulation for patients with VTE are discussed separately.

In contrast, a provoked DVT is one that is usually caused by a known event (eg, surgery, hospital admission). VTE events can be provoked by transient major risk factors (ie, major surgery &gt;30 minutes, hospitalization or immobility &ge;3 days, caesarian section), transient minor risk factors (minor surgery &lt;30 minutes, hospitalization &lt;3 days, pregnancy, estrogen therapy, reduced mobility &ge;3 days) or persistent risk factors. Persistent risk factors include reversible conditions (eg, curable malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease that resolves) and irreversible conditions such as inheritable thrombophilias, chronic heart failure, and metastatic end-stage malignancy.

Long-term anticoagulant therapy is administered for a finite time beyond the initial period, usually three to six months, and occasionally up to 12 months (ie, there is a scheduled stop date). Extended anticoagulation refers to therapy that is administered indefinitely (ie, no scheduled stop date).

While the factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors are typically preferred, choosing among these options frequently depends upon clinician experience and availability, the risks of bleeding, patient comorbidities and preferences, cost, and convenience (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F107541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107541 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-thromboembolism-anticoagulation-after-initial-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Patient values and preferences are critical in selecting a long-term agent for anticoagulation in acute venous thromboembolism (VTE). Variations exist in the perceptions of burden by patients. For example, while some patients want to avoid daily injections, others may consider them preferable to weekly international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-thromboembolism-anticoagulation-after-initial-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As another example, patients who place a high value on antidote availability and cost may choose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, while others who place a high value on a lower risk of bleeding may prefer the direct oral anticoagulants.

While rivaroxaban and apixaban can be administered as monotherapy, edoxaban and dabigatran are preferably administered following a five day course of heparin (ie, as dual therapy; LMW or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> [UFH]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Our preference for these agents is based upon their similar efficacy, reduced need for monitoring, and lower bleeding risk profile, when compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>. In addition, theoretically patients may spend more time in the therapeutic range with these agents when compared with warfarin. Clinicians should be aware that although the risk of bleeding is lower with these agents, experience with antidotes is limited. No agent is superior to the other and dosing for each agent is per product information. When prescribing these agents, we prefer that they be administered by clinicians knowledgeable in their use in accordance with study criteria that proved their efficacy.

Similarly, many experts avoid them in those with chronic liver disease in whom the INR may be elevated. For those in whom monitoring compliance and agent reversal is important, avoidance may also be appropriate. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Issues concerning long-term safety, drug-drug interactions, and use of these agents in those with hepatic disease still need to be clarified in future trials. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Warfarin</a> &ndash; Warfarin is our preferred anticoagulant for patients in whom factor Xa or direct thrombin inhibitors are not available and for patients with severe renal insufficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F91199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91199 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Warfarin</a> requires multiple office visits for INR monitoring and has a higher bleeding risk when compared with direct oral anticoagulants; however, antidotes for warfarin-related bleeding are more readily available.

This overlap is required because it takes a number of days for all of the vitamin K-dependent factors to become depleted (factors II, VII, IX, and X). During the first few days of warfarin therapy, prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT; as reflected by the INR) mainly reflects the depression of factor VII, which has a short half-life (hours) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50940\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50940 \">figure 1</a>). Importantly, this does not represent adequate anticoagulation because additional vitamin K-dependent factors are insufficiently reduced (takes approximately five days with adequate dosing). In addition, reduction of protein C and S occurs shortly after warfarin therapy and potentially renders a procoagulant state. Together, these factors increase the likelihood of recurrent thrombosis should patients not be fully anticoagulated with parenteral heparin.

This disparity between clinical practice and published trials may be due to the exclusion from trials of patients that may theoretically benefit from longer courses of anticoagulation (eg, extensive or life-threatening VTE). In addition, the data suggest that the risk of recurrence does continue to decline between three and six months on anticoagulant therapy. For these reasons, guidelines and many experts use a three- to six-month range for an optimal duration of therapy for patients with provoked VTE who are at low risk of bleeding and in whom the risk of recurrence is still assessed by the clinician as high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-thromboembolism-anticoagulation-after-initial-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The optimal duration of therapy for patients with distal DVT and small subsegmental PE is less certain; in general we treat these patients for three months as well. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a provoked episode of VTE who have persistent but reversible risk factors (eg, continued estrogen use, prolonged immobility following trauma), we suggest <strong>extending</strong> <strong>anticoagulation for a finite period</strong> until the risk factor is resolved, rather than stopping anticoagulation at three months (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Select patients benefit from <strong>indefinite</strong> anticoagulation and are discussed separately.

The strategy used depends upon the anticoagulants used for such periods. Interruptions during the first three months should be minimized due to the high risk of recurrent thrombosis during this period.

(See <a href=\"#H28215432\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major bleeding rates on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> and LMW heparin during the first three months of anticoagulant therapy are low (less than 2 percent). Factor Xa and direct thrombin inhibitors have lower bleeding rates compared to warfarin; however, these rates may not reflect those in clinical practice and reversal of the anticoagulant effect is considerably more complex than that for warfarin.
