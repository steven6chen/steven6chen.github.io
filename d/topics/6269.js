This is also true for other children whose families are involved with the child welfare system and children living away from their parents in informal placements with relatives.</p><p>An understanding of the structure, goals, and mandates of the foster care system, as well as the unique health, mental health, developmental, and educational problems of children and adolescents in foster care, facilitates provision of appropriate comprehensive care to this vulnerable population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In particular, health providers need to consider and be able to educate other professionals and caregivers about the impact of early childhood adversity and trauma on emotional, behavioral, and developmental health. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comprehensive health care for children in foster care&quot;, section on 'Complex childhood trauma and toxic stress'</a>.)</p><p>The epidemiology of foster care placement and an overview of the structure, goals, and mandates of the foster care system will be discussed here. The health, mental health, developmental, and educational needs of children in the foster care system are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comprehensive health care for children in foster care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Involvement with child welfare usually begins when a mandated reporter or other citizen makes a report to child protective services for concerns of child abuse or neglect. Of the 4.1 million families reported annually in the United States, approximately 60 percent are investigated for child maltreatment and approximately 20 percent of these families, involving approximately 676,000 children, have allegations of maltreatment founded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Whether or not allegations are founded, most families remain intact and are referred to a variety of preventive services.</p><p>Removal of children occurs when child protective services affirms that the child is at imminent risk of harm if <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> remains in the home. Child welfare has to substantiate the reasons for removal to the court system within 72 hours to keep the child in placement. Annually, approximately 230,000 children are removed from their families and placed in foster care.</p><p>Children who are placed in foster care must be placed in the least restrictive setting that meets their needs, which is usually family foster care. Some communities place children in shelters pending availability of a family. Approximately one-third of children are placed with relative or kin, while the majority are placed in nonrelative foster care. Oversight by the court and case management by child welfare continue until discharge from foster care by the court. </p><p>Children and adolescents who are placed in foster care have usually suffered childhood trauma from a variety of accumulated adverse childhood experiences. Placement in foster care is intended to be a temporary arrangement during which the health and safety of children are protected while the birth parents are provided with services that support reunification with their children.</p><p>Foster care is mandated to seek timely permanency for children in its care, either through reunification with family, placement with relatives, or adoption. If independent living is a realistic goal for an adolescent, foster care is mandated to provide services that nurture the adolescent toward independent adult living.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact numbers of children in foster care are difficult to determine. In the United States, approximately 437,500 resided in foster care on any given day in 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A study using data from the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System and synthetic cohort life tables (2000 through 2011) estimated that approximately 6 percent of children in the United States were placed in foster care at some point between birth and 18 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. During the same time period, annual foster care placement numbers decreased by approximately 25 percent, but child abuse referrals increased and the number of children and adolescents classified as emotionally disturbed almost doubled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although overall numbers of children in foster care declined, the greatest decline was in African-American children (from 17.4 to 9.6 per 1000 children between 2002 and 2012) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Since 2012, anecdotal reports suggest an increase in foster care placements and an increasing number of placements related to parental substance abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>]. There was also a surge in unaccompanied refugee minors in 2014 to 2016, mostly from Mexico and Central America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The number of children in foster care increased between 1981 and 2000, but then decreased for several reasons: an increased reliance on informal kinship placements; a simultaneous increase in adoptions out of foster care; and greater use of alternative resources, or preventive services, to maintain children in their families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/1,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10-12</a>].

Black or African-American children, who account for approximately 15 percent of the general population, are overrepresented in foster care. Despite a relatively larger reduction in the percentage of black or African-American children in care compared with other <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> groups, concern persists that the overrepresentation of black or African-American children in foster care results from bias in decision-making during child protective investigation, with relatively more minority children removed from their families than white non-Hispanic children, despite similar risk factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Length of stay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The average length of stay in foster care is approximately 20 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>]. Data from the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System indicate that 48 percent of children who exited foster care during 2016 spent &lt;12 months in foster care, but 28 percent spent &ge;24 months, and 6 percent spent &ge;5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Children of color, older children, and children with significant behavioral problems or developmental disabilities are twice as likely to remain in foster care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The same factors that predict longer stays in foster care (minority children, older children, children with significant developmental or behavioral problems) also predict more placement changes or greater placement instability. However, placement changes are also affected by child welfare administrative decisions and by child behavior problems. Increased length of stay in foster care is an independent predictor of decreased likelihood of reunification and increased placement instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

The legal and regulatory framework designed to protect children and families and improve their outcomes is challenging to navigate. Courts have oversight, and there are multiple attorneys and advocates representing child welfare, parents, and children in each case. The federal government determines the patterns of funding and regulatory guidelines, whereas state agencies determine the structure and implementation of programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. At the local level, the day-to-day foster care operations can be managed by private foster care agencies or public child welfare agencies, or a combination of public-private partnership.

Child welfare is, however, structured so that caseworkers are mentored and supervised by more senior experienced personnel.</p><p>In addition to the caseworker, children in the foster care system may be appointed a law guardian (also called a &quot;guardian ad litem&quot;). This professional is often an attorney but may be a layperson in some states. The law guardian is designated to be the child's voice in court, although many law guardians may not have met the child before appearing in court on the child's behalf. Occasionally, the court also may appoint a special advocate (court-appointed special advocate, or CASA) who represents the interests of the child in court; the CASA is a trained volunteer, not an attorney.</p><p>The birth parents and the foster care agency also have legal representation in court.</p><p>Court is by design an adversarial process compared with the movement in child welfare toward shared parenting and building relationships between resources and birth parents in the best interests of the child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The site of placement is determined by the child's needs and is supposed to be in the least restrictive environment. The options include foster care homes, kinship care homes, specialized or therapeutic foster homes, and residential or group home facilities. The optimal placement is within a well-supported family where the foster- or kinship-care parents have received training related to child development, behavior, parenting, and the impact of childhood trauma.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foster care home &ndash; Foster parenting is a voluntary program that is heavily dependent upon the good intentions and abilities of altruistic laypeople. Foster parents usually are motivated by love of children, religious conviction, altruism, or personal need [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Most foster parents care for more than one child in foster care; state laws set the maximum number of children in foster homes, depending upon their ages, from four to six [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. An unknown percentage of foster parents choose the foster-to-adopt pathway in hopes of being able to adopt children placed in their home.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Foster parents typically receive limited training and minimal continuing education. Training briefly covers child development, managing behavior problems, discipline, safety, the impact of child abuse and neglect, childhood trauma, and the foster parents' relationship with the foster care agency and birth parents. Caseworkers, who may have no more than some college education, are expected to provide ongoing support and advice but frequently lack expertise about child development, behavior, parenting, and the impact of childhood trauma. The annual recertification required for foster parents is less intense than the initial certification process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While foster parents receive a foster care board subsidy for the care they provide, the amount of reimbursement varies from state to state. Although the board subsidy should be adjusted depending upon the age of the child and the anticipated complexity of care, average basic monthly stipends for children without complex medical needs range widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The stipend is expected to cover the cost of food, shelter, personal needs, recreation, transportation, and education for the child. Some states provide an additional allowance for clothing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The cost of medical care usually is paid by state Medicaid programs. In most states, on average, foster parents subsidize approximately 33 percent of the true cost of caring for a foster child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kinship care &ndash; Kinship care is a term that encompasses relatives who have become certified foster parents as well as relatives and friends who care for children placed with them by the court as a result of child protective investigation but choose not to enroll in the certification process. The largest group of children living with adults who are not their parents reside in informal kinship care, most without ever being involved with child welfare or the courts. Until the passage of Fostering Connections in 2008, states usually did not provide subsidies for kinship families who were not certified foster parents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is estimated that there are approximately four to eight times as many children living in informal kinship care as in foster care, and that kinship caregivers are older, poorer, and have more health problems than the average foster parent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. There has been a substantial increase in the use of kinship homes so that, in some communities, nearly one-half of the foster homes are kinship homes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Overall, placement with a relative occurs in approximately 30 percent of official foster care placements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Placement in kinship care is advantageous in maintaining the child's belonging in the larger family of origin and is less likely to be a disruptive transition since children are likely to have had a pre-existing relationship with the kin caregiver. Kinship placements are also more stable for children over time than foster care placements, and caregivers report fewer behavioral problems than unrelated foster caregivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/22,31,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,31,33</a>]. However, children in kinship care are less likely to receive needed health services, have more unsupervised contact with birth parents, stay in foster care longer, and have less contact with agency social workers than those in traditional foster care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/24,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,34,35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The American Academy of Pediatrics Council on Foster Care, Adoption, and Kinship Care states that placement of a child in kinship care be &quot;based on a careful assessment of the needs of the child and of the ability of the kinship care to meet those needs. As with all foster care placements, kinship care must be supervised adequately&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specialized or therapeutic foster homes &ndash; Specialized or therapeutic foster homes are those in which foster parents have extra training and education <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> provide care for children with special needs (eg, emotional disturbances, chronic medical illness, major developmental disabilities). A few successful therapeutic foster parenting models have been developed in which foster parents receive detailed education and training and ongoing support from a mental health specialist in managing a child or teen with significant mental health problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Unfortunately, in most localities, the term &quot;therapeutic&quot; is applied more loosely, and foster parents may not receive the level of training, support, and supervision necessary to help children heal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/11,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,38</a>]. With few exceptions, the outcomes for children placed in these treatment homes have not been studied rigorously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Residential or group homes &ndash; Approximately 12 percent of children in foster care live in group homes or residential treatment facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In general, these &quot;congregate care facilities&quot; care for older children and adolescents with significant mental health or behavioral problems. Professional supervision is available on site to trained staff, and most states have detailed regulations covering health and safety. However, there are no federal laws or regulations governing congregate care, and quality varies substantially. The lack of foster homes willing to care for adolescents in foster care forces states to rely on group care for this age group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Residential treatment facilities are intended to provide time-limited placement for diagnosis and treatment, but care often becomes extended for adolescents with major mental health issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Because children require a continuous, nurturing caregiver for optimal emotional and cognitive development, facilities with rotating staff may not be in their best interests. Given the lack of data regarding the impact of group care on outcomes, group care should be reserved for extreme situations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The shortage of foster parents, especially in large urban settings, has led to an increased use of &quot;shelters&quot; (ie, short-term, emergency housing pending longer term placement) when children are removed from their parents. Even with state regulations limiting the duration of such placements, agencies are often forced to maintain children in these groups care facilities for longer periods as they search for a family home setting.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Birth parents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Birth parents retain legal guardianship of their children and are expected to cooperate with the child welfare agency in designing and implementing the service plan that will permit reunification with their children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Most birth parents, however, have multiple challenges, including their own mental health <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> substance abuse issues. At least 10 percent of birth parents are cognitively delayed, and few experienced a normal, predictable upbringing themselves. Approximately 33 percent of birth parents have a history of childhood abuse and neglect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Many birth parents require a range of services (mental health, substance abuse treatment, housing, job training, parenting skills training), not all of which may be available in their communities or in appropriate settings. Parenting skills training, in particular, often occurs in a classroom, in isolation from their children, when one-to-one mentoring during visitation may be more beneficial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Visitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Visitation is a mandatory component of foster care and is the single best predictor of reunification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Visits are intended to maintain and improve the quality of the child-parent relationship. They provide the child welfare agency with an opportunity to monitor parent compliance with the case management plan and to evaluate parent-child interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Visits also provide an opportunity to offer trauma-informed mental health services, such as parent-child interaction therapy or child-parent psychotherapy, which have been associated with improved outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>However, visitation is stressful for all involved parties; children may react to parental visits with an increase in behavioral problems even when the visits are going well and are desirable to the child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/10,16,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16,42</a>]. Children in foster care worry about their parents, and the separation at the end of each visit may evoke intense fear in the child. Conflict between the foster parent and birth parent, differences in parenting styles, erratic parental compliance, and unrealistic expectations regarding the quality or outcome of the visits may create confusion, anxiety, or anger in children. Occasionally, birth parents engage in subtle or provocative behaviors that remind children of prior trauma.</p><p>Visitation supervisors must be alert to safety issues, including emotional safety issues, for children. Foster parents can help the children in their care by preparing them for visits with their birth parent(s) and assuring them that the foster parents will be there to greet them after the visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Rescheduling visits that significantly disrupt the child's routines can improve the quality of the visits. Visits that are scheduled during a child's usual nap-time, that conflict with a child or teen's favorite activity, or disrupt the school day should be rescheduled.</p><p>Involving the child's therapist in the visits, changing the setting, or increasing the level of supervision may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In rare circumstances, suspension of visits with parents may be necessary (eg, if the parent behaves in ways that traumatize the child, or if there is no realistic chance that the parent will be able to care for the child in the future) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Although the preferred practice is for agencies to hire and train child welfare professionals to support birth parents and children through visitation, some agencies rely on foster or kinship caregivers to monitor or supervise visits if child welfare professionals are not available. Caregivers may identify concerns about the behavior of the birth parent but feel constrained in reporting because of concern about the impact on their relationship with the birth parent or that the birth parent will request a placement change.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Termination of parental rights</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The birth parents may lose their parental rights through voluntary surrender or through a legal process called &quot;termination of parental rights.&quot;</p><p>Voluntary surrender of parental rights is infrequent. However, occasionally a birth parent makes the difficult decision that adoption is in the best interest of their child and voluntarily surrenders his or her rights.
