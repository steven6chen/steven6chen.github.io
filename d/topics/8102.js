Intracerebral hemorrhage is defined by intraparenchymal hemorrhage or a combination of intraparenchymal and intraventricular hemorrhage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F108187\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108187 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>Despite its common usage, the term hemorrhagic stroke remains confusing. It has been used to denote hemorrhagic transformation of arterial ischemic stroke or of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, but it does not encompass those entities, strictly speaking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1276673577\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although stroke in children is relatively rare compared with adults, it is a significant cause of childhood death and lifelong disability. A stroke suffered within the first decade may cause functional sequelae for multiple decades to follow. Hemorrhagic stroke is a notable contributor to childhood morbidity and mortality, as it accounts for about half of all childhood strokes, compared with &lt;20 percent of adult strokes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The estimated incidence of stroke in children ranges 2 to 13 per 100,000 children per year in the developed world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. A study of a California-wide hospital discharge database for first stroke admission for children ages 1 month through 19 years found an annual incidence rate of 1.1 per 100,000 children for hemorrhagic stroke and 1.2 per 100,000 children for ischemic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Similarly, a retrospective cohort study of 2.3 million children (age &lt;20 years) followed for more than a decade revealed an average annual incidence rate of 1.4 per 100,000 children for hemorrhagic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Among hemorrhagic stroke subtypes, the estimated annual incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage in developed countries ranges from 1.1 to 5.2 per 100,000 children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], while the estimated annual incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage is 0.4 per 100,000 children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2949187306\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ruptured vascular malformations are the most common cause of intracerebral hemorrhage in children. In contrast, hypertension and amyloid angiopathy are the most frequent causes of intracerebral hemorrhage in adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Etiologies'</a>.)</p><p>Aneurysms are the most common cause of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage in both adults and children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: Epidemiology, risk factors, and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1624654617\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular malformations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depending on the series, vascular malformations are responsible for 38 to 74 percent of childhood intracerebral hemorrhage cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>], with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) being the most common type and cavernous malformations and aneurysms found less frequently (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F108188\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108188 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>AVMs consist of abnormal direct connections between arteries and veins without intervening capillaries that give rise to high-flow lesions extremely prone to rupture (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brain-arteriovenous-malformations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brain arteriovenous malformations&quot;</a>). The incidence of cerebral AVMs in adults has been estimated to be 1 per 100,000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Many AVM lesions are thought to be congenital, so this estimate may reflect the incidence in children as well; however, only a small percentage of AVMs (estimated 8 to 20 percent) become symptomatic under the age of 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The risk of hemorrhage from a cerebral AVM in children has been estimated at 2 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. AVMs account for 14 to 46 percent of intracerebral hemorrhage in children and nearly 50 percent of intraparenchymal hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Arteriovenous fistulas differ from AVMs because there is an absence of a discrete nidus between the arterial feeder and draining vein. Arteriovenous fistulas are worth noting as these also carry a significant risk of hemorrhage of 1.5 percent per year. However, arteriovenous fistulas are much rarer, comprising only 4 percent of pediatric cerebral vascular malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Cavernous malformations (cavernomas or cavernous angiomas) have an estimated annual incidence of 0.56 per 100,000 people, which is approximately one-half that of AVMs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Cavernous malformations consist of dilated sinusoidal vessels lined by endothelium without intervening neural parenchyma. &quot;Leaking&quot; of blood into surrounding tissue can occur due to dysfunctional endothelial cell connections. These are considered to be low-flow lesions. Cavernous malformations have been found to have a prevalence of 0.5 percent in autopsy studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>] and are estimated to account for 20 to 25 percent of pediatric intraparenchymal hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/3,14,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14,21</a>]. While symptoms may manifest in all age groups, affected children tend to cluster in two age groups: infants and toddlers under the age of 3 years and children in early puberty, ages 12 to 16 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>While aneurysms are one of the most common vascular anomalies of the central nervous system, they are far less common in children than in adults, with a reported prevalence ranging from 0.5 to 5 percent of the total prevalence of intracranial aneurysms in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/24-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-31</a>]. Aneurysms in children are felt to be different from those in adults in the following respects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/25,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,31-33</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pediatric aneurysms tend to be larger in size</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a higher incidence of giant aneurysms in children</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There tends to be a male predominance in children</p><p/><p>The most common cause of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage in children and adolescents is rupture of a cerebral aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Ruptured aneurysms can also cause intraparenchymal hemorrhage or can present with nonhemorrhagic symptoms like headaches or seizures. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2480105387\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematologic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In reports from developed countries, hematologic abnormalities (including thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction, hemophilia and other congenital or acquired coagulopathies, and hemoglobinopathies) were the major risk factor for pediatric hemorrhagic stroke in 10 to 30 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In resource-limited countries, intracerebral hemorrhage secondary to underlying hematologic disorders occurs more frequently than hemorrhage due to vascular malformations. A retrospective study of 50 children with intracerebral hemorrhage at a single institution in Pakistan demonstrated that 52 percent had bleeding disorders compared with 14 percent with vascular malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Similarly, a retrospective analysis of 94 children with hemorrhagic stroke in China found that 88 percent of patients had a bleeding diathesis compared with 14 percent with AVM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Special populations with hematologic abnormalities include children with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), hemophilia, and sickle cell disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With ITP, intracranial hemorrhage is estimated to occur in up to 1 percent.

One report suggested that children with SCD had a &gt;200-fold higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke compared with children without SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In other reports, specific factors associated with hemorrhage in children with SCD included premorbid hypertension, transfusion within the last 14 days, treatment with glucocorticoids, low steady-state hemoglobin concentration, high steady-state leukocyte count, and late effects of moyamoya-type vasculopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>].

In one case series of 69 children with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, brain tumors accounted for 13 percent cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In another case series from a tertiary cancer center, intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in 3 percent of over 1000 children with brain tumors and in 1 percent of nearly 1600 children with acute leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1659969587\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although much less common than in the adult population, hypertension has also been associated with intracerebral hemorrhage in children. In one small retrospective cohort study, 45 percent of children with intracerebral hemorrhage had elevated blood pressure above the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile at presentation; however, only 14 percent continued to have persistently elevated blood pressure on follow-up, and none required antihypertensive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Another cause of hemorrhagic stroke in childhood is moyamoya disease. Ischemic cerebrovascular events, either transient ischemic attack or infarction, are more prevalent than hemorrhagic events in children with moyamoya, while hemorrhagic stroke is more common in adults. However, moyamoya can cause either intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage in children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moyamoya-disease-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moyamoya disease: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Cohort studies have shown that 9 to 23 percent of childhood intracerebral hemorrhage remains cryptogenic without a definitive risk factor identified despite extensive evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. However, some proportion of these cryptogenic cases may be due to vascular malformations that have self-obliterated at the time of the incident hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Among full-term neonates who present with hemorrhagic stroke in the perinatal period (birth to 28 days of life), most cases are cryptogenic; coagulopathy, congenital heart disease, fetal distress, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are major risk factors, while vascular malformations are uncommon. Perinatal stroke is reviewed separately.

In contrast, older children (&ge;6 years of age) often presented with headache and focal neurologic deficits in addition to symptoms of mental status change and <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting,</span> allowing clinicians to quickly narrow the differential diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another cohort study found that children younger than three years of age at time of hemorrhage onset (n = 9) presented with vague symptoms of general deterioration, increased crying and sleepiness, irritability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, and sepsis-like symptoms with cold extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>The onset of clinical symptoms due to hemorrhagic stroke is variable and ranges from rapid occurrence over minutes to insidious progression over several hours to days. In a cohort study of 22 children with intracerebral hemorrhage, the median time to hospital presentation was 70 minutes, but 23 percent of children presented after 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>A prospective study of 53 children with intracerebral hemorrhage found that acute symptomatic seizures, defined as those occurring from presentation to seven days after onset, occurred in 36 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Thus, acute symptomatic seizures with intracerebral hemorrhage may be more common in children than in adults, where the corresponding rate is estimated to range from 5 to 30 percent (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>). Further, children with intracerebral hemorrhage may present with seizures more commonly than children with arterial ischemic stroke, in whom seizures at stroke onset have been reported in 22 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Cortical involvement of intracerebral hemorrhage, which is an important predictor of acute symptomatic seizures in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>], was not related to acute symptomatic seizures in the pediatric intracerebral hemorrhage cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>The pace of symptom onset may be related to the underlying etiology, with aneurysm rupture expected to correlate with sudden onset, while other mechanisms may allow for subacute onset, at least in some cases. However, data are sparse. In a small cohort study of children with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, approximately half had acute onset of symptoms while the other half had a subacute course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Among children with a known onset, there were four with aneurysms, and the presentation was acute in three; among 16 children with arteriovenous malformation and known onset, an acute presentation occurred in 10 cases (63 percent). Other factors that could affect the rapidity of symptom development are size and location of hemorrhage, intraventricular extension, and presence of hydrocephalus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H996764328\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of hemorrhagic stroke requires confirmation by brain imaging with CT or MRI. Therefore, clinical suspicion for hemorrhage in the setting of a compatible presentation (eg, headache, mental status changes, seizure, vomiting, or focal neurologic deficits) as described above should prompt urgent imaging. (See <a href=\"#H1743456533\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features and presentation'</a> above.)</p><p>For children of school age or older, the acute onset of headache, particularly when severe, (eg, sometimes reported as the &quot;worst headache of life&quot;) should prompt evaluation for intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, the diagnosis of hemorrhagic stroke in children can be difficult because the presentation is often nonspecific and subacute. In one small study, most cases with delayed diagnosis (7 of 11) had subacute onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The initial evaluation should center on rapid diagnosis of the hemorrhage, assessment for presence of elevated intracranial pressure, and identification of easily correctible risk factors such as thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy.</p><p>Children with hemorrhagic stroke are also at increased risk of subsequent ischemic stroke due to compression of blood vessels from mass effect from the intracerebral hemorrhage, vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage, or underlying vasculopathy (such as moyamoya or cocaine-induced vasculopathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1756161034\"><span class=\"h2\">Urgent neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuroimaging with CT or MRI as the initial study is recommended to determine the cause, to distinguish hemorrhagic stroke from ischemic stroke, and to distinguish stroke from stroke mimics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. CT is quick, widely available, does not require sedation in most cases, and is highly sensitive for acute hemorrhage. MRI with gradient echo <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> susceptibility-weighted sequences is equally sensitive for acute hemorrhage and more sensitive for chronic hemorrhage than CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

However, MRI is not universally available and may require sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In a stable patient, MRI is preferred because of the lack of radiation and the better resolution of the parenchyma.

There are currently no established evidence-based diagnostic or management guidelines for children with hemorrhagic stroke. The American Heart Association (AHA) scientific statement for the management of stroke in infants and children includes recommendations for children with hemorrhagic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], which are mostly extrapolated from adult guidelines or are based on expert opinion derived from small retrospective pediatric studies. </p><p>Immediate consultations should be obtained from neurosurgery and neurology; hematology should also be consulted if hematologic abnormalities are present on laboratory studies or are suspected. Platelet transfusion may be required if there is thrombocytopenia or concern for platelet dysfunction. Coagulopathy may require intravenous vitamin K <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fresh frozen plasma, and children with factor VIII or IX deficiency typically require urgent factor replacement.

Prophylactic anticonvulsant treatment is unproven, though there are no high-quality studies of prophylactic anticonvulsant administration in pediatric hemorrhagic stroke. The AHA pediatric stroke guidelines recommend against prophylactic anticonvulsant use in ischemic stroke and do not make recommendations regarding their use in intracerebral hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. We agree with the AHA guidelines for management of intracerebral hemorrhage, which recommend against prophylactic anticonvulsants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>While treatment of hypertension is a mainstay of hemorrhagic stroke management in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], no clear evidence for managing hypertension after intracerebral hemorrhage exists in children. It may be a reasonable goal to lower a child's blood pressure to the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for age and sex if elevated after hemorrhage to help prevent hematoma expansion. However, this is not evidence based and may cause a reduction in cerebral perfusion, thereby exacerbating secondary brain injury, particularly if there is elevated intracranial pressure.

This contrasts with acute ischemic stroke, in which increased ICP typically develops several days after the incident event as infarcted brain tissue become edematous.</p><p>To help reduce or prevent elevated ICP, the head of the bed should be elevated to at least 30 degrees, and the neck should be maintained in a midline position to promote venous drainage. Signs and symptoms of elevated ICP should be frequently reassessed, including presence of positional headache, vomiting, irritability or combativeness, declining mental status, sixth nerve palsies, and papilledema. While Cushing's triad (ie, hypertension, bradycardia, and respiratory depression) is highly suggestive of elevated ICP, this is typically a late finding. </p><p>For any neurologic deterioration, a head CT should be obtained promptly to assess for worsening hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, edema, or herniation. Direct ongoing measurement of ICP may require placement of an intraventricular catheter, which can also aid in ICP reduction via direct cerebrospinal fluid drainage, or a subdural bolt if an intraventricular catheter is not technically feasible due to small size of a child's ventricles or other reasons.</p><p>Nonsurgical interventions for management of increased ICP include hyperventilation to PCO<sub>2</sub> of 25 to 30 mmHg (if the child is intubated) and hyperosmolar therapy with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mannitol</a> (bolus 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg,</span> given as an intravenous infusion through an in-line filter over 20 to 30 minutes, followed by infusions of 0.25 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> as needed, generally every six to eight hours) or hypertonic saline to promote osmotic diuresis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-management#H4105818266\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in children: Management&quot;, section on 'Hyperosmolar therapy'</a>). If hyperosmolar therapy is administered, close monitoring of plasma osmoles and electrolytes is required to avoid hypovolemia, hypotension, and renal failure. Glucocorticoids should be avoided because they did not improve outcomes in randomized controlled trials of adults with intracerebral hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>], and the resultant hyperglycemia may lead to worse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. </p><p>Ultimately, these medical interventions are only temporizing measures, and surgical evacuation of a parenchymal hematoma or decompressive craniectomy may be necessary to control refractory elevations in ICP <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mass effect. Surgical hemorrhage evacuation for supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage is controversial, and no high-quality studies in children have evaluated early surgical hematoma evacuation or hemicraniectomy. In adults, randomized trials have not conclusively demonstrated benefit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-treatment-and-prognosis#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Surgery'</a>.)</p><p>As children typically lack the baseline cerebral atrophy found in older adults that permits expansion of the hematoma without consequent compression of the surrounding parenchyma, it is biologically plausible that children may benefit from hematoma evacuation to reduce ICP. If a child is undergoing resection of an underlying vascular malformation that is at high risk for acute rebleeding, it may be optimal to concurrently evacuate the hematoma. Surgical evaluation also might be warranted if a child is comatose, has elevated intracranial pressure that is refractory to medical management, or a worsening neurological examination. As in adults, cerebellar hemorrhages &gt;3 cm in diameter in a child who is deteriorating or in whom brainstem compression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hydrocephalus is developing due to compression on the ventricular system should also be considered for surgical evacuation. If a cerebellar hemorrhage is evacuated, suboccipital craniectomy is typically performed at the same time.</p><p>While hemicraniectomy has not been studied in the setting of pediatric hemorrhagic stroke, there are some series in which hemicraniectomy was associated with improved function and survival in pediatric arterial ischemic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. In a child who undergoes surgical hematoma evacuation due to a supratentorial hemorrhage causing elevated intracranial pressure that is refractory to medical management, the surgeon may elect to perform a concomitant hemicraniectomy, particularly if the intracranial pressure remains elevated after hematoma evacuation or if there is herniation out of the craniotomy defect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3691856940\"><span class=\"h2\">Identifying the etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obtaining dedicated cerebrovascular imaging in the acute setting is critical to guide appropriate interventions given the high rate of vascular malformations underlying hemorrhagic stroke in children. While conventional cerebral angiography remains the gold standard, many institutions opt to first use noninvasive modalities. One retrospective study found that a combination of MRI, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) images accurately identified the cause of intracerebral hemorrhage in 66 percent of subjects, which was statistically equivalent to the diagnostic yield of conventional cerebral angiography alone (61 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. However, another retrospective case series of children with nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage reported identification of the cause of bleeding in 97 percent of children who underwent conventional cerebral angiography compared with 80 percent of children who did not have angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Another alternative is CT angiography (CTA), which can be rapidly obtained without the need for sedation in some children, is more widely available than MRA, and may offer superior angioarchitectural visualization compared with MRA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. CTA also has a higher sensitivity for detecting aneurysms up to 2 mm in size. However, CTA exposes the child to both ionizing radiation and an iodinated contrast agent, requires a large bore intravenous line, and may be nondiagnostic if the child moves during the study.</p><p>For children with hemorrhagic stroke and no identified cause despite a thorough evaluation, including appropriate noninvasive vascular imaging, we suggest conventional cerebral angiography. This recommendation is in general agreement with AHA guidelines for pediatric stroke, which state that conventional cerebral angiography should be considered when no cause for hemorrhagic stroke is found via noninvasive vascular imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. As an acute hemorrhage with large hematoma and significant cerebral edema can obscure visualization of an underlying vascular malformation, vascular studies that are initially nondiagnostic should be repeated weeks to months later once the clot has been reabsorbed if no other cause for the hemorrhage (eg, tumor, coagulopathy) is found.</p><p>The yield of an extensive evaluation for a bleeding diathesis in children with hemorrhagic stroke is not well-studied. The AHA guidelines for the evaluation and management of stroke in infants and children note that an evaluation for hematologic disorders and coagulation defects is appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. A rational approach is to obtain the screening laboratory studies suggested above (see <a href=\"#H1662346826\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory studies'</a> above) (ie, a complete blood count with platelets, coagulation studies, prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, and activated partial thromboplastin time) and to pursue additional testing if the screening studies are abnormal or if an underlying vascular lesion or tumor is not found. Higher-level studies may include factor VIII, IX, and XIII levels and von Willebrand disease studies and should be ordered in consultation with a hematologist. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183484907\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of vascular lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endovascular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgical management of vascular malformations may be required in the acute setting depending on the location and vascular anatomy of the lesion in conjunction with the clinical status of the child. Vascular malformations other than aneurysm typically have a low risk of acute rebleeding (although they may rebleed at later times) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-69</a>]. Therefore, many centers will await hematoma resolution prior to definitive treatment so that the full extent of the vascular malformation can be elucidated. However, if hematoma evacuation is needed, a vascular malformation may be addressed at the same time. Some arteriovenous malformations that cannot be treated with endovascular or surgical techniques may be amenable to gamma knife or proton beam therapy once the hematoma has retracted.</p><p>Aneurysms have a higher rate of acute rebleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Therefore, aneurysm repair typically occurs in the acute setting. Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) with an aneurysmal component that may cause acute rebleeding also may require earlier intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2022052019\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the high risk of recurrence, we suggest follow-up imaging for most children with hemorrhagic stroke due to a vascular malformation. In addition, we suggest follow-up imaging in cases where a vascular cause is not found but is suspected.</p><p>Even when complete resection of an arteriovenous malformation is achieved, there is a substantial risk of recurrence. In one retrospective report of 28 children who underwent surgical resection of arteriovenous malformations, 4 had recurrence leading to repeat resections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Of note, two of the children in this cohort had arteriovenous malformations that were not detected until 17.7 and 25 months after the incident hemorrhage.</p><p>While the frequency and modality of follow-up imaging is center-dependent, our suggested protocol is to obtain brain MRI with MRA at three to six months after the first hemorrhage, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a conventional angiogram between three and six months. Additional follow-up imaging at later points is typically necessary. In children with an unresected cavernous malformation, periodic imaging with MRI is suggested if the child is having frequent symptoms such as headaches or seizures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3951099873\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The estimated mortality rate for children with hemorrhagic stroke ranges from 5 to 33 percent, and many studies (largely retrospective) report that neurologic outcomes are poor in approximately 25 to 57 percent of children, as discussed in the sections that follow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4096266175\"><span class=\"h2\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older studies show that hemorrhagic stroke has a significantly higher mortality than arterial ischemic stroke in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/3,21,72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,21,72,73</a>] but lower mortality compared with that in the adult population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

The mean IQ scores of the surviving patients were not below the population mean IQ scores, and the distribution was not shifted to lower levels; however, 48 percent had signs of cognitive deficits when their performance was compared with their premorbid academic abilities or with those of their parents.

The 30-day mortality is approximately 90 percent if the size of the hemorrhage exceeds 60 cm<sup>3</sup> and the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) is &lt;9 at presentation. This compares with an estimated 19 percent mortality when the hemorrhage volume is &lt;30 cm<sup>3</sup> and the GCS is &ge;9 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-treatment-and-prognosis#H8754571\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Risk factors for poor outcomes'</a>.)</p><p>Similarly, poor outcome in children with intracerebral hemorrhage is associated with larger hemorrhage volume, with the important distinction that hemorrhage volume must be taken in the context of percentage of total brain volume (TBV) to account for the markedly varying brain sizes of children of different ages. Another reported predictor of poor outcome in children after intracerebral hemorrhage is the early development of altered mental status. The following observations have been made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective report of 30 consecutive children, the strongest association with outcome was the intraparenchymal component of intracerebral hemorrhage expressed as a percentage of TBV; intraparenchymal hemorrhage &ge;4 percent of TBV was independently associated with poor outcome, defined as severe disability or death (odds ratio [OR] 22.5, 95% CI 1.4-354) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The odds of poor outcome at 30 days increased significantly for every 10 cm<sup>3</sup> of additional hemorrhage volume.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study of 20 children with supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage found that hemorrhage volume &gt;2 percent of TBV was associated with poor outcomes compared with hemorrhage volume &le;2 percent of TBV. In addition, altered mental status within six hours of hospitalization was associated with both clinically significant disability and with supratentorial hemorrhage volume &gt;2 percent of TBV, suggesting that altered mental status may serve as an early clinical sign of larger and more severe intracerebral hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study analyzed a three-year sample from a nationwide database of more than 1100 children hospitalized in the US with a primary diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Lacking data on hemorrhage volume, the factors most strongly associated with mortality were coma (OR 9, 95% CI 3.2-24.6) and coagulopathy (OR 3, 95% CI 1.6-6.0); other associated factors were transfusion, older age (11 to 18 years), and Hispanic ethnicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Hypertension was more common among patients who died compared with those who survived (20 percent versus 10 percent) but the difference was not statistically significant.</p><p/><p>Studies in adults suggest that posterior fossa hemorrhage and presence of intraventricular hemorrhage are predictors of poor outcome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-treatment-and-prognosis#H8754571\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Risk factors for poor outcomes'</a>). However, data from small pediatric cohort studies have not confirmed that these factors predict poor outcome in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/46,48,77,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,48,77,84</a>].</p><p>The adult intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>] is the most commonly used clinical grading scale for predicting mortality and functional outcome following adult intracerebral hemorrhage (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-treatment-and-prognosis#H8754595\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'ICH score'</a>). A similar pediatric ICH score was developed to assist with risk stratification in children following intracerebral hemorrhage. While the pediatric ICH score mirrors its adult counterpart, several components required alterations. Hemorrhage volume was expressed as a percent of total brain volume to account for the varying brain sizes of children of different ages. Due to the lack of availability of GCS scores in most children, the presence of herniation was used. Isolated intraventricular hemorrhage had not been predictive of outcome in previous studies and was present in about 40 percent of children, so this variable was replaced with hydrocephalus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Thus, the pediatric ICH score is comprised of the following components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraparenchymal hemorrhage volume as percentage of TBV</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&lt;2 percent = 0 points</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>2 to 3.99 percent = 1 point</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&ge;4 percent = 2 points</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hydrocephalus?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No = 0 points</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Yes = 1 point</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Herniation?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No = 0 points</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Yes = 1 point</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infratentorial location?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No = 0 points</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Yes = 1 point</p><p/><p>Therefore, the total pediatric ICH score ranges from 0 to 5 points (adult score ranges from 0 to 6 points).</p><p>In one prospective cohort of 60 children with intracerebral hemorrhage, a pediatric ICH score &ge;2 was sensitive for predicting severe disability or death and a score &ge;1 was sensitive for predicting moderate disability or worse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. However, the pediatric ICH score has not been established as generally valid in independent populations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2308050477\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemorrhagic stroke recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from pooled studies suggest that recurrence risk after hemorrhagic stroke in childhood is approximately 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>], but the length of follow-up in these studies was highly variable. Limited data suggest that the risk of recurrence depends mainly on etiology; children with untreated or incompletely treated vascular malformations and those with hematologic disorders appear to have the highest risk of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/21,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,87</a>]. In a population-based retrospective cohort study of 116 children with nontraumatic hemorrhagic stroke in northern California who were followed for a mean of 4.2 years, a recurrent hemorrhagic stroke affected 11 children at a median of approximately three months (range 7 days to 5.7 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The highest risk period was the first six months. The estimated five-year cumulative recurrence rate was 10 percent (95% CI 5-18 percent). Among the 11 recurrent hemorrhagic strokes, there were 5 due to cavernous malformations, 2 caused by to arteriovenous malformation, 2 attributed to tumor, 1 with hypertension, and 1 with idiopathic thrombocytopenia. Among the 9 children with a second hemorrhage and a structural cause (vascular malformation or tumor), the lesion was untreated in 6 and partially treated in 2 (partially resected tumor and second cavernous malformation which was not the cause of first hemorrhage). There were no recurrences among 29 children with idiopathic hemorrhagic stroke.</p><p>Another study monitored adults and children with brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) for a total of 3620 person-years in the adult group and 996 person-years in the childhood group, starting from initial presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhagic-stroke-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The unadjusted rates of subsequent intracerebral hemorrhage were similar for children and adults (2.0 and 2.2 percent, respectively) However, compared with adults, children with AVMs were more likely to present with hemorrhage, and after adjusting for the higher proportion of hemorrhagic presentation in children, the risk of a subsequent intracerebral hemorrhage was lower for children (hazard ratio 0.1, 95% CI 0.01-0.86). These results suggest that cerebral AVMs in children do not need to be treated more aggressively than those in adults. However, although their annualized risk of hemorrhage is similar to adults, their cumulative risk is greater given their greater number of years left to live.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1730036729\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Intracerebral hemorrhage is defined by intraparenchymal hemorrhage with or without associated intraventricular hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H1743221237\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhagic stroke is a notable contributor to childhood morbidity and mortality, accounting for approximately one-half of all childhood strokes. (See <a href=\"#H1276673577\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhagic stroke in children is most commonly caused by ruptured vascular malformations in developed countries, though risk factors may be different elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H2949187306\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common presenting symptom of hemorrhagic stroke in children is headache. Other common presenting symptoms include nausea and emesis, seizures, neck pain, focal neurologic deficits, and altered level of consciousness. (See <a href=\"#H1743456533\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features and presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of hemorrhagic stroke requires confirmation by brain imaging with CT or MRI. The differential diagnosis for hemorrhagic stroke includes a broad list of diagnoses that can mimic stroke syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F108249\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108249 \">table 1</a>), with the most common being migraine syndromes and postictal (Todd) paralysis. (See <a href=\"#H996764328\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2515180411\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of hemorrhagic stroke management include stabilization of the patient with treatment of elevated intracranial pressure if present, and prevention of further brain injury. Cerebrovascular imaging in the acute setting is critical to guide appropriate interventions given the high rate of vascular malformations underlying hemorrhagic stroke in children. (See <a href=\"#H4072518160\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated mortality rate for children with hemorrhagic stroke ranges from 5 to 33 percent, and mainly retrospective data suggest poor neurologic outcomes in approximately 25 to 57 percent.
