HFMD is one of the most recognizable viral exanthems in children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-and-herpangina/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. HFMD was first described in a summer outbreak that occurred in Toronto, Canada in 1957 and was caused by coxsackievirus A16 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-and-herpangina/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Since then, at least 15 other enterovirus serotypes have been shown to cause HFMD, most commonly Coxsackievirus A serotypes.</p><p>Herpangina is a benign clinical syndrome characterized by fever and a painful papulo-vesiculo-ulcerative oral enanthem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-and-herpangina/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It can be clinically differentiated from HFMD and primary herpetic gingivostomatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-and-herpangina/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Herpangina was first described in the 1920s but the viral etiology was not established until 1951 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-and-herpangina/abstract/4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7</a>]. Herpangina is caused by 22 enterovirus serotypes, most commonly Coxsackievirus A serotypes.</p><p>An overview of HFMD and herpangina will be presented here. Other enterovirus infections are discussed separately.

Enterovirus A71 has been associated with outbreaks involving thousands of persons in the Asia-Pacific region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-and-herpangina/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Beginning in 2008, coxsackievirus A6 has been increasingly reported as a cause of outbreaks of HFMD around the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-and-herpangina/abstract/10-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-17</a>].

In the Asia-Pacific region, where large outbreaks of enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus A16 have occurred, these serotypes are a common cause of herpangina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-and-herpangina/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456270575\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human enterovirus infection occurs after oral ingestion of virus that is shed from the gastrointestinal or upper respiratory tract of infected individuals (ie, via the ingestion of fecal material, oral secretions, or, for some serotypes, respiratory secretions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-and-herpangina/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Human enterovirus infection also may occur following contact with vesicle fluid or oral and respiratory secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-and-herpangina/abstract/3,11,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11,23</a>].</p><p>Virus may be detected in the stool for six weeks and sometimes for several months after infection. The duration of shedding from the oropharynx is generally less than four weeks. Prolonged shedding in the stool and the innate environmental stability of the enteroviruses, favors their transmission.</p><p>Once ingested, the enteroviruses replicate in the submucosal lymphoid tissues of the lower intestine and, to a lesser extent, the pharynx. Following replication, the enteroviruses spread to the regional lymph nodes. Replication at these sites results in a &quot;minor viremia&quot; that disseminates virus throughout the body, resulting in infection of reticuloendothelial tissues and multiple organs (eg, central nervous system, heart, liver, skin). Replication at these sites is responsible for the clinical manifestations of enteroviral infections. Further replication at the disseminated sites leads to a &quot;major viremia,&quot; which continues until the host produces type-specific antibodies. Enterovirus replication in organ tissues results in death of infected cells, with accompanying inflammation and necrosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enterovirus and parechovirus infections: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Biopsies of HFMD vesicular lesions show loose stands of fibrin, lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils within the vesicular fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-and-herpangina/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Extensive acantholysis with reticular degeneration is seen in the overlying epidermis with perivascular foci of lymphocytic, monocytic, and neutrophilic leukocytes in the upper dermis. Light microscopy of biopsies or scrapings of vesicles does <strong>not </strong>demonstrate nuclear inclusion bodies and multinucleated giant cells, which helps to distinguish HFMD from varicella zoster virus and herpes simplex virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-and-herpangina/abstract/2,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,24-26</a>].

Most cases occur in children younger than five to seven years. However, all age groups, including adults, may be affected. (See <a href=\"#H456270581\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H456270561\" class=\"local\">'Virology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The viruses that cause HFMD and herpangina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96785 \">table 1</a>) usually are transmitted from person to person by the fecal-oral route; they also can be transmitted by oral and respiratory secretions and, in cases of HFMD, vesicle fluid. The incubation period usually is three to five days. (See <a href=\"#H456270587\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above and <a href=\"#H456270593\" class=\"local\">'Incubation period'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HFMD presents with mouth or throat pain or refusal to eat. Fever if present, generally is low grade (below 38.3&deg;C [101&deg;F]). The oral lesions, which may occur in isolation, usually occur on the tongue and buccal mucosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F71314%7EDERM%2F58566\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71314 graphicRef58566 \">picture 1A-B</a>). They begin as macules and progress to vesicles, which rupture to form superficial ulcers. Oral lesions are painful and may interfere with oral intake. The skin lesions, which may occur in isolation, are nonpruritic and nontender (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F53423\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53423 \">picture 2</a>). They may be macular, maculopapular, or vesicular and typically involve the hands, feet, buttocks (particularly in infants and young children), and extremities. (See <a href=\"#H4639421\" class=\"local\">'Hand, foot, and mouth disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HFMD caused by enterovirus A71 has been associated with severe illness, complicated by central nervous system disease pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, and heart failure. (See <a href=\"#H10169689\" class=\"local\">'Enterovirus A71 HFMD'</a> above and <a href=\"#H456270631\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical HFMD is associated with a novel coxsackievirus A6 genotype. It is more severe than &quot;typical&quot; HFMD. Clinical features include higher fever; wider distribution of lesions; vesiculobullous lesions, bullae, erosions, ulcerations, and eschar; longer duration; <span class=\"nowrap\">palmar/plantar</span> desquamation; and nail dystrophy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F94553\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94553 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96786\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96786 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F108969\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108969 \">picture 6</a>). (See <a href=\"#H456270625\" class=\"local\">'Coxsackievirus A6 HFMD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The onset of herpangina is abrupt with high fever (38.9&deg;C to 40&deg;C [102&deg;C to 104&deg;C]) and oral lesions. Vomiting, anorexia, and irritability or fussiness are frequent accompaniments. The oral lesions occur on the anterior fauces, tonsils, and soft palate. They begin as papules and rapidly progress to vesicles and finally rupture to form superficial ulcers. The lesions are painful and may interfere with oral intake. (See <a href=\"#H4639791\" class=\"local\">'Herpangina'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of HFMD and herpangina are rare. They occur more commonly with enterovirus A71 than other types of enteroviruses. (See <a href=\"#H456270631\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10169689\" class=\"local\">'Enterovirus A71 HFMD'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of HFMD usually is made clinically, based upon the typical appearance and location of the oral enanthem (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F58566%7EDERM%2F71314\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58566 graphicRef71314 \">picture 1A-B</a>) and exanthem (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F53423\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53423 \">picture 2</a>). The diagnosis of herpangina also is made clinically, based upon the typical appearance and location of the oral enanthem (fewer than 10 hyperemic <span class=\"nowrap\">yellow/greyish-white</span> papulovesicles on the anterior pillars of the fauces, soft palate, tonsils, and uvula) and associated high fever. It is seldom necessary to confirm a specific viral etiology for HFMD or herpangina. (See <a href=\"#H456270637\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of HFMD and herpangina includes other conditions associated with oral lesions (aphthous ulcers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56488%7EDERM%2F63475\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56488 graphicRef63475 \">picture 7A-B</a>), herpes simplex gingivostomatitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58944%7EPEDS%2F58542\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58944 graphicRef58542 \">picture 8A-B</a>)). In addition, the differential diagnosis of HFMD includes other conditions associated with maculopapular or vesicular rashes (eg, papular urticaria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78529%7EALLRG%2F50494\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78529 graphicRef50494 \">picture 9A-B</a>), id reaction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F52664\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52664 \">picture 11</a>), contact dermatitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81478\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81478 \">picture 12</a>), erythema multiforme major (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F80715%7EDERM%2F58969%7EDERM%2F68153\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80715 graphicRef58969 graphicRef68153 \">picture 13A-C</a>), and eczema herpeticum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74838\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74838 \">picture 14</a>)). Associated clinical features usually distinguish HFMD and herpangina from these conditions. (See <a href=\"#H456270643\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overwhelming majority of cases of HFMD and herpangina are uncomplicated; complete spontaneous resolution usually occurs within seven days. (See <a href=\"#H10169508\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with complications may require hospitalization. Management of uncomplicated HFMD and herpangina is supportive. Pain and discomfort due to fever can be managed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a>. We suggest not routinely using topical oral therapies for children with HFMD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
