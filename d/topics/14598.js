Research evidence most strongly supports the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy targeting deficits in executive function. (See <a href=\"#H3660392\" class=\"local\">'CBT targeting executive function'</a> below.) </p><p>The great majority of adults with ADHD have difficulty in some aspect of everyday executive function, particularly with respect to time-management and efficiency.

Some of the psychotherapies in this topic may not be available in some geographic areas. Earlier efforts to apply CBT to adult ADHD employed a traditional CBT approach, emphasizing distorted cognitions commonly seen in the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-adult-adhd/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In our clinical experience, psychotherapies that focus intensively on one area of dysfunction (eg, executive dysfunction, emotional dysregulation, or attentional focus) are more likely to bring about meaningful and lasting changes in functioning than psychotherapies that attempt to address a broad array of dysfunctions.

At the end of treatment, patients who received CBT experienced reduced ADHD symptoms compared to the group receiving treatment as usual; this difference was maintained at three-month follow-up.

Study participants, who were either on a stable course of medication for ADHD or unmedicated, were randomly assigned to a DBT-based skills training group or a discussion group. Outcome was based on patient self-report on an ADHD symptom checklist. An intent-to-treat analysis failed to find significant differences between groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multi-site randomized trial of 419 German adults with ADHD compared group CBT (an adapted form of DBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-adult-adhd/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]) along with clinical management and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> to clinical management and methylphenidate alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-adult-adhd/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. DBT or clinical management were provided weekly for the first 12 weeks, then monthly for nine months; methylphenidate and placebo were provided for one year. No difference in ADHD symptoms were found between the DBT and clinical management groups at three-month and one year follow-up. Patients who received methylphenidate experienced reduced ADHD symptoms compared with patients receiving placebo, regardless of whether they also received DBT or clinical management.</p><p/><p>Two uncontrolled trials with a total of 79 adults with ADHD found that DBT was associated with reduction in ADHD symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-adult-adhd/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3660434\"><span class=\"h2\">Mindfulness-based cognitive-behavioral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), a group modality used in the treatment of major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-adult-adhd/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], has been preliminarily applied to adults with ADHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-adult-adhd/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]; more rigorous study in randomized clinical trials is needed.

In the teaching of mindfulness, an individual is guided to become aware of incoming thoughts, feelings, and sensations, to observe and accept them without judgment, and then to disengage from them. Originally inspired by teachings from the East, training in mindfulness has been applied to patient stress, anxiety, pain, and other problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-adult-adhd/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>MBCT and the closely related mindfulness training are skills-training programs that combine the clinical application of mindfulness meditation with elements of cognitive therapy. </p><p>An eight-week uncontrolled trial of mindfulness training in twenty-four adults and eight adolescents with ADHD found the intervention to be associated with reduced self-reported ADHD symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-adult-adhd/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].
