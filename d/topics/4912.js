The clinical features, evaluation, and management of learning disabilities are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific learning disabilities in children: Clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-educational-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific learning disabilities in children: Educational management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific learning disabilities (LDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by the unexpected failure of an individual to acquire, retrieve, and use information competently. LDs are caused by inborn or acquired abnormalities in brain structure and function, have a multifactorial etiology, and are difficult to separate from learning failure due to lack of environmental opportunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. LDs are the most severe, pervasive, and chronic form of learning difficulty in children with average or above-average intellectual abilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Definitions of LDs vary, but the crucial element is an intrinsic cognitive difficulty that results in academic achievement at a level less than expected for the individual's intellectual potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Reading disability (RD) is traditionally believed to be the most common form of LD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>] but epidemiologic data suggest that writing and math disabilities may be just as common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Nonetheless, the majority of information about LDs is derived from studies of children with RD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Intellectual disability is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Definition, diagnosis, and assessment of needs&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Management, outcomes, and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EDUCATIONAL DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the passage of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (PL 94-142) in 1975, there has been, and continues to be, difficulty achieving clinical consensus regarding the definition of specific learning disability (LD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. The lack of definitional uniformity makes it more difficult to draw firm conclusions about effective interventions, affects the delivery and rationing of services, and affects the quality of research [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/2,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15,16</a>].</p><p>The definition and diagnostic criteria for LDs vary according to the source (eg, federal law, National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) and purpose (eg, research purposes or determination of eligibility for special educational services). There is no universally accepted definition or set of diagnostic criteria. However, the federal definition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56614\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56614 \">table 1</a>) and that proposed by the National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64300\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64300 \">table 2</a>) receive the most support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DSM-5 definition &ndash; The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) broadly categorizes LDs as &quot;specific learning disorder,&quot; which can be specified according to the type of academic domains (eg, reading, written expression, mathematics) or specific skills (eg, word reading accuracy, spelling, number sense, etc) that are involved, as well as their severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Diagnostic criteria include difficulties in a particular domain or skill that have persisted for six months despite the provision of interventions; academic skills that are substantially and quantifiably below those expected for chronologic age; impairment that interferes with academic performance or activities of daily living; and onset during the school-age years. The academic difficulties are not better accounted for by other conditions (eg, intellectual disability, visual impairment, hearing impairment, inadequate instruction, etc). The DSM 5 acknowledges the concept of &quot;unexpected under-achievement&quot; as being part of LD (ie, academic achievement is below that expected for overall intelligence). It is therefore possible to diagnose LD in children who may be gifted, as well as in those who may have intellectual disability. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>US Federal Register &ndash; The federal definition for specific learning disabilities (LDs) is found in the Federal Register and used in the Education for All Handicapped Children Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Act Amendments of 1997 and 2004 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56614\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56614 \">table 1</a>). The federal definition for specific learning disabilities is considered to be imperfect for several reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>It implies that LDs are a homogeneous condition rather than a heterogeneous group of disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/3,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22,23</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>It fails to recognize that for most affected individuals, some degree of disability persists into adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>It does not acknowledge that altered central nervous system structure or function underlie the identified difficulties with reading, writing, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> math</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>It does not mention that LDs can accompany other neurologic disorders (eg, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, amongst others) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>It does not acknowledge that LDs can be a sequela of medical treatment or a medical disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>National Joint Committee on LDs &ndash; The National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities also has proposed a definition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64300\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64300 \">table 2</a>). Similar to the federal definition, the National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities definition distinguishes between specific learning disabilities (LDs) and extrinsic or expected causes of learning problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Unlike the federal definition, the Joint Committee definition acknowledges that LDs can occur concomitantly with extrinsic conditions, such as cultural differences or insufficient or inappropriate instruction.</p><p/><p>The US Federal Register and National Joint Committee on LDs of specific learning disability (LD) contain an exclusion clause to distinguish LDs from other disabilities that cause difficulty learning in the typical classroom, such as visual, hearing, or motor disabilities; intellectual disability (mental retardation); emotional disturbance; and environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage. The DSM-5 requires that the learning difficulties are not better accounted for by other conditions. However, the DSM 5 acknowledges that LD can coexist with other conditions. </p><p>Additional features common to the Federal Register and National Joint Committee definitions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Learning disability is manifest as a discrepancy between the student's overall intelligence and the student's academic performance in reading, writing, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> math. Documentation of this discrepancy for the purpose of identifying learning disability is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-evaluation#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific learning disabilities in children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and identification of LD in school settings'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Learning disabilities can be accompanied by weaknesses in underlying psychological processes (eg, attention, concentration, visual and aural processing, and language development).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Learning disabilities have to be excluded from other disorders, such as sensory incapacity, intellectual disability, emotional disturbance, or economic or environmental circumstances, amongst others. This last criterion is problematic because learning disabilities often co-occur with these handicaps or conditions, and cannot easily be distinguished from them.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">LAWS AFFECTING THE EDUCATION OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H467858238\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pediatric primary care providers often rely on information (eg, evaluation reports) provided by schools to help determine the presence or absence of a learning disability. They also rely upon schools to provide services to students with learning disability. Although the information provided by schools is clinically useful, schools do not have a primary obligation to determine a clinical diagnosis or etiology of a student's learning difficulty. Rather, they have to determine whether students with school performance problems are eligible for services. A disability determination usually is needed for specialized services, although occasionally, services can be provided without conducting an evaluation and without deciding that a student has a disability. Disability determination in schools follows practices that differ somewhat from the practices used in making a clinical diagnosis. The sections below summarize the laws that govern the provision of services to students who have learning difficulty or who may have a learning disability, focussing on the types of services for which students are eligible and how disability determination is made in schools. </p><p>Specialized services for students with learning difficulty are available under three main laws: Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504), and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Each law has its own system for identifying students who may need specialized services. There is significant overlap in the services provided under each of these three main laws. </p><p>Eligibility for services varies according to the legal requirements of the three main laws. It also depends upon local student achievement standards, local professional standards, and funding. These factors are at least as influential as the dictates of the individual laws. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Variability in implementation'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Every Student Succeeds Act</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA, Public Law 114-95) is the 2015 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. It supersedes No Child Left Behind (authorized in 2001) and will be fully implemented in September 2017. ESSA governs general education. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Special services provided</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ESSA governs all services considered to be &quot;general&quot; education services. General education services include specialized services (eg, services for students who are neglected, delinquent, or at risk; English language learners; and at risk for academic failure; amongst others) as well as delivering a curriculum to a classroom of learners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. </p><p>Under ESSA, schools can choose to provide positive behavior supports; multitiered systems of support to address academic and mental health needs of the student body as a whole; and mental and behavioral health services to individual students, amongst other services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Local practices determine whether these services are accessed through the student health office, the classroom teacher, or another professional within the school district.</p><p>The Student Support Team or Child Study Team (the name varies by state) is an important general education service that has implications for the student with learning difficulty <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> LD. These teams are available to the classroom teacher to help understand and address learning problems in individual students. Although usually requested by the classroom teacher, referral to the Student Support Team can be requested by anyone, including parents and health care providers.</p><p>The Student Support Team may make recommendations for Early Intervening Services (EIS), also known as Responsiveness to Intervention (RTI) services. EIS and RTI are funded through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) but are provided to general education students who are not making adequate educational progress, with the goal of preventing the need to enroll them in special education. In other words, students can access RTI services without being identified as having a disability. RTI services can include <span class=\"nowrap\">psychological/behavioral</span> supports, academic interventions using research-based instructional techniques, small-group instruction, more frequent monitoring of progress, etc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Students qualifying for RTI services may be identified by the Student Support Team, but may also be identified by routine monitoring of academic performance of the classroom or school as a whole. </p><p>Specialized supports and services under ESSA can be offered for an indefinite period of time. However, RTI services typically are provided for short periods (eg, 4 to 12 weeks) after which the services are terminated (if the student has shown the necessary progress) or are extended under the <span class=\"nowrap\">rules/regulations</span> of the IDEA. Decisions regarding who receives services and how the services are delivered are made at the state and local levels. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Individuals with Disabilities Education Act'</a> below.)</p><p>One of the requirements of ESSA is the use of state-wide tests to show that educational benchmarks are being achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Performance on state-wide testing can be used to justify evaluations and services for students who show learning failure and who may have a learning disability. In contrast to No Child Left Behind, ESSA gives greater latitude at the state level to determine the standards and the methods used for statewide testing.</p><p>Using information gathered by the classroom teacher <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the student's performance with RTI services, the Student Support Team may make a recommendation for a formal evaluation. The evaluation may result in a disability determination for services under Section 504 or under the IDEA. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Individuals with Disabilities Education Act'</a> below.) </p><p>As a first step for the student with learning difficulty, the primary care practitioner can recommend that the family access the Student Support Team, or other services as described in the paragraphs above. These may include behavioral support services for students with English Language Learner Status or RTI services. However, the quality and type of services in any individual school district can vary highly. A student with learning difficulty can also undergo a formal evaluation upon request of the family or the primary care practitioner. The student support team does not have to participate in this decision. </p><p>Requesting an evaluation to determine eligibility for services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is typically a more secure route to obtaining services if the quality of the prereferral service or the student support team is uncertain. All students have a right to an evaluation to determine the presence or absence of a disability at any time. This is true whether or not the child is receiving services under general education. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Individuals with Disabilities Education Act'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Eligibility criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All school-age children are eligible for services under ESSA. Preschool and kindergarten students also are eligible for services under ESSA in states where preschool and kindergarten services are offered. School districts determine the policies and procedures for monitoring the progress and needs of students in regular education in their districts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of parents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>School teams determine whether specialized services will be offered to a general education student through ESSA (ie, in general education). Parent participation is not required and is not typical, although communication with parents is encouraged.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504) is a civil rights law. It prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68063\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68063 \">table 3</a>). Section 504 assures individuals with disabilities the right to equal access to a wide range of services. It applies to individuals of any age, including those who attend school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Because schools receive federal financial assistance, they are required to comply with the regulations of Section 504. Section 504 is an unfunded mandate. Schools do not receive specific federal grants for complying with its mandates but are at risk for losing whatever federal funding they do receive if they do not follow its mandates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Services provided</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Section 504 provides &quot;accommodations&quot; to individuals with disabilities. Accommodations can be provided at the building level or on an individual basis. A prototypical building-level accommodation is a wheelchair ramp, which assures equal access to the building for individuals who use a wheelchair. Special transportation or instructional accommodations can also be provided to qualifying individual students.</p><p>Accommodations provided to individual students in schools are provided in a 504 Accommodation Plan. Accommodations for an individual student may include increased teacher <span class=\"nowrap\">supports/monitoring,</span> increased time for tests (eg, for a student with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), behavior support plans, mental health or behavioral health services, and even services such as speech services or physical or occupational therapy for students with language or motor impairments. These services are offered if the student is not able to participate in <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> education without the services. Vision and hearing impaired students may receive accommodations, such as text provided in Braille, or amplification systems. Many or most of these services are not offered to general education students. All of these services are the same kinds of services provided in special education. However, an accommodation plan is designed only to provide the student equal access to regular education, not to provide special education. The student is thus held to regular education standards and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> education is typically not modified or individualized. The accommodations mentioned in this paragraph are provided in a regular education setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Eligibility criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In order to qualify for Section 504 accommodations, the student has to have &quot;a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities&quot; or be &quot;considered&quot; to have such an impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A wide range of disabilities may qualify the student for services, including medical conditions, developmental disabilities, emotional disturbances, etc. Documentation of a disability is required. Schools frequently use reports from the health care provider to justify an accommodation plan, however, a health care provider's evaluation is not a prerequisite for an accommodation plan. Any evaluation that meets the local school district's criteria is sufficient. Section 504 Accommodations can only be provided if the disability &quot;substantially impairs one or more major life activities.&quot; The criteria used to make this determination are developed locally. Health care providers who wish to advocate for accommodations for a student at school should furnish evidence that the student has a disability. The practitioner should also provide information about how the disability is likely to affect the child's performance at school. Section 504 protects a broader range of individuals with disabilities than the IDEA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of parents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A Section 504 evaluation can be conducted, and accommodations can be provided, without parent consent. However, parents must be notified if an evaluation takes place or if an accommodation plan is provided. Schools typically request permission to conduct an evaluation and to provide accommodations, as this is considered to be &quot;best practice.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), reauthorized in 2004 as the IDEA Improvement Act [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], guarantees the right of students with disabilities to a &quot;free, appropriate, public education.&quot; The IDEA governs educational services provided to individuals with disabilities, ages 3 to 21 years, who meet specific disability eligibility criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'IDEA eligibility criteria'</a> below.)</p><p>The IDEA is an entitlement statute and provides some funding to states that provide services under its mandates. Qualifying the student for services under the IDEA has the advantage of assuring the school district some additional funding for that student, though federal funding for the IDEA falls far short of the needs of most school districts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Obligations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The IDEA places numerous obligations upon schools to serve students with disabilities, and also provides numerous procedural safeguards to assure that schools execute their obligations in a timely and appropriate manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p>The IDEA requires schools to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of any student who may have a disability <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who is not succeeding in general education. The evaluation can be requested by any school professional, the parents of the child, or other providers involved in the child's care. Although the school can refuse to conduct an evaluation, refusal to conduct the evaluation has to be justified by data that shows that the evaluation is not needed.

(See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Procedural safeguards'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Americans with Disabilities Act</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a civil rights law and is an extension of Section 504 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80545 \">table 4</a>). It covers virtually all public entities in the United States, not just those receiving federal financial assistance; only private clubs and religious organizations are exempt from its regulations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>The main reason for listing the ADA in this topic review is that school professionals and lawyers sometimes speak of &quot;compliance with the ADA&quot; when discussing a student's needs at school. However, the ADA does not offer any additional protections to students with disabilities at school with respect to their access to an education. The ADA defers to the authority of Section 504 when the rights of students with disabilities are at issue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">VARIABILITY IN IMPLEMENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) , Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504), and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) require schools to provide qualifying students with specialized <span class=\"nowrap\">services/instruction</span> in order to benefit from their education and to participate fully at school. However, the manner in which services are delivered within school districts, between school districts, and across states is highly variable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3691098\"><span class=\"h2\">Variability due to local standards</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local student academic achievement and local professional standards have a significant impact upon which students are identified as needing services and what kinds of services are offered. As an example, a student with learning disability (LD) is more likely to be identified as such in a school with high academic standards than in a school with low academic standards. Some school districts identify only extremely impaired students as having learning disability, while other school districts also identify mildly impaired students. Specialized services and supports offered in one school district may be offered as part of general education services, whereas the same services may be offered only in special education in other school districts. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3691091\"><span class=\"h2\">Variability due to funding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another reason for the great variability in service delivery between school districts and across states is the issue of funding. The large majority of funding for all education, including special education, is borne by state and local governments. The federal government only funds approximately 10 percent of total education costs in the United States, of which a significant portion goes to funding the IDEA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. No specific funding is offered for compliance with Section 504 regulations. Federal funding offered by the IDEA covers approximately 18 percent of per-student special education costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Federal funding of the IDEA has never reached the 40 percent level that Congress originally authorized by law [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Only those schools with adequate funding can provide the full range of services intended by the IDEA to all of the students who may qualify. In some cases, inadequate funding interferes even with following procedural safeguards successfully. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">RESOURCES FOR FAMILIES</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wright P, Wright PD.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The definition and diagnostic criteria for LDs vary according to the source (eg, federal law, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, National Joint Commission on Learning Disabilities) and purpose (eg, determination of eligibility for special educational services). There is no universally accepted definition or set of diagnostic criteria. Definitions receiving the most support include the federal definition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56614\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56614 \">table 1</a>) and that proposed by the National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64300\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64300 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Educational definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three laws affect the education of students with disabilities and offer services to students who are having difficulty learning: Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68063\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68063 \">table 3</a>), and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Schools have broad latitude in providing specialized services and can justify providing services under any of the laws. Which students are identified as eligible for services is influenced by local student achievement, local professional standards, and funding. These factors are at least as influential as the dictates of the individual laws. (See <a href=\"#H467858238\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Educational services should be offered in general education (eg, as Response to Intervention services) before a decision is made to conduct a formal evaluation and determine eligibility for services under Section 504 or under the IDEA. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Every Student Succeeds Act'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The IDEA offers parents many procedural safeguards that require schools to evaluate the student for eligibility and to provide services when necessary. When uncertain about the school's responsiveness to the student's needs, the most secure route for accessing services is to obtain an evaluation to determine eligibility under the IDEA. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Individuals with Disabilities Education Act'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not all school districts have well-developed services for students who should be protected under Section 504 or under the IDEA.
