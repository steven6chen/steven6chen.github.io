When larger amounts of fluid accumulate (pericardial effusion) or when the pericardium becomes scarred and inelastic, one of three pericardial compressive syndromes may occur:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac tamponade &ndash; Cardiac tamponade, which may be acute or subacute, is characterized by the accumulation of pericardial fluid under pressure. Variants include low pressure (occult) and regional tamponade.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constrictive pericarditis &ndash; Constrictive pericarditis is the result of scarring and consequent loss of the normal elasticity of the pericardial sac. Pericardial constriction is typically chronic, but variants include subacute, transient, and occult constriction. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effusive-constrictive pericarditis &ndash; Effusive-constrictive pericarditis is characterized by underlying constrictive physiology with a coexisting pericardial effusion, often with cardiac tamponade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This usually results in a mixed hemodynamic picture with features of both constriction and tamponade. Such patients may be mistakenly thought to have only cardiac tamponade; however, elevation of the right atrial and pulmonary wedge pressures after drainage of the pericardial fluid points to the underlying constrictive process.</p><p/><p>In both typical constrictive pericarditis and effusive-constrictive pericarditis, cardiac filling is impeded by an external force. The normal pericardium can stretch to accommodate physiologic changes in cardiac volume. However, after its reserve volume is exceeded the pericardium markedly stiffens. In severe pericardial compressive syndromes, the pericardium becomes virtually inelastic, resulting in minimal ability to adapt to volume changes.</p><p>As a result, an important pathophysiologic feature of constrictive pericarditis is greatly enhanced ventricular interdependence, in which the hemodynamics of the left and right heart chambers are directly influenced by each other to a much greater degree than normal. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>The physiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of constrictive pericarditis and effusive-constrictive pericarditis will be reviewed here. Issues related to cardiac tamponade, and the evaluation and management of pericardial diseases that do not compromise hemodynamics, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pericardial effusion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H188581749\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with a normal pericardium, intrathoracic pressure decreases during inspiration, leading to an increase in venous return to the right heart and transient increase in right ventricular chamber size. Because the normal pericardium accommodates the increased venous return by expanding, this increase in venous return does not impair left ventricular filling. </p><p>In constrictive pericarditis the upper limit of cardiac volume is constrained by the inelastic pericardium. The thickened, rigid pericardium prevents the normal inspiratory decrease in intrathoracic pressure from being transmitted to the heart chambers. The abnormal pericardium also does not expand to accommodate increased venous return to the right heart during inspiration. Thus, pulmonary venous pressure, but not left ventricular pressure, declines during inspiration, leading to a reduction in left ventricular volume because of a decrease in the transpulmonary gradient. Because of ventricular interaction, the right heart volume expands via shifting of the interventricular septum. This interaction between the left and right ventricles is termed ventricular interdependence.</p><p>With constrictive pericarditis, early diastolic filling is even more rapid than normal. Compression does not occur until the cardiac volume approximates that of the pericardium, which begins in mid-diastole. As a result, virtually all ventricular filling occurs in early diastole with little or no filling subsequently. As constrictive pericarditis becomes more severe, ventricular volumes and stroke volumes are reduced.</p><p>The hemodynamic findings and distinction between constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy are discussed in more detail elsewhere.

The characteristics of the jugular venous waveforms in patients with constrictive pericarditis are different from those in normal patients and patients with other types of cardiac disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80995\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80995 \">figure 1</a>). The x and y troughs are more prominent than the a and v peaks and the inspiratory decline in venous pressure is confined to the depth of the y descent.

In addition, occult constrictive pericarditis has been described in patients who are volume depleted; in this setting, the increase in venous pressure may not be apparent prior to volume expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

While the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is often made by echocardiography, patients commonly undergo cardiac catheterization prior to surgical intervention. Invasive hemodynamic evaluation during cardiac catheterization can confirm the diagnosis and concurrent coronary angiography defines the patient&rsquo;s coronary anatomy prior to possible surgical intervention. In patients being evaluated for pericardiectomy, particularly those with prior radiation exposure, computed tomography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can provide additional detailed anatomic information about adjacent vascular structures and the extent of pericardial thickening, calcification, and scarring. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no pathognomonic electrocardiographic findings in constrictive pericarditis. Nonspecific ST and T wave changes and tachycardia are common, and low voltage may sometimes be present. In advanced cases, atrial fibrillation is common due to increased atrial pressures. In a series of 143 patients with surgically confirmed constrictive pericarditis, 22 percent had atrial fibrillation and 27 percent had low voltage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest radiograph</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of pericardial calcification by chest radiograph, especially in conjunction with the appropriate clinical presentation, is highly consistent with constrictive pericarditis.

Constrictive pericarditis is suggested in a patient with prior pericarditis or a systemic disease predisposing to constrictive pericarditis (eg, tuberculosis). Restrictive cardiomyopathy is more likely in a patient with a predisposing systemic disease such as diabetes mellitus or amyloidosis. A pericardial knock favors constrictive pericarditis, but is difficult to distinguish from the third heart sound of heart failure.

Increased thickness or calcification of the pericardium favors the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis, while myocardial thickening and abnormal myocardial texture suggest restrictive cardiomyopathy. Although increased pericardial thickness is a highly specific finding for the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis, it is not present in all patients. In one series of patients with surgically confirmed constrictive pericarditis, pericardial thickening was seen in only 37 percent by transthoracic echocardiogram and 72 percent by computed tomography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The most common cause of transient constrictive pericarditis was pericardial inflammation after pericardiotomy (25 percent of cases); infection (viral, bacterial, or tuberculous), idiopathic, collagen vascular disease, trauma, and malignancy accounted for the remaining cases. Treatment had included nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, steroids, antibiotics, chemotherapy, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors plus diuretics. Five patients had resolution of constriction without any specific therapy.</p><p>Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, specifically the degree of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) of the pericardium, appears promising as a way to predict which patients with constrictive pericarditis will have reversal or resolution of the process.

In one series, the 5- and 10-year survival rates were 78 and 57 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Independent adverse predictors of long-term outcome included older age and worse NYHA class. In other series, independent adverse predictors have included older age, renal dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dysfunction, left ventricular dysfunction, concomitant coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/6,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,55</a>].</p><p>The etiology of the pericardial disease is also an important determinant of survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. Prior ionizing radiation, because it may induce myocardial injury as well as pericardial disease, is associated with poorer long-term outcomes following surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In one series, the seven-year survival rates after surgery for patients with idiopathic, postsurgical, and radiation-induced constrictive pericarditis were 88, 66, and 27 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In two subsequent case series, the five-year survival rates after surgery for patients with idiopathic, postsurgical, and post-radiation constrictive pericarditis were 80, 56, and 11 percent, and 81, 50 and 0 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Preoperative indices of contraction and relaxation also predict postoperative prognosis. An observational study of 40 patients undergoing preoperative cardiac catheterization reported that patients with both an abnormal rate of left ventricular pressure decline (- LV <span class=\"nowrap\">dP/dt</span> &lt;1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmHg/s)</span> and an abnormal time constant of LV isovolumic relaxation (tau &gt;50 ms) required more frequent postoperative inotropic support, had higher immediate postoperative mortality, and significantly lower long-term survival (median follow-up 2.4 years) than patients with either two normal values or one abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Preoperative right ventricular systolic dysfunction also appears associated with postoperative morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">OCCULT CONSTRICTIVE PERICARDITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A report in 1977 described 19 patients with a syndrome called occult constrictive pericardial disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The symptom complex of this proposed syndrome was comprised of chest pain, dyspnea, and fatigue. Risk factors and examination findings consistent with constrictive pericarditis in this patient population included a history of acute pericarditis in 12 patients (which was recurrent in five), pericardial calcification in 2 patients, and nonspecific repolarization changes in 16 patients. A plausible cause for pericardial disease was present in 10. The authors proposed that very mild constrictive pericarditis can cause these symptoms in the absence of abnormal physical or hemodynamic findings when the patient is evaluated in the basal state. </p><p>To test this hypothesis, they measured hemodynamics invasively before and after infusing a liter or warm saline over a period of six to eight minutes to determine if occult constriction would then become overt. Six patients known not to have heart disease and 12 patients with myocardial disease served as controls.</p><p>The results can be summarized as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Saline infusion caused an elevation and equalization of ventricular filling pressures, and development of pressure waveforms in diastole characteristic of constrictive pericarditis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70708\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef70708 \">waveform 3</a>) in the patients presumed to have occult constriction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular filling pressures and diastolic waveform were unaltered in the subjects free from heart disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patients with myocardial disease developed elevated ventricular filling pressures, but unequally on the two sides.</p><p/><p>Eleven of the symptomatic patients underwent pericardiectomy with dramatic improvement. All 11 cases had mild gross or histologic evidence of pericardial disease. The fluid challenge was repeated postoperatively in five of the patients, with normal hemodynamic findings. </p><p>Despite these promising findings, little has subsequently been published on occult constrictive pericardial disease, and no additional case series or randomized studies have replicated these results. Even though the above study was conducted using high fidelity pressure tracings in a laboratory well known for high-quality hemodynamic studies, it is unclear why or how such mild constriction could cause disabling symptoms, or why chest pain was a feature. Furthermore, the dramatic relief by pericardiectomy is unexplained in these patients with normal venous pressures that were modestly elevated by a rapid fluid challenge, and in whom the cardiac output was normal at rest and was not changed by the infusion.</p><p>A saline infusion test looking for occult constrictive pericarditis is seldom indicated and, if performed, the results should not be the sole evidence leading to pericardiectomy. Patients suspected of having occult pericardial constrictive disease should undergo cardiac catheterization, including measurement of oxygen consumption during progressive bicycle exercise. A study of this nature would document exertional dyspnea and fatigue, and may help clarify the responsible mechanism. Rather than infusing fluid, diuretic therapy can be suspended for several days prior to cardiac catheterization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFUSIVE CONSTRICTIVE PERICARDITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pericardial cavity is typically obliterated in patients with constrictive pericarditis. Thus, even the normal amount of pericardial fluid is absent. However, pericardial effusion may be present in some cases. In this setting, the scarred pericardium not only constricts the cardiac volume but can also put pericardial fluid under increased pressure, leading to signs suggestive of cardiac tamponade. Pericardial pathology consistent with constrictive pericarditis with a concomitant effusion is called effusive constrictive pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/1,4,58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,58-60</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence and etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effusive constrictive pericarditis appears to be relatively uncommon, although there are only limited published data. In one series of 95 patients undergoing surgery for constrictive pericarditis, 24 percent were diagnosed with effusive constrictive pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In another series of 190 patients with cardiac tamponade who underwent pericardiocentesis and cardiac catheterization, effusive constrictive pericarditis was diagnosed in 15 patients (8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Most cases of effusive constrictive pericarditis are idiopathic, reflecting the frequency of idiopathic pericardial disease in general [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/4,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,59</a>]. Other reported causes include radiation, malignancy, chemotherapy, infection, and postsurgical pericardial disease. Tuberculosis is a frequent cause of effusive constrictive pericarditis in regions where tuberculosis is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In a series of 68 patients with tuberculous pericardial effusion, effusive-constrictive disease was present in just over half; compared with patients with pericardial effusion without constrictive physiology, pre-pericardiocentesis right atrial pressure and pericardial and serum IL-10 levels were higher among patients with effusive constrictive pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculous-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculous pericarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with effusive constrictive pericarditis usually present with clinical features of pericardial effusion or constrictive pericarditis or both.

In such cases, the right atrial pressure remains abnormal after removal of the pericardial effusion due to constriction by the visceral pericardium. Right heart pressures and systemic arterial blood pressure should be monitored simultaneously during elective pericardiocentesis in order to allow for the detection of effusive constrictive pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pericardial effusion&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Prior to pericardiocentesis, effusive constrictive pericarditis is suggested by the unexpected persistence of the v wave of right atrial pressure. The diagnosis is further supported by the following findings on the right atrial pressure tracing after pericardiocentesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistence of elevated right atrial pressure despite lowering of the pericardial pressure to near zero with pericardiocentesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The development of a marked, rapid y descent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lack of an inspiratory decline in right atrial pressure</p><p/><p>By definition, in patients with effusive constrictive pericarditis, pericardiocentesis fails to decrease the right atrial pressure by 50 percent or to a level below 10 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. A persistently elevated right atrial pressure after pericardiocentesis may also be due to right heart failure or tricuspid regurgitation. Thus, appropriate studies should be performed to exclude these disorders before making the diagnosis of effusive constrictive pericarditis. </p><p>Noninvasive imaging is not useful to confirm the diagnosis of effusive constrictive pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The visceral layer of pericardium, which is responsible for the constrictive component of this process, is not typically thickened to a degree that is detectable on imaging studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment and course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pericardiocentesis alone may produce at least temporary relief of symptoms in patients with effusive constrictive pericarditis, although it does not fully reverse the underlying condition. In a series of 15 patients, marked improvement after pericardiocentesis was noted in five, mild improvement in eight, and no benefit in two [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>In effusive constrictive pericarditis, it is mainly the visceral layer of pericardium, not the parietal layer, which constricts the heart. Thus, if surgery is required, a visceral pericardiectomy must be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. However, the visceral component of the pericardiectomy is often difficult, requiring sharp dissection of many small fragments until an improvement in ventricular motion is observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constrictive-pericarditis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Thus, pericardiectomy for effusive constrictive pericarditis should be performed only at centers with experience in pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2725712782\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Other important but less common features include pulsus paradoxus, Kussmaul&rsquo;s sign, a pericardial knock, edema, ascites, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cachexia. (See <a href=\"#H15913768\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with suspected constrictive pericarditis should undergo initial evaluation with electrocardiography, chest radiography, and echocardiography. (See <a href=\"#H274012956\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional testing is often required if the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis remains uncertain or if surgical intervention is planned. We suggest using CMR imaging in patients being considered for pericardiectomy to provide additional detailed anatomic information that might alter the decision to proceed with surgery based on the likelihood of resolution with medical therapy alone. Computed tomography (CT) can provide additional detailed anatomic information about the extent of pericardial thickening and scarring. Invasive hemodynamic evaluation during cardiac catheterization can confirm the diagnosis and concurrent coronary angiography defines the patient&rsquo;s coronary anatomy prior to possible surgical intervention. (See <a href=\"#H274012956\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common findings on imaging studies include pericardial thickening with or without calcification, dilatation of the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins (plethora) with absent or diminished inspiratory collapse, abnormal passive filling of the ventricles during early diastole, and pronounced respiratory variation in ventricular filling. (See <a href=\"#H274012956\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The symptoms and physical findings in patients with constrictive pericarditis are similar to those of several other disorders. Most importantly, the clinician must distinguish between constrictive pericarditis, which is treated by pericardiectomy; cardiac tamponade, which is treated by drainage of the pericardial effusion; and disorders such as restrictive cardiomyopathy and cirrhosis, which require markedly different treatment. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with newly diagnosed constrictive pericarditis who are hemodynamically stable and without evidence of chronic constriction (ie, no evidence of cachexia, weight loss, reduced cardiac output at rest, or hypoalbuminemia due to protein losing enteropathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impaired hepatic function due to chronic congestion or cardiogenic cirrhosis), we suggest a trial of conservative management rather than pericardiectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

Medical therapy (ie, diuretics) may be used as a temporizing measure and for patients who are not candidates for surgery. While the majority of patients have a significant improvement in symptoms following pericardiectomy, there is a significant perioperative morbidity and mortality.
