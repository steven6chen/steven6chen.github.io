Studies of asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction have used heterogeneous criteria to identify this condition. For the discussion in this topic, ALVSD is defined as depressed LV systolic function with a subnormal LV ejection fraction, regional wall motion abnormality, or both. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-asymptomatic-left-ventricular-systolic-dysfunction#H4034210288\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Definition'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Population-based studies suggest that ALVSD is at least as common as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Asymptomatic LV dysfunction is a risk factor for progression to HF and death. Structural heart disease (including LV systolic dysfunction) without symptoms or signs of HF is defined as &quot;stage B HF&quot; in the American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">Foundation/American</span> Heart Association guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-asymptomatic-left-ventricular-systolic-dysfunction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The evaluation and management of patients with asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction will be reviewed here. Issues related to the management of HFrEF are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1063218009\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ALVSD) with reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF) have American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association stage B heart failure (HF), meaning they are at increased risk for clinical (ie, stage C or D) HF and death (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F60648\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60648 \">figure 1</a>). This risk was demonstrated by a meta-analysis including 10 reports with a total of 24,206 individuals with ASLVD followed for an average of approximately eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-asymptomatic-left-ventricular-systolic-dysfunction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The absolute risk of progression to HF was 8.4 per 100 person-years for those with ALVSD, as compared with 1 per 100 person-years in individuals without any ventricular dysfunction. The combined maximally adjusted relative risk of HF for ALVSD was 4.6. Based upon data from four studies that reported risk of HF per unit change in LVEF, the combined maximally adjusted relative risk of HF per 1 standard deviation lower EF was 1.4. </p><p>The following two studies were among those included in the meta-analysis: &#160; &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the SOLVD trial, individuals with asymptomatic LV dysfunction treated with placebo progressed to symptomatic HF at a rate of 9.7 percent per year and the three-year mortality rate was 15.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-asymptomatic-left-ventricular-systolic-dysfunction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> arm, symptomatic HF developed at a significantly lower rate of 6.7 percent per year but the mortality rate of 14.8 was not significantly lower than that in the placebo arm.

During nine-year follow-up, these individuals were at increased risk for incident HF (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 8.69; 4.89 to 15.45), cardiovascular disease (adjusted HR 2.21; 1.13 to 3.73), and mortality (adjusted HR 2; 1.13 to 3.54). </p><p/><p>Similarly, asymptomatic individuals with regional wall motion abnormalities are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as illustrated by an analysis from the Strong Heart Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-asymptomatic-left-ventricular-systolic-dysfunction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. During eight-year follow-up, presence of baseline regional wall motion abnormalities was associated with 2.5-fold higher risk of cardiovascular events and 2.6-fold higher risk of cardiovascular death, after adjustment for other risk factors.

We recommend echocardiographic assessment when symptoms of HF appear in patients with prior ALVSD. In addition, some experts suggest follow-up echocardiographic evaluation at approximately one year in patients with newly diagnosed ALVSD who remain asymptomatic. The frequency of subsequent monitoring is determined by the stability of LVEF in the past, and the likelihood that a change in LVEF will lead to a change in therapy. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1709290076\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY OF NEUROHORMONAL BLOCKADE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic LV systolic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and possibly beta blockers appear to be beneficial in patients with asymptomatic chronic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ASLVD). Treatment recommendations for ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with chronic LV systolic dysfunction due to coronary disease or cardiomyopathy are largely based upon the SOLVD prevention trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-asymptomatic-left-ventricular-systolic-dysfunction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The SOLVD prevention trial consisted of 4228 asymptomatic patients (83 percent had had a myocardial infarction [MI] more than 30 days from entry) with an LV ejection fraction (LVEF) &le;35 percent; the patients were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> (20 mg once per day) or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-asymptomatic-left-ventricular-systolic-dysfunction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. At a mean follow-up of just over three years, enalapril therapy was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in cardiovascular mortality compared with placebo (14 versus 16 percent) and a significant 29 percent reduction (95% CI 21-36) in the combined incidence of symptomatic heart failure (HF) or cardiovascular death (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75136\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75136 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p>A subsequent analysis, called XSOLVD, evaluated virtually all of the original participants in the SOLVD prevention trial at a median of 11 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-asymptomatic-left-ventricular-systolic-dysfunction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

In contrast to the 30 percent incidence of death or symptomatic HF in patients with ASLVD with an ACE inhibitor in the SOLVD prevention trial, the SOLVD treatment trial showed that, although ACE inhibitors were beneficial in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II to III HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 1</a>), the mortality rate alone was 20 percent at two years with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> compared with 25 percent with placebo (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70015\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70015 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-asymptomatic-left-ventricular-systolic-dysfunction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].
