Although sodium can be consumed in nonchloride forms (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> [ie, baking soda] and monosodium glutamate [MSG]), salt provides approximately 90 percent of dietary sodium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the United States, the quantity of sodium is typically reported as milligrams or millimoles of sodium, whereas in other parts of the world, in the scientific literature, and in recommendations, the quantity of sodium is reported as grams of salt (sodium chloride) rather than as sodium alone (to convert between units: grams of salt x 393 = milligrams of sodium; millimoles of sodium x 23 = milligrams of sodium).</p><p>Sodium is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and functions as the osmotic determinant in regulating extracellular fluid volume and, therefore, plasma volume. Approximately 95 percent of the total sodium content of the body is found in extracellular fluid. Sodium is also an important determinant of the membrane potential of cells and the active transport of molecules across cell membranes. The concentration of sodium within the cell is typically less than 10 percent of that outside cell membranes, and an active, energy-dependent process is required to maintain this concentration gradient.</p><p>The relationship between sodium intake and blood pressure (BP), as well as the effects of sodium reduction in patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension (formerly called &quot;essential&quot; hypertension), are discussed in this topic review.</p><p>The importance of a reduced sodium intake, as well as fluid removal with diuretics, for volume management BP control in patients with chronic kidney disease is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-acute-and-chronic-kidney-disease#H17855216\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in acute and chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Benefits of sodium restriction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Importance of salt intake'</a>.)</p><p>The relationship of other factors to the development of hypertension, the evaluation of the hypertensive patient, and the management of hypertension in general and in specific subpopulations are discussed elsewhere.

The ability of humans to survive at extremely low levels of sodium intake reflects the capacity of the normal human body to conserve sodium by markedly reducing losses of sodium in the urine and sweat. In a steady state, the minimal amount of sodium required to replace losses is estimated to be 180 mg (8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol)/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Based upon data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) study, estimated average sodium intake in United States adults remains high, approximately 3600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and exceeds both the recommended upper limit of 2300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> set by the 2015 United States Dietary Guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and the more stringent limit of 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> set by the American Heart Association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Average intake is approximately 4200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in men and approximately 3000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in women. The greater consumption of sodium in men compared with women results largely from the fact that sodium intake is highly correlated with total food intake, and men consume substantially more than women, especially in young and middle-age years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F112187\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112187 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>While many people enjoy the taste of salt, the taste for salt is malleable and decreases as people are gradually exposed to a lower-sodium diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Because of its ubiquity in the food supply, even motivated consumers find it difficult to reduce their salt intake. Approximately 80 percent of sodium intake in the United States comes from restaurant and packaged food, while a substantially smaller amount comes from discretionary sources (ie, added by individuals during meals and food preparation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60316\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60316 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2475714258\"><span class=\"h1\">SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE FOR DIETARY SODIUM REDUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood pressure (BP)-related diseases (eg, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and end-stage renal disease [ESRD]) are leading causes of morbidity and mortality throughout the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The risk of BP-related diseases increases progressively throughout the range of BP, including both the nonhypertensive and hypertensive ranges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. An estimated 47 percent of coronary heart disease events and 54 percent of strokes can be attributed to elevated BP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A fundamental aspect of the elevated BP epidemic is the age-related rise in BP in both children and adults.</p><p>The level of BP in an individual and, more broadly, in a population reflects a combination of multiple influences: genetic factors that raise BP and others that lower BP, environmental factors (eg, diet, weight), physiologic characteristics (eg, age), and clinical factors (eg, kidney function). Of these, diet, including sodium intake, is one of the few determinants of BP that individuals can modify.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1509939731\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of sodium on blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excess sodium intake has an important, if not predominant, role in the pathogenesis of elevated BP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Supportive evidence comes from animal studies, migration studies, ecologic studies, longitudinal observational studies, clinical trials, meta-analyses of trials, and genetic studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-factors-in-the-pathogenesis-of-hypertension#H941799816\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic factors in the pathogenesis of hypertension&quot;, section on 'Monogenic (secondary) hypertension'</a>.)</p><p>Dietary sodium reduction lowers BP in nonhypertensive and hypertensive individuals, across the lifespan from children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] to older-aged persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Over 100 trials have examined the relationship between sodium intake and BP. The best available evidence strongly indicates a direct relationship between sodium intake and elevated BP; on average, as sodium intake is reduced, BP is also reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In general, the magnitude of the BP reduction as a result of reduced sodium intake is greater in blacks, middle- and older-aged persons, individuals with hypertension, and, likely, also in those with diabetes or kidney disease. Although BP reductions observed in children and nonhypertensive adults in response to sodium reduction are small, the best available evidence suggests that a reduced sodium intake can delay and potentially prevent the onset of hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and, thereby, potentially reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1908725031\" class=\"local\">'Effects of sodium on cardiovascular disease'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, dietary sodium reduction also blunts the age-related rise in BP. Because BP rises with age, approximately 90 percent of adults eventually become hypertensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Numerous studies, including the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium trial have demonstrated that sodium reduction lowers BP more in older adults than in younger adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. As an example, in persons without hypertension, BP decreased by 7.0 mmHg in those &gt;45 years of age compared with 3.7 mmHg in those &le;45 years of age. These results indicate that dietary sodium reduction has the potential to lessen the rise in BP with age and also confirm the well-documented observation that members of isolated populations who consume a low-sodium diet have a smaller age-related rise in BP than those in populations with higher sodium intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H839356514\"><span class=\"h3\">Variability in the blood pressure response to sodium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The BP response to a change in salt (sodium chloride) intake is heterogeneous. &quot;Salt sensitivity&quot; is the term that has been applied to this quantitative (ie, continuous) trait. Those persons who exhibit the largest rise in BP in response to increased sodium intake have been termed &quot;salt sensitive&quot; (SS), while those who exhibit little or no BP change have been termed &quot;salt resistant&quot; (SR). Defining an individual as SS or SR depends upon the use of arbitrarily chosen cutoffs for the magnitude of the BP change as well as the magnitude of the change in sodium, and there is no widely accepted threshold that denotes SS. Using a large cutoff for the BP change (eg, a systolic BP increase of &gt;10 mmHg) will lead to few persons being classified as SS; by contrast, using a small threshold (eg, a systolic BP increase of &gt;0 mmHg) will lead to a substantial fraction of persons being classified as SS.</p><p>The heterogeneous BP response to an increased sodium intake may reflect true biological differences among individuals, random variability and imprecision of BP measurements, or both. BP measurements in an individual in a steady state are highly variable, and, therefore, many of the observed differences in BP response to sodium likely represent random variation (ie, measurement error). However, many studies, mostly performed in rodents, suggest that true underlying biological differences are also likely to contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Most genetic abnormalities detected to date in SS hypertensive rodents relate to the regulation of natriuresis. Indeed, most mechanistic studies have implicated subclinical kidney dysfunction, particularly renal handing of sodium excretion, as one cause of salt sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, other pathways, including regulation of regional blood flows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], cutaneous sodium storage, and innate immunity, are emerging, in large part from research using modern techniques of genetic investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].</p><p>Human studies suggest that age, race-ethnicity, gender, adiposity, and certain clinical conditions (hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease) might influence the BP response to salt. For several of these factors, evidence is insufficient to draw strong conclusions because the effects of salt reduction were not simultaneously evaluated in a comparator group. As an example, some trials tested the BP effects of salt reduction in patients with diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], yet none tested the effects concurrently in patients without diabetes. Also, most meta-analyses aggregate published data across studies rather than analyzing individual-level data; such studies are poorly suited to identify subgroups that are SS. By contrast, some studies, such as the DASH-Sodium trial, have simultaneously examined the effects of salt in both genders, in blacks and whites, by age, and over a broad range of baseline BP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/18,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,27,28</a>].</p><p>In aggregate, a strong and consistent body of evidence has documented the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Black individuals have a greater BP response to a change in sodium intake compared with white individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/27,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertensives have a greater BP reduction in response to a decrease in sodium intake compared with nonhypertensives; in addition, the BP response to sodium reduction is substantially greater in patients with medication-resistant hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/27,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,30</a>]. The table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F112177\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112177 \">table 1</a>) displays the joint effects of sodium reduction by race (African American and non-African American) and hypertensive status (stage 1 and prehypertension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], along with the effects of sodium reduction in patients with resistant hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older-aged persons have a greater BP response than younger adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, children also experience a decrease in BP from sodium reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effects of sodium reduction depend upon other dietary factors. The effects of sodium reduction on BP are greater in the setting of a low potassium intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] and in the setting of a typical American diet compared with the DASH-style diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p>Less consistent evidence suggests that women might be more SS than men and that overweight persons are more SS than normal-weight persons. Few trials have tested the effects of salt reduction on BP in Asian populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>] and in persons with diabetes or chronic kidney disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4212048726\"><span class=\"h3\">Response to antihypertensive drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to its direct effect on BP, lowering the extracellular volume by limiting sodium intake can enhance the response to most antihypertensive drugs, except possibly calcium channel blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Sodium reduction may also diminish the degree of potassium depletion following treatment with a diuretic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Dietary sodium reduction, by increasing renin release, makes the BP more dependent upon angiotensin II and, therefore, more responsive to therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. A less responsive renin-angiotensin system may be one reason why blacks appear to be more sensitive to sodium reduction than whites. Even patients being treated with the combination of a diuretic and an ACE inhibitor benefit from a reduction in sodium intake (eg, from 195 to 105 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day);</span> in this setting, mean BP fell by an average of <span class=\"nowrap\">9/3</span> mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Several trials have documented that sodium reduction lowers urinary protein excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In patients with proteinuric chronic kidney disease who are already treated with ACE inhibitors, reducing sodium intake substantially decreases both BP and proteinuria to a degree greater than that achieved by addition of an ARB to the ACE inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

This may be due to natriuresis that occurs after initiation of a calcium channel blocker, similar to that seen with a diuretic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. A natriuretic effect of calcium channel blockade may appear surprising in view of the common complication of peripheral edema in patients treated with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. However, the edema in this setting results from redistribution of fluid from the vascular space into the interstitium rather than renal sodium retention.

In the largest and longest of these trials, those assigned to a reduced sodium intervention had a 25 to 30 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Many observational studies have examined the relationship of sodium intake or sodium excretion with cardiovascular disease, and most found that a high sodium intake increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In some observational studies, both high sodium intake and low sodium intake (or excretion) were associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (ie, a U- or J-shaped relationship was observed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. However, such paradoxical findings likely resulted from methodologic limitations, such as the use of a single spot urine collection (rather than multiple 24-hour collections) to estimate an individual's usual sodium intake and the possibility that individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease choose to reduce their sodium intake (ie, reverse causation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>The assessment of sodium intake is fraught with methodologic challenges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Both systematic and random errors in the measurement of dietary sodium intake are commonplace. The gold standard remains measurement of urinary sodium excretion from multiple high-quality, 24-hour collections, but even these estimates can be inaccurate because of collection problems (most commonly, undercollection). In addition, because of large day-to-day, within-person variation, repeat measurements on multiple days are needed to obtain precise estimates of an individual's usual intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].

The last two disorders reflect the direct relationship of sodium intake with urinary calcium excretion; as sodium intake increases, so does calciuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent calcium stones in adults&quot;, section on 'Limit sodium intake'</a>).

Even though extreme sodium reduction to &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day</span> might adversely affect insulin resistance and blood lipids, moderate sodium reduction has no such effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Potential adverse effects of a reduced sodium intake are increases in uric acid and plasma renin activity (PRA). However, the clinical relevance of modest rises in uric acid and PRA as a result of sodium reduction and other antihypertensive therapies is unclear. In fact, thiazide-like diuretics, a class of antihypertensive drug therapies that raises uric acid and PRA, significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H232667118\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A low-salt diet is recommended in all international and national guidelines as a component of nonpharmacologic therapy of primary hypertension (formerly called &quot;essential&quot; hypertension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2396155834\"><span class=\"h2\">Major society recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost all national and international organizations recommend dietary sodium reduction as part of the nonpharmacologic therapy for hypertension.

A brief supportive message on the benefits of sodium reduction, even without extensive counseling, should be beneficial. Still, reducing sodium intake requires behavioral change. Accordingly, provision of pamphlets, while useful in identifying foods with high amounts of sodium, is an incomplete approach. Counseling from a skilled dietitian or health educator, coupled with tracking of sodium intake, is often required to accomplish meaningful reductions in sodium intake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F112175\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112175 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

(See <a href=\"#H3437238996\" class=\"local\">'Sodium intake in the population'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary sodium reduction can lower BP in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, prevent hypertension, and enhance the BP response to most antihypertensive therapies (see <a href=\"#H1509939731\" class=\"local\">'Effect of sodium on blood pressure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4212048726\" class=\"local\">'Response to antihypertensive drugs'</a> above). In general, the extent of BP reduction as a result of reduced sodium intake is greater in blacks, middle- and older-aged persons, individuals with hypertension, and, likely, patients with diabetes or kidney disease. (See <a href=\"#H839356514\" class=\"local\">'Variability in the blood pressure response to sodium'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary sodium reduction should decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease through its effects on BP and other effects that are independent of BP. (See <a href=\"#H1908725031\" class=\"local\">'Effects of sodium on cardiovascular disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In hypertensive individuals, we recommend reducing dietary sodium intake (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). A reasonable goal is to reduce daily sodium intake to &lt;100 mEq (2.3 g of sodium or 6 g of sodium <span class=\"nowrap\">chloride)/day</span>. Further reduction to approximately 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day</span> has an even greater effect on BP but is difficult to achieve given the prevailing food supply. (See <a href=\"#H232667118\" class=\"local\">'Clinical recommendations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In persons without hypertension, we also recommend reducing dietary sodium intake to the same level (&lt;100 mEq [2.3 g of sodium or 6 g of sodium <span class=\"nowrap\">chloride]/day)</span> with the goal of preventing hypertension and decreasing the risk of stroke and other cardiovascular events (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
