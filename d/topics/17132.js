The most frequent are biliary tract strictures, bile leaks, and bile duct stones. The estimated incidence of these complications ranges between 10 and 25 percent in various reports, although rates have been decreasing over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. Most can be managed successfully with endoscopic retrograde cholangiography if there is a duct-to-duct anastomosis.</p><p>This topic review focuses on the various biliary complications after LT and their endoscopic management. Reviews of other complications following liver transplantation are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation in adults: Long-term management of transplant recipients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious complications in liver transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biliary complications (bile duct strictures, leaks, and stones) following LT can be categorized as early (within four weeks) or late [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Biliary strictures can be further divided into anastomotic, nonanastomotic, and diffuse intrahepatic strictures. Other complications such as bile casts, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, mucocele, and hemobilia are rare and most also can be managed endoscopically (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75116\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75116 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several risk factors for the development of biliary complications after LT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50456 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some studies have suggested that a major risk factor is the type of biliary reconstruction (duct-to-duct choledochocholedochostomy versus Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy), but it is generally agreed that the rate of complications is similar (or only marginally higher) with the Roux-en-Y technique compared with choledochocholedochostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/2,9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9-12</a>]. Duct-to-duct anastomosis of the common bile duct has the advantage of easy access to the biliary system and preservation of the sphincter of Oddi, which in theory avoids reflux of contents into the bile duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comparative studies between post-LT patients with and without T-tubes indicate that routine T-tube placement is associated with a higher incidence of biliary complications including strictures, bile leaks, and cholangitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. T-tubes previously were placed routinely after liver transplantation, but their role is much less apparent with more effective use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiography.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for the development of biliary complications after LT (particularly strictures) are acute hepatic artery thrombosis, hepatic artery stenosis, bile leak, technical factors during surgery (excessive dissection of periductal tissue during procurement, excessive use of electrocautery for biliary duct bleeding control in both donor and recipient, and tension of the duct anastomosis), small caliber of the bile duct and mismatched size between donor and recipient bile ducts, <span class=\"nowrap\">ischemia/reperfusion</span> injury, pre-LT diagnosis of cytomegalovirus infection, donation after cardiac death, ABO blood group mismatch, older age of donor, prolonged cold and warm ischemia times, and primary sclerosing cholangitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50456 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/8,13,19-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13,19-32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A biliary complication is usually first suspected in asymptomatic LT recipients who have elevations of serum aminotransferases, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gamma-glutamyl transferase levels. Occasionally, patients have nonspecific symptoms (such as fever and anorexia), right upper quadrant abdominal pain (especially with bile leaks), pruritus, jaundice, and bile ascites. Exposure of the peritoneum and other visceral structures to bile usually results in abdominal pain. However, pain may be absent in the transplant setting because of immunosuppression and hepatic denervation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/8,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12,13</a>].</p><p>The initial evaluation should include liver ultrasound (US) with a Doppler evaluation of the hepatic vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56381\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef56381 \">algorithm 1</a>). If hepatic artery stenosis or occlusion is suspected by Doppler US, a computed tomographic angiogram should be obtained or hepatic angiography performed before obtaining other tests.</p><p>Liver biopsy is often performed to exclude rejection, although it is generally deferred in patients with biliary dilation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of common bile duct stones because of the risk of causing a bile leak. In addition, histologic features of bile duct obstruction can sometimes be misleading and confused with rejection or recurrent hepatitis C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Thus, correlation of histologic findings with results of imaging tests is important. Unfortunately, abdominal US may not be sufficiently sensitive (sensitivity 38 to 66 percent) to detect biliary obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/26,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,34</a>]. Thus, the absence of bile duct dilation on US should not preclude further evaluation with more sensitive techniques (see below) in patients in whom there is clinical suspicion of biliary tract complications.</p><p>If there is a strong clinical suspicion and an US that indicates a bile duct obstruction with or without stones or a bile leak, a cholangiogram should be obtained, as it is considered the reference standard for the diagnosis of biliary tract complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/3-6,8,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6,8,12,13</a>]. Although endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) remains the gold standard, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) has gained increasing acceptance as a reliable technique in detecting biliary complications after LT. A meta-analysis found that MRCP had a sensitivity of 96 percent and a specificity of 94 percent for diagnosing biliary obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. MRCP is currently considered an optimal noninvasive diagnostic tool for the assessment of biliary complications after LT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53402\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53402 \">picture 1</a>), especially if the abdominal US is normal and there is a high suspicion of a biliary complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-indications-patient-preparation-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography: Indications, patient preparation, and complications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=percutaneous-transhepatic-cholangiography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We generally start with an MRCP before embarking on more invasive procedures. This is particularly true when ERC <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PTC cannot be performed or there is a low probability that intervention will be required. One trial found that performing an ERC only when there was evidence of a bile duct obstruction or leak on imaging studies, laboratory tests, or liver biopsy led to a high-yield study (ie, one in which a clinically important intervention was carried out) in 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, the trial also found that proceeding with a diagnostic ERC without detailed imaging (ie, MRCP) was an acceptable clinical strategy for LT recipients because there still was a high likelihood of a high-yield study (66 percent) and the rate of serious complications was low.</p><p>In those in whom an invasive approach (ie, ERC or PTC) is required, we consider the type of biliary reconstruction, the likelihood of therapeutic intervention, and the available expertise. In our experience, ERC is perhaps the best <span class=\"nowrap\">diagnostic/therapeutic</span> intervention in patients with duct-to-duct anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. We generally reserve PTC for patients in whom ERC was unsuccessful and in patients with a Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy. In high-volume centers with experienced endoscopists, ERC can be successfully performed in patients with a Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy with a variable stiffness pediatric colonoscope or with deep small bowel enteroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>].

The incidence in various reports ranges between 4 and 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/1-6,8,12,13,26,41-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6,8,12,13,26,41-44</a>], with higher incidence rates seen in reports with longer follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Strictures that occur early after LT are due mostly to technical problems, whereas late strictures are mainly due to vascular insufficiency, ischemia, and problems with healing and fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/13,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,45</a>]. Bile leak is an independent risk factor for the development of anastomotic strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/28,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,31</a>].</p><p>Strictures can occur with either type of biliary anastomosis, although in at least two series, strictures were more common with Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/2,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,46</a>].</p><p>Strictures are classified as anastomotic or nonanastomotic, depending upon the stricture site. These two types of strictures differ in presentation, outcome, and response to therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H148027761\"><span class=\"h2\">Anastomotic strictures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of anastomotic strictures (AS) occur within the first 12 months after LT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50820%7EGAST%2F63968%7EGAST%2F58463\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50820 graphicRef63968 graphicRef58463 \">image 1A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. AS identified within six months after LT usually have a good response to short-term stenting (three to six months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, patients require long-term surveillance since strictures often recur. In an illustrative study, patients who developed biliary strictures after LT and who initially were treated endoscopically with balloon dilation and plastic stents had a recurrence rate of 18 percent with a mean time to recurrence of 3.7 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In a second study, the recurrence rate following endoscopic treatment was 34 percent, with a mean time to recurrence of 14.5 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>The characteristic cholangiographic appearance of an AS is that of a thin narrowing in the area of the biliary anastomosis. In some patients, a transient narrowing of the anastomosis may become evident within the first one to two months after LT due to postoperative edema and inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This type of narrowing responds to endoscopic balloon dilation and plastic stent placement; in the majority of patients, it will resolve within three months and the anastomosis will remain patent without further intervention.</p><p>Except for the subset with this early narrowing, most patients with an AS require ongoing ERC sessions (every three months) with balloon dilation and long-term stenting (for 12 to 24 months). We place a guidewire across the stricture, dilate using balloon diameters of 6 to 8 mm, and then place 7 to 11.5 Fr plastic stents with increasing diameter and number if possible. This approach was more effective than balloon dilation alone in a study of 24 patients with AS after LT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Stents are exchanged at three-month intervals to avoid stent occlusion and bacterial cholangitis. </p><p>Most patients require several endoscopic interventions (mean of three to five) with long-term success rates in the range of 65 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/3,43,44,47,49-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,43,44,47,49-59</a>]. Because of these high success rates, we suggest that endoscopic management be considered before considering percutaneous interventions or surgical repair in patients with duct-to-duct anastomosis.</p><p>Increasing the number of stents placed may improve success rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In a study of 83 patients with AS who were stented for a minimum of one year, up to nine 8.5 to 11.5 Fr stents were placed per ERC. ERC was repeated at three-month intervals if only one or two stents remained, or after one year if three or more stents were in place. In addition, ERC was repeated in all patients who demonstrated signs of biliary obstruction. At the end of the study, 69 patients had reached a study endpoint (AS resolution or hepaticojejunostomy). AS resolution occurred in 65 patients (94 percent), and 4 patients (6 percent) required a hepaticojejunostomy. Treatment success was associated with the total number of stents placed (mean 8.0 versus 3.5 for those who failed treatment) and the number of stents placed per ERC (mean 2.5 versus 1.3). After a median follow-up of 11 months, only two patients (3 percent) who had been successfully treated required repeat ERC for recurrent AS. </p><p>Another analysis from Italy found that among 56 patients at a large academic hospital who underwent ERC for LT-related&nbsp;biliary complications&nbsp;between July 1994 and March 2012, resolution of AS was seen in 50 out of 51 patients (98 percent), and mean duration of endoscopic treatment was 11.5 months, with a median of four ERCs per patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Immediate ERC-related adverse events occurred in 3 of 56 patients (5.4&#8202; percent). After a median follow-up of 5.8 years from stent removal, 3 out of 50 patients (6&#8202; percent) had recurrence of AS. &#8202;All three were successfully treated again endoscopically and were asymptomatic after a further median follow-up of 5.6 years.</p><p>There is some clinical experience in temporary (approximately 3 to 12 months) placement of covered self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) to reduce the need for repeated stent exchanges, but data are limited. In a systematic review that included 200 patients treated with SEMS, stricture resolution rates of 80 to 95 percent were seen when the stent duration was three months or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. However, the stent migration rate was 16 percent. By comparison, the stricture resolution rate was 94 to 100 percent for patients who were treated with plastic stents for 12 months or more. A more recent multicenter prospective study that included 187 patients with benign strictures analyzed the role of fully covered SEMS. In the study, 42 liver transplantation recipients with AS were treated with fully covered SEMS. There was a resolution rate of only 68 percent with a significant complication rate (38 percent), mainly due to cholangitis. Finally, a randomized trial with 112 patients with benign biliary strictures (from liver transplantation, chronic pancreatitis, or other postoperative injury) found a resolution rate by 12 months of 93 percent with SEMS and 85 percent for plastic stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Stricture recurrence was seen in 14 percent of the patients treated with SEMS and 5 percent of patients treated with plastic stents. However, in the subgroup of 73 patients with biliary strictures after liver transplantation, there was no difference in stricture resolution rates (95 percent each) or number of days (371 cSEMS versus 367 plastic) to resolution among both groups. Currently, there are not enough data to support the systematic use of SEMS over plastic stents in the treatment of AS. The use of SEMS may be beneficial in patients who fail therapy with plastic stents and dilatation; however, data are scarce, and migration rates in this setting are also high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>In 4 to 17 percent of cases, ERC cannot be successfully performed due to failure to traverse the AS with a guidewire, which precludes further therapy with dilatation and stent placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/44,50,52,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,50,52,64,65</a>]. Previous bile leaks and high blood transfusion requirements during surgery are risk factors for initial ERC failure in LT recipients with AS. The majority of these patients will need surgery for definitive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. In patients with Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy, ERC is often unsuccessful. In such patients, we suggest management with ERC with small bowel enteroscopy in centers with experience or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) and dilation, followed by placement of a percutaneous transhepatic catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ercp-in-patients-with-roux-en-y-anatomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ERCP in patients with Roux-en-Y anatomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Surgical revision (usually a repair or conversion to a Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy) may be an alternative in stable patients with a duct-to-duct stricture that is difficult to treat. An advantage of surgery is that it eliminates the need for multiple procedures.</p><p>As noted above, patients with bile duct strictures, irrespective of their nature, require lifelong surveillance since strictures tend to recur. The recurrence of AS is high among those patients with an initial delayed presentation (&gt;6 months) and very tight strictures. We monitor patients with periodic evaluation of liver enzymes, liver US, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, depending upon the nature and duration of the stricture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H148028645\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonanastomotic strictures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonanastomotic strictures (NAS) result mainly from hepatic artery thrombosis or other forms of ischemia. Less commonly, they can be due to recurrence of the underlying disease such as primary sclerosing cholangitis. They account for 10 to 25 percent of all stricture complications after LT, with an incidence in the range of 0.5 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/2,6,10,42,43,68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,10,42,43,68,69</a>]. Impaired blood supply as a result of vascular ischemia may cause injury to the peribiliary glands and vascular plexus. Damage to these structures is associated with the development of NAS after&nbsp;transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>NAS can occur proximal to the anastomosis in the extra- or intrahepatic bile duct. There may be multiple strictures involving the hilum and intrahepatic ducts, causing a cholangiographic appearance that resembles primary sclerosing cholangitis. Biliary sludge can accumulate proximal to the strictures, leading to the formation of casts (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Casts'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. This may predispose the patient to develop recurrent episodes of cholangitis. NAS tend to occur earlier than AS, with a mean time to stricture development of three to six months, though they can occur up to one year following LT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/43,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,68</a>].</p><p>NAS are more difficult to treat than AS. Endoscopic therapy of NAS typically consists of 4 to 6 mm balloon dilation (compared with 6 to 8 mm for AS) followed by sphincterotomy and placement of 10 to 11.5 Fr plastic stents with replacement every three months, similar to the management of AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, time to response with NAS is more prolonged than with AS. In an illustrative study, the median time of response was 185 days for NAS versus 67 days for AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>The outcomes of NAS are not as favorable as AS.

As a general rule, ischemic events that lead to diffuse intrahepatic bile duct strictures are associated with poor graft survival and in most instances will require retransplantation in suitable candidates.</p><p>One of the largest series included 81 patients with NAS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Most strictures were in the extrahepatic bile duct. Approximately one-third of the patients underwent interventional treatment (ERC, PTC, or surgery). Treatment was associated with improvement in liver enzymes, but nearly two-thirds of the patients had radiological progression despite the improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Progression of NAS was more common in patients with early NAS and one or more episodes of bacterial cholangitis (which were more common in those with Roux-en-Y anatomy). Advanced fibrosis developed in 28 percent of patients. Although graft survival was compromised (73 percent at five years), patient survival was not affected. Thirteen patients (16 percent) were retransplanted.</p><p>Surgical revision may ultimately be required in patients with strictures that are refractory to endoscopic or percutaneous treatment. A Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy is usually performed in patients with duct-to-duct anastomosis. In those who already have a Roux-en-Y anastomosis, repositioning the bile duct of the graft to a better vascularized area may be required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">BILE LEAKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bile leaks occur following LT with an incidence that ranges between 2 and 25 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82625\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82625 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/1-6,8,41,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6,8,41,72</a>]. The presence of a bile leak is an independent risk factor for the development of early or late strictures and requires prompt therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Leakage can occur from the anastomosis, the cystic duct, the T-tube tract, or (in the case of living donor or split liver LT) from the cut surface of the liver. Many bile leaks can be resolved nonoperatively with early intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/1-6,8,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6,8,41</a>].</p><p>Bile leaks can be divided into early and late events.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Early bile leaks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early bile leaks usually occur at the anastomotic site and are often related to technical issues, not to the type of biliary reconstruction. Factors that predispose grafts to early bile leaks include lack of perfusion from the hepatic artery and other technical reasons. Bile leaks are suspected in patients with peritonitis or fluid collections seen on imaging tests. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>In cases where a T-tube is in place, small anastomotic leaks can be diagnosed with a T-tube cholangiogram and be managed by leaving the tube open without further intervention. In patients without a T-tube, ERC is considered the gold standard diagnostic method in detecting bile leaks. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA) scanning, which has a sensitivity of approximately 50 percent and a specificity of approximately 80 percent, can be helpful in cases where there is a low suspicion for a bile leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>].</p><p>Placement of a plastic biliary stent, with or without biliary sphincterotomy is successful in treating 90 to 95 percent of early bile leaks. As a result, if there is a strong clinical suspicion, ERC is the treatment of choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/4,5,75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,75,76</a>]. In some cases, small leaks can be managed with biliary sphincterotomy alone; however, data are limited for this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. In contrast to postcholecystectomy leaks, where the stent can be removed in four to six weeks, in post-LT leaks we prefer the stent be left in place for approximately two months because of problems with delayed healing that may arise due to immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Stents are not changed during this period unless there is a clinical suspicion of obstruction. At the end of this period, the leak has typically healed and no other stent is needed.</p><p>However, short-duration stenting (two to three weeks) is preferred by some experts. In our experience, two to three weeks may be too early in some patients, particularly those who are on full immunosuppression. Nevertheless, removing the stent in four to six weeks may be reasonable in patients who are clinically well and are not receiving a full immunosuppressive regimen.</p><p>Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy anastomotic leaks are less common. A suspected bile leak in such patients can be diagnosed with a HIDA scan if the patient does not have a drainage catheter in place. ERC is often not feasible due to anatomic difficulties in reaching the biliary anastomosis. Management is usually performed with percutaneous internal-external drainage. Bile leaks in patients with Roux-en-Y anatomy more often require surgical management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ercp-in-patients-with-roux-en-y-anatomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ERCP in patients with Roux-en-Y anatomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Late bile leaks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Late bile duct leaks are usually related to the removal of the T-tube, resulting from delay in T-tube tract maturation due to immunosuppression. A bile leak should be suspected in patients who develop pain when the T-tube is removed.</p><p>ERC (with or without sphincterotomy) with placement of transpapillary stents is indicated, particularly in cases with abdominal pain and tenderness. In some cases, symptoms resolve with analgesia and without specific intervention within one week. If abdominal pain and tenderness persist and a leak is confirmed, management with ERC and placement of transpapillary stents is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/1-6,8,75,76,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6,8,75,76,78</a>]. Surgery or a percutaneous transhepatic approach is reserved for patients in whom the endoscopic approach is unsuccessful.</p><p>Some centers use nasobiliary tubes instead of stents. An advantage is that nasobiliary tubes permit cholangiographic follow-up without the need for further endoscopies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].

Most post-LT bilomas occur in the perihepatic area, outside of the liver. If the biloma occurs in the hepatic parenchyma and communicates with the biliary tree, it may resolve spontaneously or, in some cases, be managed with endoscopy and a transpapillary stent. In this setting, the role of endoscopy is more diagnostic than therapeutic, as disrupted bile ducts may not completely communicate with the extrahepatic ducts.</p><p>Large bilomas not communicating with the bile ducts should be treated with percutaneous drainage and antibiotics. Surgery is indicated when the bile leak cannot be effectively controlled with nonsurgical methods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON BILE DUCT FILLING DEFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Filling defects in the bile duct after LT can be due to gallstones, sludge, blood clots, casts, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> migrated stents; most are caused by stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Biliary stones, casts, and sludge are relatively common following LT, with an incidence between 2.5 and 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/3-5,10,79-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,10,79-81</a>].

The pathogenesis is unclear; one hypothesis is that denervation of the common bile duct in the ampullary region (secondary to surgical intervention) leads to the development of a hypertonic sphincter, causing dilated ducts and cholestasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/13,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,41</a>]. </p><p>SOD should be suspected in patients with cholestasis and a uniformly dilated bile duct without filling defects; abdominal pain is not usually present.

Its formation is insidious and therefore difficult to diagnose.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Types of complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors include the type of biliary reconstruction, acute hepatic artery thrombosis, hepatic artery stenosis, prolonged warm or cold ischemia, cytomegalovirus infection, ABO blood group mismatch, donation after cardiac death, and primary sclerosing cholangitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50456 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As a general rule, a right upper quadrant ultrasound with Doppler examination of the hepatic vasculature is the first step in the evaluation of a post-liver transplantation patient with asymptomatic elevations in liver enzymes or bilirubin. If there is a strong clinical suspicion of biliary pathology, the patient should proceed directly to endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC), whereas magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) may be preferred if the index of suspicion for bile duct abnormalities is low. A liver biopsy may be necessary if rejection or recurrent disease is suspected. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is reserved for patients with Roux-en-Y anatomy or ERC failures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56381\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef56381 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with an anastomotic stricture, we suggest repeated ERC sessions with balloon dilatation (6 to 8 mm) and placement of multiple plastic stents (7 to 11.5 Fr), with routine stent changes every three months (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). An increasing number of stents can be used at each session to achieve maximum diameter. Most patients will require between three and five sessions. (See <a href=\"#H148027761\" class=\"local\">'Anastomotic strictures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonanastomotic strictures are more difficult to treat than anastomotic strictures. In such patients, we suggest ERC with balloon dilatation (4 to 6 mm) and stent placement (10 to 11.5 Fr) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Many patients with diffuse strictures ultimately require retransplantation. (See <a href=\"#H148028645\" class=\"local\">'Nonanastomotic strictures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with bile duct strictures, irrespective of their nature, require lifelong surveillance since strictures tend to recur. We monitor patients with periodic evaluation of liver enzymes, liver ultrasound, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> MRCP, depending upon the nature and duration of the stricture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with early or late bile leaks, we suggest ERC with placement of a plastic stent, with or without sphincterotomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Stents should remain in place for two months to allow for healing. Surgery is reserved for leaks that do not respond to stenting. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Bile leaks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with large bilomas not communicating with the bile ducts, we suggest percutaneous drainage and antibiotics. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Biloma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with common bile duct filling defects (such as gallstones, sludge, blood clots, casts, and migrated stents), we suggest ERC and sphincterotomy with extraction of the filling defect (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Common bile duct filling defects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with suspected sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, we suggest biliary sphincterotomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Stratta RJ, Wood RP, Langnas AN, et al.
