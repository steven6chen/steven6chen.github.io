The vast majority of human hematologic neoplasms are caused by the clonal expansion of a single cell that has acquired a somatic mutation in one allele of an otherwise normal gene (proto-oncogene) governing cellular maturation and division. This mutated gene, now called an oncogene, stimulates inappropriate cellular proliferation, leading to the development of cancer.</p><p>Whereas multiple, random cytogenetic abnormalities are a characteristic finding in advanced malignancies, tumor-specific chromosomal translocations contribute directly to malignant transformation. Such translocations, and other genetic abnormalities, have been described for a large number of hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies, including the acute and chronic lymphoid and myeloid leukemias, other myeloproliferative disorders, myelodysplastic syndromes, multiple myeloma (plasma cell myeloma), and malignant lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>A classic example is the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), the first cytogenetic abnormality identified in a human malignancy, which is present in over 90 percent of individuals with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Initially described in 1960 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], this small chromosome originates from the reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), which forms a transcriptionally active fusion gene between the BCR gene on chromosome 22 and the ABL1 locus on chromosome 9 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62227\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62227 \">figure 1</a>). The chimeric protein that is encoded by the newly created BCR-ABL1 gene on the Ph chromosome is involved in leukemogenesis through its interference with normal cell cycle events, such as signal transduction and the regulation of apoptosis and cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chromosomal-translocations-deletions-and-inversions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chromosomal translocations, deletions, and inversions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellular and molecular biology of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The BCR-ABL1 translocation is a diagnostic hallmark of CML and the only distinct chromosome abnormality seen in the chronic phase of this disorder. In addition, its presence is an important indicator of residual disease or relapse after treatment. Sensitive molecular genetic and cytogenetic methods to detect this translocation are now available for initial diagnosis and quantitative monitoring of disease status in patients with CML. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Detecting the Philadelphia chromosome or its products'</a>.)</p><p>Because BCR-ABL1 is the most common and best studied tumor-specific translocation in the hematopoietic malignancies, we shall use this fusion gene as a model for the ability of cytogenetic and molecular genetic diagnostic tools to help us understand the pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and monitoring of disease activity in the various hematologic malignancies. Methods for molecular and cytogenetic diagnosis are summarized separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tools for genetics and genomics: Cytogenetics and molecular genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC MYELOID LEUKEMIA AS A MODEL SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is approximately 1 to 2 cases per 100,000. It is slightly more common in males than in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and accounts for 15 to 20 percent of all leukemias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Because it is a disorder arising from a mutational event in a somatic cell, chromosomes in all tissues are normal except in affected cells within the hematopoietic system. In one study for example, the Philadelphia chromosome was found in cells from all hematopoietic lineages with the exception of mature T-lymphocytes, supporting the hypothesis that CML results from a single aberrant chromosomal event occurring in a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

After the intervening sequences (introns) are spliced out, the gene can be expressed as a 6.0 or 7.0 kb messenger RNA (mRNA). This range in sizes is due to the alternative splicing of exons 2 through 11 to either exon 1a or, less commonly, to exon 1b, which is larger, as shown in panel A (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66610\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66610 \">figure 2</a>). The resulting protein is a tyrosine kinase with a molecular weight of 145 kilodalton (kD).

The BCR mRNAs are 4.5 or 6.7 kb in size; both encode a 160 kD protein with <span class=\"nowrap\">serine/threonine</span> kinase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

This mRNA comprises about half of the BCR exons at the centromeric 5' end, and ABL1 exons 2 to 11 towards the 3' end [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The breakpoints in the major breakpoint cluster region (M-bcr) are located either between exons b2 and b3 (exons 13 and 14 of the BCR gene), or between exons b3 and b4 (BCR exons 14 and 15). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellular and molecular biology of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'BCR-ABL1'</a>.)</p><p>The indication of exons within the breakpoint cluster region (ie, exons b1 through b5), rather than a numbering according to their position within the BCR gene as a whole (ie, exons 12 through 16), dates back to the time when the BCR gene was not yet fully characterized and remains popular in the literature. To avoid confusion with other reports, we will adhere to this original BCR breakpoint indication. Whereas ABL1 breakpoints can occur 5' to exon 1b, as well as in introns 1, 2, or 3, the great majority of patients demonstrate a chimeric transcript in which the BCR segment is spliced to exon a2 of the ABL1 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Therefore, the RNA transcripts in most patients consist of ABL1 a2, spliced to BCR exons b2 or b3, denoted as b2a2 or b3a2, as shown in panel C (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66610\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66610 \">figure 2</a>). In some patients with a confirmed b3a2 junction, coexpression of transcripts b3a2 and b2a2 can be detected, due to alternative splicing in which exon b3 is selectively spliced out. The encoded fusion protein, commonly described as <span class=\"nowrap\">p210BCR/ABL1,</span> because of its molecular weight of 210 kDa, possesses the oncogenic dysregulated kinase activity.</p><p>Virtually all patients with CML exhibit the b2a2 or the b3a2 junction, generated by a breakpoint within M-bcr. In addition to M-bcr, however, two other breakpoint cluster regions have been identified. The minor breakpoint cluster region, m-bcr, is located upstream of M-bcr (ie, towards the centromeric, or 5' end) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and the micro breakpoint cluster region (&micro;-bcr) is located downstream of M-bcr, towards the telomeric, or 3' end, as shown in panel B (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66610\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66610 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The m-bcr is rarely affected in individuals with CML, but serves as a breakpoint for two thirds of patients with ALL. The e1a2 fusion arises after alternative exons 1 and 2 are selectively spliced out, as shown in panel B (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66610\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66610 \">figure 2</a>). The resulting protein is only 190 kD, smaller than the product of the M-bcr [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Only in rare cases is a breakpoint in the &micro;-bcr identified. The junction between BCR exon 19 and ABL1 exon 2 leads to a 230 kD protein product, as shown in panels A, B, and C (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66610\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66610 \">figure 2</a>), which has been described in CML and, more frequently, in patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Chronic neutrophilic leukemia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">ABL1/BCR fusion gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In reciprocal translocations, two non-homologous chromosomes exchange parts. As a consequence of the BCR-ABL1 translocation, chromosome 9 should exhibit fusion with the telomeric chromosome piece that was separated from chromosome 22 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62227\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62227 \">figure 1</a>). This rarely reported reciprocal product [der(9)] was demonstrated to be present in approximately 60 percent of patients with CML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the BCR-ABL1 hybrid product, the ABL1 breakpoint is observed at exon a2 because the splicing machinery selectively removes the exons upstream. When the ABL1-BCR fusion gene undergoes transcription, however, the ABL1 breakpoint commonly occurs upstream of exon 1b, between exons 1b and 1a, or downstream of exon 1a, as shown in panel A (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66610\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66610 \">figure 2</a>). This leads to a greater variety of fusion transcripts, consisting of a small portion of the ABL1 gene and a larger portion of the BCR gene. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Reciprocal translocation product'</a>.)</p><p>The observation of one (or occasionally more, when alternative splicing occurs within one individual) of the four 1b-BCR messages (1be2,1bb3,1bb4 and 1be20) in the majority of CML cases, has been ascribed to the sizable intron between ABL1 exons 1b and 1a, which is likely to contain the preponderance of ABL1 breakpoints. The newly formed junctions are in-frame and encode a message that could be translated into a functional protein sequence and expressed by the cell. The significance of the ABL1-BCR fusion protein, however, is still unclear. A major role in leukemogenesis is improbable, because it is not expressed in 40 percent of Ph positive CML patients. However, there are some reports of decreased survival rates in CML patients who have a deletion of ABL1 on the derivative chromosome 9, as well as deletion of the proximal region, including the argininosuccinate synthase gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Further prospective studies are necessary to clarify this issue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69720132\"><span class=\"h2\">Infrequent breakpoints in BCR and ABL1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fewer than 10 percent of CML clones have breakpoints outside the M-bcr. Apart from the e1a2 junction in m-bcr (described above), and the infrequent e19a2 transcript in &micro;-bcr, there are a few rare outliers. These include fusion transcripts b2a3, e1a3, e19a3, e20a3 and e6a2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Occasionally, translocation breakpoints can occur within coding exons, as exemplified in two patients with partial e8a2 and partial b2a2 fusions, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69720139\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical implications of various breakpoints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Considering the variety of BCR and ABL1 breakpoints as well as RNA transcripts in CML, the question arises whether these molecular differences induce phenotypic variation in disease course and survival. Whereas some early reports suggested such correlations, other studies refute the early results. In one large-scale prospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], no prognostic association between the genomic M-bcr breakpoint site or RNA message, and duration of the chronic phase or survival, was detected. The only possible correlation that was detected in a small number of patients whose WBC count was lower than <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/&micro;L,</span> was one between platelet count and the b3a2 transcript.</p><p>In contrast to the lack of genotype-phenotype variation within M-bcr CML, distinct clinical features, resembling both CML and CMML, are exhibited by patients who express <span class=\"nowrap\">p190BCR/ABL1</span> due to a breakpoint in m-bcr. There is an increase in peripheral immature granulocytes, considerable monocytosis, and a variable degree of basophilia. These features are consistent with a myeloproliferative disorder that includes expansion of the monocytic lineage, which is not characteristic of CML with <span class=\"nowrap\">p210BCR/ABL1</span>. This observation is supported by the fact that all cases of m-bcr AML fell into the French-American-British (FAB) classification M4 or M5a, which are subgroups with myelomonocytic (M4) or monocytic (M5) proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Adults with ALL who express either <span class=\"nowrap\">p210BCR/ABL1</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">p190BCR/ABL1</span> are phenotypically very similar, but in children there may be a distinction. Childhood ALL due to a breakpoint in M-bcr is uncommon, but, when present, tends to be associated with hyperleukocytic ALL (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66337\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66337 \">table 1</a>). Firm conclusions, however, cannot be drawn, due to the small number of patients studied and the possibility that their malignancy may represent lymphoid blast crisis after an undiagnosed prior chronic phase of CML. However, in all types of ALL, the presence of Ph confers a poor prognosis.</p><p>The largest fusion protein described for the BCR-ABL1 translocation has a molecular weight of 230 kD and is most often associated with chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL). This rare disorder is closely related to CML, but in most instances, the disease course is more prolonged and symptoms are less severe. Compared with classic CML, the WBC count is lower and anemia is less pronounced. Moreover, the percentage of peripheral immature granulocytes is low and the spleen is only mildly enlarged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Only 2 of 10 CNL patients reported to date have progressed to the acute leukemic phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A subset of patients has significant thrombocytosis, but the etiology of this finding is, as yet, unknown. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Chronic neutrophilic leukemia'</a> below.)</p><p>In contrast to ALL, CML patients in whom no BCR-ABL1 fusion product can be detected have a lower survival rate than individuals with the translocation. The patients who lack BCR-ABL1 are of a higher age, have lower WBC counts, higher frequency of thrombocytopenia, less prominent basophilia, and an increasing leukemic burden, even though progression to overt blast crisis is less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69719826\"><span class=\"h2\">Detection of Ph and BCR-ABL1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most widely applied diagnostic method for CML is karyotyping of metaphase chromosomes by cytogenetic studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62227\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62227 \">figure 1</a>). The Ph chromosome is identified in approximately 90 percent of new patients with CML, and the progression to a more aggressive leukemic stage can be detected or confirmed by the emergence of additional structural or numerical chromosome abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p>DNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and Southern blotting can determine individual breakpoints precisely, but are less suitable for routine translocation detection, due to the broad distribution of possible translocation breakpoints and the prohibitive length of some introns. The intron-less mRNA transcript, on the other hand, is an excellent molecular template and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) will detect a BCR-ABL1 fusion in an additional one-half of the patients who are Ph negative by chromosome banding techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Some of these cases proved to be caused by complex gene rearrangements, involving one or more chromosomes in addition to 9 and 22 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74102\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74102 \">figure 3</a>).

A contributing factor to apparent Ph and BCR-ABL1 negativity may be the choice of probes used in the detection assay. Most studies that have investigated BCR-ABL1 negative CML have selected probes that would be unable to detect breakpoints in regions outside the M-bcr.</p><p>A small subset of patients may indeed lack the BCR-ABL1 hybrid gene. The majority of these cases have an atypical disease course with less frequent progression to blast crisis, and may need to be categorized under different diagnoses, such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), chronic neutrophilic leukemia, or &quot;atypical CML&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].

Not surprisingly, the vast majority of cytogenetic changes in MDS are also seen in AML, supporting the view that these disorders represent a continuum rather than strictly separate entities.

Hyperdiploidy is often accompanied by structural rearrangements, but recurrent translocations are rare and the isolation of specific breakpoint genes remains impractical. Hence, in order to monitor residual disease, interphase FISH is generally more useful than RT-PCR, provided that the appropriate probes are available.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Chronic myeloid leukemia as a model system'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CML is derived from an abnormal pluripotent stem cell that has acquired the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. This fusion gene is the product of a balanced translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, denoted t(9;22) (q34.1;q11.21), which juxtaposes a 5&rsquo; segment of a breakpoint cluster region (BCR) at 22q11 and the 3&rsquo; segment of the ABL oncogene (ABL1) at 9q34, resulting in an abnormally small chromosome known as the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. As a consequence of the BCR-ABL1 translocation, chromosome 9 should also exhibit fusion with the telomeric chromosome piece that was separated from chromosome 22 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62227\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62227 \">figure 1</a>), reported as the reciprocal product der(9). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'BCR and ABL1 genes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic testing for the Ph chromosome, the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene or the fusion mRNA gene product can be done by conventional cytogenetic analysis (karyotyping), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), or by Southern blot. Karyotyping is widely applied for the diagnosis of CML while quantitative RT-PCR is frequently employed to assess response to therapy. (See <a href=\"#H69719826\" class=\"local\">'Detection of Ph and BCR-ABL1'</a> above and <a href=\"#H69719770\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring of residual disease'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tools for genetics and genomics: Cytogenetics and molecular genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whereas the Ph chromosome is a recognized hallmark of CML, it is by no means exclusive to this disorder, and has been seen in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and other hematologic malignancies. The mere presence of a BCR-ABL1 rearrangement in these disorders, however, does not prove that it is the primary cause. Since the number of chromosomal abnormalities tends to increase during the course of these chronic disorders, the appearance of the Ph chromosome may be interpreted as a secondary abnormality. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'The Ph chromosome in malignancies other than CML'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent genetic abnormalities are commonly found in other hematologic and lymphoid malignancies. In many of these disorders, assessment for genetic changes is a routine part of the diagnostic evaluation and the results of such tests often affect prognosis and treatment. </p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Mitelman F, Johansson B, Mertens F.
