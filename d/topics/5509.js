A retrospective study found that among patients treated with fluvoxamine (n = 43) or paroxetine (n = 50), the frequency of discontinuation symptoms was comparable (14 and 20 percent of patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/discontinuing-antidepressant-medications-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Euthymic patients who abruptly stop antidepressants or taper them too quickly are also at risk for suffering depressive symptoms, in addition to discontinuation symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/discontinuing-antidepressant-medications-in-adults/abstract/2,8,16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,16-20</a>].

However, resolution of symptoms within a few days of restarting the antidepressant or after one to two weeks of watchful waiting is more consistent with a discontinuation syndrome than depressive relapse.</p><p>In addition, discontinuation symptoms may be mistaken for other medical conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/discontinuing-antidepressant-medications-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

However, this is not standard clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H211109\"><span class=\"h1\">STANDARD APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Education about the potential for and nature of discontinuation symptoms at the onset of treatment may prevent patients from skipping doses or abruptly stopping antidepressants on their own and help reduce anxiety should adverse discontinuation effects occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/discontinuing-antidepressant-medications-in-adults/abstract/1,9,10,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,10,27</a>]. Included in the education is the point that discontinuation symptoms are not unique to antidepressants and do not indicate that antidepressants cause addiction or dependence.</p><p>For patients who are treated with an antidepressant for at least several (eg, three to five) weeks, and are stopping the drug without switching to another antidepressant, the standard approach to minimize discontinuation symptoms is to progressively taper (reduce) the dose by a fixed amount or percent for at least two to four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/discontinuing-antidepressant-medications-in-adults/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. For patients who are treated with antidepressants for a briefer time period (eg, one to three) weeks, the drug can be tapered over one to two weeks, and for patients treated for seven days or less, the drug can be abruptly stopped. This standard approach is consistent with multiple treatment guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/discontinuing-antidepressant-medications-in-adults/abstract/9-11,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11,30,31</a>].</p><p>The specific duration of the taper depends primarily upon the clinical urgency and the drug&rsquo;s elimination half-life. Abrupt discontinuation may be necessary in some clinical situations (eg, severe adverse side effect or unintended pregnancy). Drugs with a longer half-life (eg, &ge;24 hours) can generally be tapered over two to three weeks, whereas drugs with shorter half-lives (eg, &lt;24 hours) are tapered over four weeks if it is practical. For patients who suffer discontinuation symptoms despite a gradual taper, the duration of the taper is extended beyond four weeks, and depends upon the pace that the patient can tolerate.</p><p>Management of discontinuation symptoms depends upon their severity and time of onset:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild discontinuation symptoms that occur despite a gradual taper are managed with reassurance and watchful waiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/discontinuing-antidepressant-medications-in-adults/abstract/1,11,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If moderate to severe discontinuation symptoms occur during a two to four week taper, clinicians can decrease the pace and taper the drugs over 6 to 12 weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If moderate to severe symptoms arise after the drug is stopped, the antidepressant is restarted at the dose at which there were no symptoms, and the taper is recommenced at a pace slower than the initial taper [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/discontinuing-antidepressant-medications-in-adults/abstract/1,11,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternatively, for patients who have difficulty tapering off of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a>) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>, it is reasonable to immediately switch to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> 10 to 20 mg per day; the fluoxetine can then be tapered off, typically without discontinuation effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/discontinuing-antidepressant-medications-in-adults/abstract/9-11,14,27,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11,14,27,32</a>] (see <a href=\"#H211595\" class=\"local\">'SSRIs'</a> below).

Patients switched to fluoxetine 10 mg per day continue the dose for one to two weeks after the discontinuation symptoms have resolved, after which fluoxetine is stopped.

For patients who are treated with an antidepressant for at least several (eg, three to five) weeks, and are stopping the drug without switching to another antidepressant, the standard approach to minimize discontinuation symptoms is to taper the dose for at least two to four weeks.

If moderate to severe discontinuation symptoms occur during a two to four week taper, clinicians can decrease the pace and taper the drugs over 6 to 12 weeks. If disturbing symptoms arise after the drug is stopped, the antidepressant is restarted at the dose at which there were no symptoms, and the taper recommences at a pace slower than the initial taper. Alternatively, for patients who have difficulty tapering off of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>, it is reasonable to immediately switch to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> 10 to 20 mg per day; the fluoxetine can then be tapered off.
