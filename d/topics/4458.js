Most cases resolve spontaneously. Congenital dacryocystocele occurs less commonly, but is associated with potentially serious complications and hence requires urgent referral to an ophthalmologist.</p><p>The clinical features, evaluation, and management of congenital NLD obstruction and dacryocystocele will be discussed below. The anatomy of the lacrimal system, other causes of persistent tearing, and the approach to the child with persistent tearing are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-persistent-tearing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with persistent tearing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H717054611\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tears are produced by the main and accessory lacrimal glands and drain medially into the puncta, then flow through the canaliculi to the lacrimal sac, and then through the nasolacrimal duct (NLD) into the nose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53429\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53429 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-persistent-tearing#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with persistent tearing&quot;, section on 'Anatomy of the lacrimal system'</a>.)</p><p>During embryonic development, the nasolacrimal apparatus appears in the third to fifth week and gradually forms a cord of epithelium that extends from the eyelids to the nose. Canalization of the cord begins at the punctum in the eyelid during the third month of intrauterine life and extends toward the nose. Canalization is usually complete by birth.</p><p>Congenital NLD obstruction and dacryocystocele are caused by obstructions at different locations in the nasolacrimal system:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Congenital NLD obstruction</strong> &minus; The most common cause of congenital NLD obstruction is incomplete canalization at the distal end (ie, closest to the nose), leaving an imperforate membrane at the valve of Hasner (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53429\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53429 \">figure 1</a>); however, NLD obstruction can also occur at other sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-nasolacrimal-duct-obstruction-dacryostenosis-and-dacryocystocele/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Like simple congenital NLD obstruction, the distal obstruction is usually at the level of the membrane of Hasner. The proximal obstruction typically occurs in the common canaliculus or at the valve of Rosenmuller (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53429\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53429 \">figure 1</a>). The proximal obstruction is a one-way valve that permits tears to enter, but not to reflux out of the canaliculi of the lacrimal drainage system. This results in distention of the lacrimal sac and duct, which appears as a bluish bulge below the medial canthus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62273\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62273 \">picture 1</a>).

In cases that do not resolve by age 6 to 10 months, lacrimal duct probing is performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101554\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101554 \">algorithm 1</a>). For older children, who usually require general anesthesia for surgical intervention, NLD intubation is often performed rather than simple probing. More invasive surgical interventions (which include balloon dacryoplasty, dacryocystorhinostomy, and conjunctivodacryocystorhinostomy) are reserved for patients with treatment failure after less invasive interventions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonsurgical management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>External digital massage of the lacrimal sac is the first-line treatment for NLD obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-nasolacrimal-duct-obstruction-dacryostenosis-and-dacryocystocele/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Massage is believed to relieve the obstruction by increasing the hydrostatic pressure enough to force open the obstructed distal membrane.</p><p>Lacrimal sac massage is performed by applying moderate pressure over the lacrimal sac in a downward direction for 2 to 3 seconds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101426\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101426 \">figure 2</a>). Caregivers are instructed to perform this maneuver two to three times per day until symptoms resolve. Demonstrating the technique for lacrimal sac massage on both the child and the caregivers (so that caregivers understand how much pressure to apply) is helpful. Caregivers should be instructed to keep their fingernails trimmed and to wash their hands before performing lacrimal sac massage.</p><p>Purulent eye discharge occurs commonly in infants with NLD obstruction and, in the absence of other signs of infection, suggests bacterial overgrowth in the stagnant tear pool of the lacrimal sac. Topical antibiotics may be helpful in controlling bacterial overgrowth. (See <a href=\"#H772424906\" class=\"local\">'Chronic dacryocystitis'</a> below.)</p><p>Purulent eye discharge associated with other signs of infection such as erythema <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> swelling suggests acute dacryocystitis, which requires systemic antibiotic therapy.

Evaluation should include comprehensive eye exam, including cycloplegic refraction to look for anisometropia, which can occur in approximately 10 percent of patients with congenital NLD obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-nasolacrimal-duct-obstruction-dacryostenosis-and-dacryocystocele/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>].</p><p>Lacrimal duct probing is the first-line surgical procedure for young infants with symptoms of congenital NLD obstruction that persist beyond the age of six months. The procedure is performed by an ophthalmologist in the office or the operating room, dependent upon the age of the child (children &ge;12 months usually require general anesthesia) and the experience and preference of the ophthalmologist. In the office setting, the probing procedure usually takes only 2 to 3 minutes if the child's anatomy is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-nasolacrimal-duct-obstruction-dacryostenosis-and-dacryocystocele/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The procedure is performed by inserting a small blunt probe or irrigation cannula into the punctum and advancing it through the lacrimal drainage system until it abuts the obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76279\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76279 \">picture 4</a>). The probe is then pushed gently through the obstruction into the nose. Irrigation with fluorescein-stained saline is often performed to ensure patency.</p><p>The optimal timing of probing for infants with congenital NLD obstruction is an area of controversy. Many ophthalmologists perform early probing if symptoms have not resolved by the age of 6 to 10 months. The advantages of probing at this age compared with deferring the procedure until the child is &ge;12 months of age are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-nasolacrimal-duct-obstruction-dacryostenosis-and-dacryocystocele/abstract/1,2,7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,7,10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The procedure can usually be performed in the office without general anesthesia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It results in earlier resolution of symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of infection and lacrimal duct scarring may be lower</p><p/><p>In infants with severe symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bilateral NLD obstruction, early probing may be particularly helpful. Parental preferences also play an important role in the decision to perform early versus delayed probing.</p><p>The main disadvantage of early surgical intervention is that, because the rate of spontaneous resolution is high, some children may undergo unnecessary probing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-nasolacrimal-duct-obstruction-dacryostenosis-and-dacryocystocele/abstract/1,2,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,10</a>]. Hence, an alternative approach is to defer surgical intervention until after 12 months of age to allow more time for spontaneous resolution. Children who undergo surgical intervention for NLD obstruction after age 12 months usually require general anesthesia. NLD intubation is often performed rather than simple probing in children whose first procedure is performed under general anesthesia because of the higher success rate of NLD intubation. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Treatment failure'</a> below.)</p><p>The efficacy of NLD probing for treatment congenital NLD obstruction is supported by two small randomized trials, case series, and clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-nasolacrimal-duct-obstruction-dacryostenosis-and-dacryocystocele/abstract/11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-16</a>]. NLD probing is successful in relieving the obstruction in approximately 75 to 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-nasolacrimal-duct-obstruction-dacryostenosis-and-dacryocystocele/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. Studies are inconsistent regarding the relationship between the age at which probing is performed and the success rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-nasolacrimal-duct-obstruction-dacryostenosis-and-dacryocystocele/abstract/3,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12-15</a>]. In a large multicenter prospective study, no association was observed between age and success rate in children &lt;3 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-nasolacrimal-duct-obstruction-dacryostenosis-and-dacryocystocele/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The probability of success was slightly lower when the procedure was performed in the office setting rather than a surgical facility (72 versus 80 percent).</p><p>Outcomes with early versus deferred probing were evaluated in a multicenter randomized controlled trial of 163 infants with congenital NLD obstruction with unresolved symptoms at 6 to 10 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-nasolacrimal-duct-obstruction-dacryostenosis-and-dacryocystocele/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients were randomly assigned to immediate office-based probing (n = 82) or six months of nonsurgical management (n = 81) followed by surgery (under general anesthesia) for those with persistent symptoms. Among patients in the deferred group, 66 percent (44 of 67) had resolution of symptoms without surgery and 27 percent (22 of 81) underwent surgery. Four patients underwent early surgery because of worsening symptoms, parent request, or development of cellulitis within the observation period. Among patients in the immediate office probing group, 9 percent (7 of 81) required reoperation under general anesthesia for persistent NLD obstruction after the initial procedure. At age 18 months, 92 percent (69 of 75) of infants treated with immediate office probing had no residual signs of NLD obstruction, compared with 82 percent (58 of 71) of those who received nonsurgical management initially. The immediate office probing group experienced three (95% CI 1.8-4.0) fewer months of symptoms. Costs were lower for patients treated with immediate office probing compared with nonsurgical management.</p><p>Cost is an important consideration in deciding whether to perform early probing in the office setting versus delayed probing or NLD intubation in the operating room. The cost effectiveness is dependent upon the spontaneous resolution rate. The clinical trial described above, in which the observed spontaneous resolution rate was 66 percent, reported that early office-based probing was associated with lower per patient costs. Another study modeled the costs of the two approaches using different estimates of spontaneous resolution rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-nasolacrimal-duct-obstruction-dacryostenosis-and-dacryocystocele/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Assuming a spontaneous resolution rate of 75 percent, the incremental cost of immediate office-based probing over deferred probing in the operating room was estimated to be $44 (2009 US dollars) per month of symptoms avoided; with a 90 percent spontaneous resolution rate, the cost increased to $169 per month.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial NLD probing is unsuccessful in 10 to 25 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-nasolacrimal-duct-obstruction-dacryostenosis-and-dacryocystocele/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>]. Options for further management of these infants include performing a second probing procedure or an alternative procedure. If the first probing procedure was uncomplicated and the infant is &lt;12 months or &lt;9 kilograms, repeat office probing may be attempted. The success rate of repeat probing has been reported to be 56 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-nasolacrimal-duct-obstruction-dacryostenosis-and-dacryocystocele/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In infants who tolerated the initial procedure poorly <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> children &ge;12 months of age, one of the following procedures (both of which require general anesthesia) is generally performed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NLD intubation &minus; NLD intubation involves probing the NLD and placing a silicone stent within it.

Congenital dacryocystocele (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62273\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62273 \">picture 1</a>) occurs less commonly, but is associated with potentially serious complications and hence requires urgent referral to an ophthalmologist.

Conjunctival erythema is not typical. On physical examination, there is often an increase in the size of the tear meniscus.
