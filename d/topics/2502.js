It can also cause long-term joint problems. It is caused by a build-up of a type of calcium crystals (called &quot;calcium pyrophosphate&quot;) in the joints. Sudden attacks of CPPD disease used to be called &quot;pseudogout.&quot;</p><p>The symptoms of CPPD disease are similar to the symptoms of another type of arthritis, called gout. But CPPD disease and gout have different causes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1566510\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of CPPD disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with a flare-up of CPPD disease can get sudden attacks of joint pain, swelling, and warmth &ndash; often in the knee. The symptoms can also happen in the ankles, feet, shoulders, elbows, wrists, and hands. Attacks can last for days or weeks.</p><p>In some people, CPPD disease leads to long-term osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis. It causes pain and stiffness in different joints in the body. Sometimes it also causes joint swelling. Less often, CPPD disease can lead to other joint problems, which can look like other types of arthritis.</p><p>Some patients with CPPD disease have very mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1566517\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for CPPD disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To check if your symptoms are caused by CPPD disease, your doctor will do an exam and tests. Tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Removing fluid from the painful joint &ndash; A doctor will put a needle in the joint to remove a small sample of fluid. Then he or she will look at the fluid under a microscope to see if the calcium crystals are present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>X-rays of the painful joints</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests &ndash; Your doctor will do blood tests to see if you have a condition that could be causing the calcium crystals to build up.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1566524\"><span class=\"h1\">How is CPPD disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment often depends on how many joints are involved.</p><p>Doctors usually treat people who have 1 or 2 painful joints by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Removing some fluid from the painful joint</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giving a shot of a medicine into the painful joint</p><p/><p>Doctors usually treat people who have more than 2 painful joints with medicines called &quot;NSAIDs.&quot; NSAIDs are a large group of medicines that includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">indomethacin</a> (sample brand names: Indocin, Indocid), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve). If a person can't take NSAIDs or has too many side effects from NSAIDs, other types of medicines are available.</p><p>These treatments help to shorten an attack and ease joint pain and swelling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1566531\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Doctors usually recommend that people rest their painful joints as much as possible when an attack happens. If your doctor recommends rest, try not to move your painful joint or put weight on it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1566538\"><span class=\"h1\">Can CPPD disease attacks be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. If you get a lot of attacks, your doctor might prescribe a medicine for you to take every day to help prevent future attacks. This medicine is called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">colchicine</a> (brand name: Colcrys).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1566545\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gout-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Gout (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoarthritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoarthritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-are-clinical-trials-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What are clinical trials?
