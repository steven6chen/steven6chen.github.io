Recurrent fever that is not due to infection is a clinical feature of several disorders that are collectively referred to as autoinflammatory diseases. HIDS is one of the major periodic fever syndromes, which is a subset of autoinflammatory diseases. An overview of periodic and recurrent fevers and other autoinflammatory diseases is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periodic fever syndromes and other autoinflammatory diseases: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The management of HIDS is reviewed here. The pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of HIDS are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-pathophysiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome: Pathophysiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3630490475\"><span class=\"h1\">COURSE AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, patients with HIDS have a normal lifespan and rarely suffer any serious physical complications of the disease, with the one uncommon exception of AA amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-management/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, the attacks may have a significant negative impact on quality of life (QoL), particularly if the episodes are more frequent and severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Social functioning, general health perception, vitality, autonomy, and social development were the QoL areas most impacted in one study. The periodic fever attacks are usually lifelong, although the frequency of attacks appears to decrease with age, and there are a few case reports of patients going into remission after therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-aa-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of AA amyloidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-aa-amyloidosis-and-relation-to-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of AA amyloidosis and relation to rheumatic diseases&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of AA (secondary) amyloidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GOALS OF MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of treatment is to alleviate the immediate symptoms for the purpose of improving quality of life (QoL) and avoiding unnecessary therapies. Amyloidosis, the one serious potential complication, is quite rare. The drugs used to control symptoms also ameliorate inflammation and may mitigate some of the long-term effects of inflammation, such as the development of amyloidosis. Curative treatments that are sufficiently low risk are lacking. Interventions that prevent the febrile episodes are available but are associated with a higher risk of adverse events and are therefore reserved for patients who develop amyloidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Alleviate symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic treatment of the fever and associated symptoms is one of the main focuses of management since the disease primarily affects QoL and rarely leads to severe physical complications. (See <a href=\"#H2538695876\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoid unnecessary surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who present with fever and severe abdominal pain prior to the diagnosis of HIDS may undergo exploratory laparotomy with or without appendectomy. Once the diagnosis of HIDS is established, a much higher threshold for exploratory surgery is appropriate. If the timing and nature of the symptoms are compatible with a recurrent episode, observation is appropriate. If, however, abdominal pain occurs at a shorter than usual interval or there are symptoms that are unusual for a particular patient, clinical judgement may favor laparotomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482663706\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoid unnecessary antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to diagnosis, patients are commonly given courses of antibiotics due to the symptoms of an attack mimicking an infection. A higher threshold for starting antibiotics is appropriate after diagnosis, particularly if the timing and nature of the symptoms are compatible with a recurrent episode. However, patients should be evaluated for an infectious etiology if the symptoms or course of an episode are atypical.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT EDUCATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Successful management of children with HIDS requires cooperation and involvement of the parents. The risks and benefits of the interventions must be weighed and compared with the disquiet that is required to simply observe a child who is having a febrile episode. Patients and families need to be informed about the benign prognosis, in that HIDS does not impact life expectancy, although it can impact quality of life (QoL), and the tradeoff between potential adverse effects and the limited evidence of effectiveness of available pharmacologic interventions.</p><p>Parental awareness of the general timing of episodes and of the child's symptoms can help assist clinicians in deciding when watchful waiting is appropriate versus pursuing additional diagnostic testing or even laparotomy, as discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Avoid unnecessary surgery'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3129262584\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach is based upon the limited available data and clinical experience. We first ask the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span> if they are comfortable with just observation during episodes or whether they would prefer symptomatic treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108431\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108431 \">algorithm 1</a>). If symptomatic treatment is chosen, we treat each attack with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), starting at the earliest sign of an attack and continuing for the predicted duration of the attack. Patients who do not respond to NSAIDs and who wish to continue treatment are switched to episodic oral glucocorticoids. For patients who do not respond to either NSAIDs or glucocorticoids or who would benefit from a steroid-sparing agent and still want to continue treating episodes, we use the biologic anakinra. We opt for observation in patients who fail to respond to all of the above therapies and use continuous rather than episodic treatment with a biologic agent only in patients who develop amyloidosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2538695876\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMATIC TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No universally reliable means of arresting or mitigating the symptoms of a febrile episode have yet been identified. Several pharmacologic agents have been used to treat febrile episodes and associated symptoms (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">arthralgia/arthritis,</span> abdominal pain), with varying results. Treatment options with the lowest risk of serious side effects are used first since there is minimal risk of long-term sequelae from the disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108431\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108431 \">algorithm 1</a>). Symptomatic treatment is started at the first sign of prodromal symptoms that are typical for the patient. These may include nasal congestion, sore throat, backache, fatigue, vertigo, headache, and behavioral changes. Not treating episodes is also an option. The symptoms of an attack are markedly blunted if treatment is started early, with the onset of prodromal symptoms, rather than waiting until the onset of fever and associated symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3541768835\"><span class=\"h2\">First-line therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observational data from case reports have shown that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) alleviate the height and duration of fevers and mitigate associated symptoms in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-management/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>] but not in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. NSAIDs are suggested as first-line therapy for fever and pain associated with HIDS episodes, rather than an oral glucocorticoid, if parents <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> patients opt for symptomatic management during these febrile episodes. NSAIDs are used for the predicted duration of the attack, typically for four to seven days, based upon the particular child's pattern. Episodic treatment can continue indefinitely, as long as the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/caregivers</span> wish to prevent symptoms from episodes.</p><p>There is no role for NSAIDs between episodes.</p><p>Treatment should be tailored to individual patients. Any NSAID can be used: generally, one that the parents and clinician are comfortable using and in doses appropriate for the child's age. The effectiveness of the NSAID should be evident with the treatment of each episode, often within the first dose or two. If there is a partial response to the initial dose, a higher dose, up to the manufacturer's recommended maximum, can be used and the effect observed. Some patients respond better to certain NSAIDs over others. Thus, if one NSAID is ineffective, another should be tried. Patients are considered refractory to NSAIDs only after several NSAIDs have been tried and failed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-pain-in-children#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of pain in children&quot;, section on 'NSAIDs'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2597428231\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients refractory to NSAIDs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Episodic treatment with glucocorticoids is the preferred next step in patients who fail treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) due to accessibility and simplicity of use. Treatment with a biologic agent is reserved for patients who fail both NSAIDs and glucocorticoids or who respond to glucocorticoids but require frequent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> higher doses and would benefit from a steroid-sparing agent. The shortest acting and least immunosuppressive biologic agent (eg, anakinra) is tried first.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1962613161\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For those who have a weak or nonexistent response to an NSAID and are willing to accept the potential adverse effect of a short course of systemic glucocorticoids, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, orally, maximum dose 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> for four to seven days, depending upon the typical duration of attacks in a patient. Dosing varies from a single pulse dose at the onset of prodromal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] to 30 mg prednisone daily for three days followed by a one-week taper [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> prednisone initial dose with a two-week taper [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The last dosing regimen listed was also shown to alleviate arthritic symptoms.</p><p>While no randomized, controlled trials are available, individual reports demonstrate good responses to oral glucocorticoids, usually given for one to two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-management/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Patients responded with normalized temperatures and markedly decreased symptoms. It usually takes a day or two for glucocorticoids to control the fever. One case report documented remission of febrile attacks after six courses of a single-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> (7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenously) given at the onset of an attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Glucocorticoids have well-known potential side effects, both short term, such as gastritis and mood disturbance, and long term, such as myopathy, bone demineralization, glaucoma, and elevated blood sugar. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4191155637\"><span class=\"h3\">Anti-IL-1 therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anakinra is a short-acting interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) that is dosed once daily. IL-1Ra, the physiologic inhibitor of IL-1, may be elevated during HIDS attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Febrile episodes in HIDS, as well as other periodic fever syndromes, may be caused by elevated IL-1 levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. One prospective, observational study showed effective use of anakinra as on-demand therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In this study of nine patients with HIDS who were offered the choice of treatment with anakinra prophylactically or on demand, eight out of nine selected on-demand therapy (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day,</span> maximum 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> for five to seven days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Eight of 12 attacks treated showed &gt;50 percent reduction in symptom duration and also decreased attack severity, but there was no change in attack frequency. Given the side-effect profile, as well as local injection-site reactions, symptomatic treatment with anakinra may be preferred over preventive treatment by clinicians and patients alike. Some experts switch patients who have responded to anakinra over to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=canakinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">canakinumab</a> due to a more favorable side effect profile and dosing schedule. (See <a href=\"#H1052427167\" class=\"local\">'Preventive treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>The most common, significant side effects of anakinra are hypersensitivity reactions and immune suppression leading to increased risk of severe infections and malignancy. Milder side effects include injection-site reactions and symptoms such as headache, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, rash, and arthralgia due to the immunomodulatory effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-biologic-agents-and-kinase-inhibitors-in-the-rheumatic-diseases#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of biologic agents and kinase inhibitors in the rheumatic diseases&quot;, section on 'Anakinra'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment#H15849649\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Biologic therapy'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rilonacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rilonacept</a>, a monoclonal antibody that binds IL-1 beta and also has some binding to IL-1Ra and IL-1 alpha, may work well for HIDS based upon its mechanisms of action, but there are no reports of its use for HIDS in the literature. Rilonacept has been used in patients with other types of periodic fever syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The effect of rilonacept lasts for a week or longer. Thus, a single dose could be used to treat attacks, although studies of this approach are needed.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=canakinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Canakinumab</a>, an IL-1 beta blocker, has a much slower onset of action and longer half-life (dosed every four to eight weeks) and as such is not suitable for episodic therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1052427167\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTIVE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevated acute-phase reactants and serum levels of inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin-1 (IL-1) beta, and IL-6 suggest that a systemic inflammatory process causes the symptoms during febrile attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-management/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>]. Anticytokine biologic therapies (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>, anakinra, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=canakinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">canakinumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a>) have shown promise at reducing the frequency and severity of attacks when used prophylactically, although the data are limited to case reports and case series. These agents have also been used to treat patients with secondary amyloidosis. Until further data are available, we use continuous, rather than episodic, treatment with a biologic agent only in patients with HIDS who have developed amyloidosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108431\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108431 \">algorithm 1</a>). Others may try prophylactic therapy with a biologic agent in patients with severe, frequent attacks that significantly diminish quality of life (QoL). The decision is ultimately made by the provider and <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span> after reviewing the risks and benefits of therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-pathophysiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome: Pathophysiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-amyloidosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of amyloidosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-aa-amyloidosis-and-relation-to-rheumatic-diseases#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of AA amyloidosis and relation to rheumatic diseases&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-amyloidosis#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of amyloidosis&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>There are two important points to remember with respect to the treatment of patients with such biologics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preponderance of HIDS febrile attacks does not lead to long-term sequelae.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most biologics carry the risk of severe infections; other common adverse events include local injection-site reactions that impact the tolerability of the therapy. Fever is an expected symptom of periodic attacks in patients with HIDS. However, every new episode of fever must be evaluated for the possibility of an infectious origin in patients treated with biologics.</p><p/><p>If prophylactic therapy is chosen and is successful, a reasonable approach is to wait at least 6 to 12 months before doing a trial off of prophylaxis. However, patients successfully treated with prophylaxis may never want to stop for fear of returning symptoms, particularly if they have not experienced any significant adverse events from therapy.

In the absence of even anecdotal documentation to support efficacy and given the significant side effect profile, we would not use colchicine for patients with HIDS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Cyclosporine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a paucity of data on the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> in this disease. Two patients in one family were treated with cyclosporine; one remained attack free for six years, while her brother had no benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous immune globulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data are sparse on the use of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG).

We are unaware of any other reports of successful use. In view of the expense and risk of adverse effects for IVIG, we would not use IVIG to treat HIDS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Statins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mevalonate kinase (MVK) is one enzymatic step downstream of the 3-hydroxy-3-methly-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase enzyme in the cholesterol synthetic pathway. Thus, use of an HMG-CoA reductase enzyme inhibitor (statin) seemed a logical choice for treatment of HIDS episodes. However, clinical experience has provided mixed results. These results, and an evolving understanding of the pathogenesis of disease symptoms, suggest that statins are unlikely to be efficacious and may instead increase the risk of exacerbating symptoms. Thus, we would not use statins to treat patients with HIDS.</p><p>In two cases of mevalonic aciduria (due to near or complete absence of MVK enzyme activity and resulting in a more severe phenotype than HIDS), treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lovastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lovastatin</a> resulted in worse crises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>A one-year study randomly assigned six adult patients with HIDS to statin therapy with a crossover design [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. There was no statistically significant difference in febrile days or severity between the statin and placebo periods. No deleterious effects were noted.

This was illustrated in a study of six adults with HIDS who were randomly assigned to thalidomide or placebo and followed for 36 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. No significant difference in the severity of symptoms and only a mild decrease in acute-phase reactant levels were noted in those treated with thalidomide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. No side effects were noted. In view of the frequent side effects of thalidomide, particularly somnolence and neuropathy, and the lack of supporting evidence of efficacy, we would not use thalidomide to treat HIDS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2207512798\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematopoietic cell transplanation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potentially curative therapy in the form of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has been performed for the more severe disorder, mevalonic aciduria, although the risks of allogeneic HCT outweigh any potential benefit for patients with HIDS given that it is not a lethal disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS) is a genetically inherited periodic fever syndrome associated with sustained high fevers, lymphadenopathy, abdominal pain, arthritis, and skin rashes. Interval periods range from four to eight weeks on average, during which patients remain completely asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of management are to alleviate symptoms, improve quality of life (QoL), avoid unnecessary surgical intervention and antibiotic therapy, and minimize the risk of adverse effects of treatment. Side effects of pharmacologic agents and their cost must be weighed against the knowledge that HIDS usually does not cause premature death or serious, permanent complications with the rare exception of amyloidosis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Goals of management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with HIDS, decisions regarding the management approach should involve the patient, when feasible, and the <span class=\"nowrap\">parents/caregivers</span>. After appropriate education, they, in conjunction with the treating clinician, must weigh the risks and benefits to determine their choice of therapy, which may include no therapy at all (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108431\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108431 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who opt for symptomatic management during febrile episodes, we suggest use of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) rather than an oral glucocorticoid as the initial agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For those who do not respond to an NSAID, we suggest a short course of an oral glucocorticoid for the predicted duration of an attack (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients who fail glucocorticoid therapy (or wish to avoid the potential side effects of glucocorticoids), we suggest episodic treatment with anakinra (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2538695876\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous therapy with a biologic agent is typically reserved for those rare patients with HIDS who develop amyloidosis. However, for patients who fail symptomatic therapy and still prefer treatment over observation due to more frequent and severe attacks that have a significant negative impact on QoL, prophylactic therapy with an anticytokine biologic agent is an option. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Etanercept</a>, anakinra, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=canakinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">canakinumab</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a> have all shown benefit at reducing attack frequency and duration, with newer agents showing better efficacy than the older ones in the limited data available. However, local side effects may limit a patient's tolerance of these therapies. In additional, these agents are associated with an increased risk of serious infections. Febrile episodes may be due to an infection rather than HIDS in patients on these therapies. Thus, clinicians should monitor patients accordingly. (See <a href=\"#H1052427167\" class=\"local\">'Preventive treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H170450048\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge E Richard Stiehm, MD, who contributed as a Section Editor to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-management/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Neven B, Valayannopoulos V, Quartier P, et al.
