The epidemiology and immunopathogenesis of JIA are reviewed here. Diagnostic criteria and nomenclature of JIA are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-juvenile-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of juvenile arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4186997\"><span class=\"h2\">Terminology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The older terms, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA, used commonly in the United States) and juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA, preferred in Europe), have been replaced by the term JIA. JIA incorporates all of what was called JRA in the past and also includes all other forms of &quot;idiopathic&quot; arthritis in childhood. The term JRA will still be used to describe the general patient population in older studies since JRA is a less inclusive term than JIA (the term JIA will be used for these older studies if a specific subgroup is specified [eg, systemic JIA]). However, most clinicians assume that the results of these earlier studies of JRA are generally applicable to all the categories included in JIA, although the precise numbers will be somewhat different. The JIA nomenclature should be regarded as a &quot;work in progress&quot; that will be refined as the genetic and pathophysiologic understanding of arthritis improves. All of the discussion of epidemiology and pathogenesis that follows is complicated by the fact that JIA is not a single disease, but several different diseases. While there are elements common to all of these diseases, some forms of JIA, such as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27-associated diseases and systemic JIA, are clearly distinct entities with differing etiologies and pathogenesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Overall incidence and prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lack of standard diagnostic criteria has complicated epidemiologic studies. When the revised American College of Rheumatology (ACR, formerly the ARA) classification criteria were applied to the Rochester Epidemiology Program Project database, an incidence of 13.9 cases of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) per 100,000 per year was reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A follow-up study, utilizing the same database, noted a decrease in incidence over a subsequent decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The results of other population studies are presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F78901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78901 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. In the Rochester study, the prevalence rate for JRA was 94 patients per 100,000 children on January 1, 1980 and 86 on January 1, 1990 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. An extrapolation to the entire United States population under 16 years of age in the year 2000 suggests that there must be 70,000 to 100,000 cases of JRA (active and inactive). However, the population in the Rochester study was predominantly Caucasian. The actual prevalence in the total United States population is probably much lower (15,000 to 36,000 in some estimates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]) because JRA appears to be less common in African-American and Asian populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Ethnic differences in prevalence have also been noted in other populations. As examples, the prevalence of JRA is less in blacks than in those of Indian ancestry among South African children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and is higher in the native population than among Caucasians among Canadian children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Differences in disease onset among ethnic groups have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. African-American children are more likely to have a polyarticular onset than Caucasian children, who most often have an oligoarticular onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Among Japanese children, systemic disease is more common than the oligoarticular form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Genetic factors are likely to contribute to these differences. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Age of onset</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a series from the United States, the peak incidence of JRA occurred at one to three years, with a preponderance of girls in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A second, less prominent peak was noted between ages 8 to 10 years; this peak included more boys with oligoarticular JIA. Other investigators have found a mean age of onset of approximately six years for both systemic and polyarticular disease; oligoarticular disease began at a mean age of approximately 4 years in girls and 10 years in boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Gender differences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most published series, the female:male ratio ranges from 2:1 to 3:1, although equal sex ratios have been described among Indian and black South African children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These ratios depend upon the age at onset and the type of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As an example, oligoarticular JIA affecting children under eight years old may have a female preponderance as high as 8:1, especially if iridocyclitis is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. In contrast, late-onset human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27-related disease occurs more commonly in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Systemic JIA shows little or no discrimination between sexes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Secular and seasonal variations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Substantial variations in JIA occurrence over extended (secular trends) and shorter (seasonal) periods have been noted in some populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. The possibility of an etiologic link was suggested by a report from the United Kingdom in which an influenza virus epidemic occurred prior to an &quot;outbreak&quot; of JIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The strongest seasonal variations have been observed with systemic JIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>], although this appears to be true only in some geographic regions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis and etiology of JIA are unclear. As with most autoimmune disorders, interactions among genetic factors, immune mechanisms, and environmental exposures are thought to contribute in most cases. Most of the genetic predisposition to JIA is determined by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci. Multiple MHC loci are associated with the development of JIA, and, in general, these associations are markedly distinct from those seen in adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The spectrum of non-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes that are associated with JIA is expanding rapidly, but their contribution to the risk of JIA appears to be less significant, and their effects may be shared between JIA and other autoimmune diseases including RA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Familial predisposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patterns of inheritance consistent with Mendelian or monogenic inheritance have not been observed in JIA. The level of risk to family members of a proband appears to be only mildly increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], and families with multiple affected members are uncommon. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, the juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) Affected Sib Pairs Research Registry in Cincinnati estimated the total number of affected sib pairs at 300 in a population of approximately 250 million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Almost 80 percent of the pairs and 100 percent of twin pairs were concordant for disease type. Among twins, disease onset was separated by a mean of approximately three months. In a subsequent study that included an additional 94 affected pairs, the mean difference in age of onset of non-twin pairs was approximately three years, and concordance of disease type was 73 percent for the two cohorts combined (120 of 164 non-twin affected sib pairs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Europe, only 12 affected sib pairs were found among over 3000 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p>Anecdotal evidence suggests that families with JRA probands have an increased risk of other nonrheumatic autoimmune diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Predisposing major histocompatibility complex genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple HLA loci are associated with the development of JIA, with specific disease subtypes being linked to specific HLA alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/27,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,33</a>]. Genes that do not encode classic HLA proteins but lie within the MHC may also predispose to JIA.

Disease susceptibility correlates with particular alleles of each serologically or cellularly defined specificity, such as HLA-DRB1*0801 of DR8 and HLA-DPB1*0201 of DPw2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Although most associations are with HLA class II, a consistent increase in risk with the HLA class I A2 allele has been reported in girls with early-onset oligoarticular JIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-leukocyte-antigens-hla-a-roadmap\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human leukocyte antigens (HLA): A roadmap&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to these findings, some HLA class II alleles occur with decreased frequency in affected children, suggesting a protective effect. Examples include HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Determination of HLA specificities using DNA-based methodologies has also better defined the genetic markers of disease outcome in early-onset oligoarticular JIA. Haplotypes carrying HLA-DRB*0801, HLA-DRB*1301, and HLA-DP*0201 alleles appear to predispose to oligoarticular JIA in general. In contrast, other alleles may contribute to the risk for other clinical manifestations. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HLA-DRB1*1104 predisposes to eye disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HLA-DQA1*0101 predisposes to evolution from oligoarticular to polyarticular, erosive disease but is associated with a reduced risk of eye disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HLA-DRB1*0101 has been associated with polyarticular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p>Whether the HLA-DQA*0101 or the HLA-DRB*0101 allele is a better marker for the haplotype is uncertain, but there are data that are compatible with either possibility.</p><p>The fact that HLA genes from four loci (HLA-A, HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP) are involved in inherited predisposition to oligoarticular JIA raises the possibility that these genes make up a potential susceptibility haplotype. However, the absence of linkage disequilibrium between these genes indicates that there are independent genetic effects at three loci. This is illustrated in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72340\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72340 \">table 2</a>), which demonstrates the odds ratio obtained by the cumulative addition of risk factors. Such interactions have been demonstrated in other populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>In a significant proportion of patients with early-onset oligoarticular JIA, especially those with uveitis, the development of the disease may be associated with the presence of two susceptibility alleles of either the HLA-DR or HLA-DQ loci. Patients who are heterozygous for <span class=\"nowrap\">HLA-DR5/HLA-DR8</span> have a particularly increased risk for developing eye disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. An HLA-DP gene and the class I HLA-A2 gene also contribute, appearing as independent risk factors. Class II gene homozygosity is not increased in the oligoarticular JIA patient population, suggesting that a dosage effect of any individual gene does not increase risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Other types</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HLA associations with clinical forms other than early-onset oligoarticular JIA are less strong. In addition to the previously mentioned increased risk of late-onset oligoarticular JIA associated with HLA-B27 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>], the following associations have been reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyarticular, rheumatoid factor (RF)-negative JIA susceptibility with HLA-DPw3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RF-positive, polyarticular JIA has the same HLA-DR4 associations as does adult RA: HLA-DRB1*0401 and HLA-DRB1*0101 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

However, the shared epitope hypothesis as applied to adults is not useful for oligoarticular JIA, in which HLA-DR4 is protective and HLA-DR1 haplotypes predispose to a polyarticular outcome. Similarly, patients with seronegative polyarticular JIA do not carry the appropriate epitopes. The only JIA group in which the shared epitope hypothesis may hold is in older children with polyarticular disease who are immunoglobulin M (IgM) RF positive. These patients have the childhood equivalent of adult RA; they represent fewer than 10 percent of all patients with JIA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HLA and other susceptibility genes in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Individual alleles and the shared epitope'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Age-specific effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is new evidence that some genes operative in JIA appear to have a &quot;window-of-effect,&quot; during which time they may contribute risk of disease but be neutral or even protective at other times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. This appears to be particularly true in the oligoarticular groups, in which HLA-related risks clearly differ with age. For example, 50 percent of children carrying at least one of the susceptibility MHC alleles have disease onset prior to their third birthday, suggesting that the period of susceptibility to early-onset oligoarticular JIA is limited to the first years of life. In contrast, HLA-B27 and DR-4 appear to be associated with the protection against early-onset oligoarticular JIA early in life but with the increased risk for other forms of JIA later in childhood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F79342\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79342 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Predisposing non-HLA genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasing evidence supports the concept that the occurrence of JIA and its phenotype is determined by complex genetic traits with &quot;genetic interplay&quot; between HLA and non-HLA predisposing alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The spectrum of non-HLA genes that may be associated with JIA is expanding rapidly, as illustrated in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79960 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/19,36,54-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,36,54-66</a>]. However, their contribution to the risk of JIA appears to be less significant than that of HLA genes, and their effects may not be specific to JIA. In general, the odds ratios are low, and distinguishing between founder effects (the incomplete mixing of genetically disparate populations) and associations that relate to pathogenesis has been difficult. Reproducible associations with odds ratios greater than two have been noted with interleukin-6 (IL-6) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) promoter polymorphisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. The IL-6 promoter (-174G) allele is significantly associated with systemic disease in children older than the age of five years but not in younger children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>The use of genetic markers, such as microsatellite polymorphisms, suggests the presence of other, as yet unknown genes, which are associated with JIA. As an example, the marker D6S265*5, which is in proximity to, but distinct from, the HLA-A locus, is more commonly found in Norwegian children with seronegative forms of JIA than controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>Initial genome-wide scanning using polymorphic markers on all the chromosomes in 121 families with a pair of affected children has confirmed the linkage of JIA to the HLA region on chromosome 6 and identified several other sites of interest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Evidence for linkage to sites on chromosome 1, 19, and 20 was noted. When affected children were stratified by the type of disease onset, evidence of linkage was found at different chromosomal locations (eg, early-onset polyarticular and oligoarticular disease with chromosomes 7 and 19, respectively), and, when children carrying the HLA-DR8 allele were selected, strong evidence of linkage to a site on chromosome 2 was noted.</p><p>Additional loci and genes associated with JIA have been identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of RA, including IL-2 receptor alpha (<em>IL2RA</em>), protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor-type 2 (<em>PTPN2</em>), <em>PTPN22</em>, signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (<em>STAT4</em>), angiopoietin 1 (<em>ANGPT1</em>), and component of oligomeric Golgi complex 6 (<em>COG6</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>]. The latter study also found associations with loci at 3q13 and 10q21 that may be unique to JIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Dense mapping of suspected loci in 2816 patients with oligoarticular or polyarticular JIA confirmed associations with the HLA region, <em>PTPN2</em>, <em>PTPN22</em>, <em>STAT4</em>, <em>IL2RA</em>, and <em>COG6 </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

In addition, enzymes released by inflammatory cells within the synovium or synovial fluid may result in degradation of the collagen and proteoglycan matrix of the articular cartilage. Activation of osteoclasts resulting from the production of cytokines by cells within the mass of inflammatory tissue is probably the final pathway of juxta-articular bone demineralization and bone erosions.</p><p>While some mechanisms of disease are likely shared by children with JIA and adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), there may be some that are unique to childhood disease.

The relative response of T regulatory and T-helper cells was also measured by comparing cytokine production of IL-10 (immunosuppressive cytokine) to interferon (IFN)-gamma (proinflammatory cytokine). Only patients with active oligoarticular JIA produced increased levels of IL-10 compared with IFN-gamma. These results suggest that, in patients with active oligoarticular JIA, there is a greater response in the T regulatory cells than in T helper cells.</p><p/><p>One interpretation of these data is that upregulation of the T regulatory cells in patients with oligoarticular JIA decreases inflammation, leading to less severe disease in these patients compared with those with polyarticular JIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/140,141\" class=\"abstract_t\">140,141</a>].

Thus, a Th1 cytokine response may be disease promoting. Consistent with this notion, one study showed that higher levels of IFN-gamma and a strong IFN-induced transcriptional signature in synovial fluid mononuclear cells were predictive of progression from oligoarticular to polyarticular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>].</p><p>Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-10, may be produced as well.

IL-10 is more consistently found in JRA tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. Preliminary evidence suggests that at least some of these cytokines are derived from the immunoregulatory T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/137,145\" class=\"abstract_t\">137,145</a>], which are found in the CD25+ T cell population in both peripheral blood and synovial compartments.</p><p>T cells infiltrating the inflamed synovium in children with JIA may have a skewed cytokine phenotype, which may be due to selective recruitment of cells expressing chemokine receptors characteristic of Th1 cells. This hypothesis is supported by the demonstration of enrichment of synovial fluid lymphocytes for T cells expressing chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3, which are markers for the Th1 phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/146,147\" class=\"abstract_t\">146,147</a>].

IL-17+ T cells were increased in the joints of children with JIA compared with levels in the blood of JIA patients and controls and were also demonstrated in synovial tissue. IL-17+ T cell numbers were higher in patients with extended oligoarthritis compared with patients with persistent oligoarthritis. Within the joint, there was an inverse relationship between IL-17+ T cells and forkhead box P3-positive (FoxP3+) regulatory T (Treg) cells. A higher proportion of Th17 cells is also seen in the peripheral blood of patients with systemic JIA compared with normal controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural killer cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Natural killer (NK) cells in JIA have been assessed in several studies with somewhat contradictory results.

The pattern of distribution of TNF-alpha staining is similar in nature to the pattern observed with CD68 staining. The level of expression of TNF-alpha correlates closely with the degree of inflammatory infiltration of synovia.</p><p>High levels of TNF expression are associated with wide distribution of TNF receptors in the vast majority of tissues. As an example, staining with antibodies specific for the p55 and p75 TNF receptors revealed that cells with diverse morphology expressed TNF receptors on their surfaces. Higher numbers of positive cells were observed in the areas of cellular aggregates adjacent to synovial venules, with the most intense staining seen on the endothelial cells lining the synovial blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. Serum levels of the soluble forms of both the p55 and p75 TNF receptors are elevated in the majority of children with active systemic JIA but only in minority of those with polyarticular or oligoarticular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>].</p><p>Activated lymphocytes from peripheral blood of children with JRA adhere to vascular endothelial cells stimulated with TNF-alpha in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. In vivo, this would be expected to lead to the extravasation of such cells and their accumulation at the site of inflammation. These observations suggest that one of the mechanisms by which TNF-alpha amplifies inflammation in JIA is its ability to promote trafficking of the inflammatory cells from peripheral circulation into synovium.</p><p>The proinflammatory role of TNF-alpha in rheumatoid disease does not appear to be limited to only synovium. TNF-alpha is a major proinflammatory cytokine with both local and systemic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/159\" class=\"abstract_t\">159</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At low concentrations, it acts locally, mostly as a paracrine and autocrine regulator of leukocytes and vascular endothelial cells.

The beneficial clinical experience with anti-TNF-alpha treatment strategies supports a critical role of TNF-alpha in both local and systemic features of pauci- and polyarticular JIA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and complications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment#H15849649\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Biologic therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Surprisingly, the same strategy appears to be less effective in the systemic form of JIA. Preliminary clinical experience, however, suggests that patients with systemic JIA may show a much better response to therapy directed toward IL-1 or IL-6. In fact, good clinical response to the inhibition of IL-6 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> IL-1 in systemic JIA is similar to that seen in autoinflammatory diseases with a known genetic cause, such as neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease, in which the inflammatory response is triggered by the abnormalities in the innate immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/156\" class=\"abstract_t\">156</a>]. It has been suggested that the role of the adaptive immune response in systemic JIA may be rather limited compared with the other clinical forms of JIA.

Weak staining for deposits of C3b, C3dg, and the membrane attack complex has also been noted. However, no association was noted between clinical activity and the degree of complement activation. This may in part be due to complement activation by C-reactive protein, a process that is not antigen specific, rather than by immune complexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/193\" class=\"abstract_t\">193</a>].

In this disease, there is activation of the vascular endothelium with expression of leucocyte adhesion molecules (E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1), subsequent recruitment of neutrophils, and monocytes, and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6) and S100 proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/194\" class=\"abstract_t\">194</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Recruitment of cells into synovium'</a> above and <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Macrophages/fibroblasts'</a> above and <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Neutrophils'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29719575\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lack of standard diagnostic criteria for juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA; which includes the previous grouping of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis [JRA] or juvenile chronic arthritis [JCA]) has complicated epidemiologic studies, including the determination of incidence and prevalence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F78901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78901 \">table 1</a>). JIA appears to be less common in African-American and Asian populations in the United States. In most populations, the female-to-male ratio ranges from 2:1 to 3:1. However, these ratios depend upon the age at onset and the type of the disease. The peak incidence is one to three years of age, although this varies depending upon gender and type of disease. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis and etiology of JIA are unclear. As with most autoimmune disorders, interactions among genetic factors, immune mechanisms, and environmental exposures are thought to contribute in most cases. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patterns of inheritance consistent with Mendelian or monogenic inheritance have not been observed in JIA. The level of risk to family members of a proband appears to be only mildly increased in most cases. Multiple human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci are associated with the development of JIA, with specific disease subtypes being linked to specific HLA alleles. Patients with early-onset oligoarticular JIA, which has a relatively high concordance among siblings, constitute the subtype with the most distinctive HLA associations. Some genes operative in JIA appear to have a &quot;window-of-effect,&quot; during which time they may contribute risk of disease but be neutral or even protective at other times. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Predisposing major histocompatibility complex genes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major clinical manifestation of JIA is persistent joint swelling that results from the combination of synovial fluid accumulation and synovial thickening. Such swelling may cause deformities of affected joints due to stretching of periarticular ligaments and tendons. In addition, enzymes released by inflammatory cells within the synovium or synovial fluid may result in degradation of the collagen and proteoglycan matrix of the articular cartilage. Activation of osteoclasts resulting from the production of cytokines by cells within the mass of inflammatory tissue is probably the final pathway of juxtaarticular bone demineralization and bone erosions. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Pathobiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of the pathologic hallmarks of JIA is the tumor-like expansion of inflamed synovial tissue, or pannus, which causes much of the joint damage. Pannus results from the proliferation of synoviocytes and invasion of the synovial tissue by inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, recruited from the peripheral circulation. Infiltration into the synovium depends upon the interplay of vascular factors, cytokines, adhesion molecules, and chemokines. Various inflammatory cells are also found in the synovial fluid. As the disease progresses, pannus spreads over the synovial space and adheres to intraarticular cartilage. It is in the areas of pannus-cartilage junction where the cartilage eventually degrades.
