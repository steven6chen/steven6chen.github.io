Persistence of these sinusoids may lead to coronary artery cameral fistulae. As the myocardium becomes more compact, the sinusoids disappear and give rise to a network of veins, arteries, and capillaries (at approximately 32 days of gestation) that may have connections with other mediastinal vessels. Persistence of these connections may lead to coronary artery fistulae. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Persistent sinusoids'</a> below.)</p><p>As the coronary artery network evolves, endothelial buds arise from the base of the truncus arteriosus. It is still unknown if initially there are only two buds, or buds from each potential cusp of the aortic and pulmonary sinuses (six buds) with later involution of all but two buds. These buds later grow and join the coronary artery network that develops from the sinusoids to establish the definitive coronary artery system. Abnormal involution (in the case of six initial buds), bud position, or septation of the truncus arteriosus may lead to the development of an abnormal origin of the coronary arteries.</p><p>Given this complex embryology, it is expected that deviations in development may result in various (&quot;abnormal&quot;) origins of the coronary arteries from the normal sinuses of Valsalva in the aorta or from the pulmonary artery. Some of these variations may have no clinical importance while others are clearly pathologic. These variations can be associated with underlying congenital heart defects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">VARIATIONS OF CORONARY ARTERY ORIGIN FROM THE AORTA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In otherwise normal patients, there may be variations in the number, shape, and location of the ostia or origins of the coronary arteries. Most of these variations appear to be of no clinical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], although a high origin of the ostia may reduce diastolic coronary artery blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Separate origins of the right coronary artery (RCA) and its conal branch occur in 50 percent of the population and separate origins of the left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) and left anterior descending artery (LAD) in 1 percent.</p><p>More important lesions include origin of the left main coronary artery or LAD from the right sinus of Valsalva or RCA, referred to as anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery (AAOCA). The subsequent course between the aorta and pulmonary artery to the left ventricle may result in compression of the vessel, myocardial ischemia, and sudden death in both adults and teenagers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Alternatively, it may be the intramural course and acute angle of takeoff that may predispose to obstruction to blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In one study, the length of the intramural course was found to correlate with symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Complications<strong> </strong>commonly occur during or immediately after exercise, though sudden death may occur without prior symptoms. It has been proposed that exercise leads to expansion of the aortic root and pulmonary trunk, which, in addition to external coronary artery compression, may increase the pre-existing angulation of the coronary artery takeoff, reducing the luminal diameter in the proximal portion of the coronary artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Similarly, a single coronary artery originating from the right sinus of Valsalva may result in compression of the LAD or its branches via the same mechanism. Origin of the RCA from the left sinus of Valsalva or LAD also can lead to myocardial ischemia and sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In contrast, origin of the LCx from the RCA is generally felt to be of no clinical significance due to its posterior course to the left ventricle. However, it is possible that vascular compression can occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of abnormal aortic origin of the coronary arteries is low with reported values of approximately 0.64 percent of births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and 0.17 percent in asymptomatic children and adolescents who were referred for and underwent echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The most common anomaly is the left circumflex from the right sinus of Valsalva, followed by a single coronary artery from the left sinus of Valsalva, both coronary arteries from the right sinus of Valsalva, and the LAD from the right sinus of Valsalva. The prevalence of either the right coronary artery arising from the left sinus of Valsalva or the left main coronary artery arising from the right sinus of Valsalva is between 0.1 and 0.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The prevalence of the RCA arising from the left sinus of Valsalva is greater than the left coronary artery from the right sinus of Valsalva, 0.17 percent versus 0.047 percent though both are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of a patient with the above mentioned abnormalities may be anginal chest pain, or syncope, especially with exercise. Unfortunately, the first clinical symptom may be sudden death, particularly in young athletes and military recruits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. In a registry of sudden death in 286 competitive athletes under age 35 in whom cardiovascular disease was shown to be the cause at autopsy, an anomalous coronary artery of wrong sinus origin was responsible for 13 percent of cases, being second in frequency to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a series of autopsies in military recruits, an anomalous coronary artery was the most frequent cause of sudden cardiac death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Athletes: Risk of sudden cardiac death&quot;</a>.) Overall, the incidence of sudden death in patients with AAOCA is low, though higher for patients with AAOCA of the left coronary artery than with AAOCA of the RCA, especially in the absence of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical examination and diagnostic studies are usually unrevealing in the absence of myocardial infarction or symptoms of ongoing ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/3,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16</a>]. When anomalous origin of a coronary artery is suspected, echocardiography may establish the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, noninvasive coronary magnetic resonance angiography (CMRA) is increasingly used to define anomalous coronary anatomy. Coronary angiography, which was the historical gold standard for the evaluation of the origin and course of the coronary arteries, is still recommended when other studies are not diagnostic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The ability of CMRA to reliably identify the proximal course of the major coronary arteries and the desire to minimize radiation exposure makes this an ideal procedure to image young adults with suspected coronary anomalies. Coronary angiography by computed tomography is a noninvasive alternative to CMRA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-coronary-imaging-with-cardiac-computed-tomography-and-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive coronary imaging with cardiac computed tomography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The efficacy of CMRA has been evaluated in a number of small studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. The following observations illustrate the typical findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of 19 patients with anomalous coronary arteries in whom CMRA and conventional radiograph coronary angiography were performed, there was close agreement in findings with the two tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In the three cases in which the two modalities disagreed, the CMRA gave a clearer result than the radiograph image.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 16 patients with anomalous coronaries, CMRA had a sensitivity of 88 percent, and a specificity of 100 percent using the radiograph image as the gold standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. It was suggested that the combination of the two studies improves the definition of the course of the proximal anomalous artery: CMRA provides better spatial relationships, while conventional coronary angiography permits a view of the entire length of the artery and its peripheral runoff.</p><p/><p>Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) can be performed with electron beam or multidetector row (multislice) scanners; the latter are much more widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. The potential efficacy of CCTA was illustrated in a study of 17 patients who were referred because of equivocal findings at cardiac catheterization or echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Multidetector row CCTA provided an accurate depiction of the origin and course of 20 anomalous arteries in these patients.</p><p>In general, with the rapid refinement of both CMRA and CCTA, most coronary artery abnormalities can be imaged equally well; one modality may be better than the other for a time pending refinements in which it is equaled or bested by the other. The major considerations in choosing one or the other include time (CMRA taking longer than a CCTA, though the difference is becoming less as CMRA becomes faster), radiation used for CCTA, and the contraindication to CMRA in some patients because of implanted devices and metal objects. </p><p>Other imaging studies may be of some benefit. Stress studies (echocardiography or radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging) may aid in the management of coronary artery variations, including a superior location of the coronary ostia, if it is unclear whether there is a risk of ischemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical intervention is indicated for coronary artery abnormalities in symptomatic patients with AAOCA (particularly with origin of the left coronary artery from the right sinus), such as those with serious ventricular tachyarrhythmias or documented myocardial ischemia. There are no controlled studies that have evaluated the outcome of intervention in asymptomatic individuals.</p><p>The indications for intervention in asymptomatic patients with AAOCA with an intramural course are debated, especially with AAOCA RCA from the left sinus of Valsalva [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/10,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15</a>]. Our authors and reviewers generally refer asymptomatic patients with left coronary artery arising from the right coronary sinus for surgical repair.</p><p>Asymptomatic patients with the right coronary artery arising from the left sinus are managed on a case by case basis by our authors and reviewers, with factors such as surgical risk, longevity, and patient preference taken into account. Factors that might be taken into account in the decision regarding prophylactic surgery might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The finding of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia found on screening with stress testing in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, in one study, it was found that signs of ischemia on stress testing were higher postoperatively than preoperatively, especially patients with a RCA from the left sinus of Valsalva [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2011 study reported on the medium-term results after surgical repair in 50 patients with AAOCA, 31 of whom had the RCA originating from the left sinus of valsalva. There was no operative mortality and there were no deaths with an average duration of flow-up of 5.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p>The prevalence of AAOCA without an intramural course is not known, in part due to the lack of study of this issue using high resolution imaging techniques. Based on anecdotal information, an intramural course of the coronary artery is likely in all cases of AAOCA, but the length of the intramural course may vary.</p><p>Surgical interventions can consist of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or unroofing (marsupialization) of the coronary artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] to prevent compression from a change in the angulation. The &ldquo;hinge-twist&rdquo; procedure has been described for AAOCA without an intramural course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], and a pulmonary artery translocation technique has been described for a single coronary ostium without an intramural course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Intracoronary stents have also been used as an alternative to CABG in symptomatic patients with ischemia; their structural rigidity may protect the vessel against compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Association with other congenital heart diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Variations in origin of the coronary arteries from the aorta are commonly seen with congenital heart diseases such as tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great arteries, double outlet right ventricle, univentricular hearts, and truncus arteriosus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Tetralogy of Fallot</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anomalous origin of the coronary arteries occurs in approximately 9 percent of patients with tetralogy of Fallot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. The most common variations are an enlarged conal artery, an anomalous LAD arising from the RCA or right sinus of Valsalva, and a single coronary artery. These variations are important to recognize for surgical repair, as the coronary arteries may be vulnerable to injury during right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-outcome-of-tetralogy-of-fallot\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and outcome of tetralogy of Fallot&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Transposition of the great arteries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of coronary anomalies are seen in patients with D-transposition of the great arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common, occurring in about 60 percent of patients, is origin of the RCA from the posterior aspect of the right-facing sinus of Valsalva and the left main coronary artery from the posterior aspect of the left-facing sinus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The next most common abnormality, seen in about 20 percent, is an LCx arising from the RCA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other lesions, each occurring in 3 to 9 percent of patients, include coronary artery inversion (ie, the RCA arising from the left posterior sinus of Valsalva and the left main coronary artery arising from the right posterior sinus of Valsalva), inversion of the coronary arteries with the LCx artery arising from the RCA, and single coronary artery, arising from either the right or left sinus of Valsalva.</p><p/><p>An intramural rather than epicardial course of any of the coronary arteries may be seen in D-transposition. Since coronary artery reimplantation is part of the repair of D-transposition of the great arteries, knowledge of the coronary artery pattern is important.</p><p>In L-transposition of the great arteries, there is confusion in the nomenclature of the coronary arteries, since they may be named for the sinus of Valsalva from which they originate or the ventricle that they supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/1,35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,35-38</a>]. Using the convention of naming from the sinus of origin, the RCA supplies the right-sided left ventricle and branches into an LCx and LAD branch the way a left coronary artery usually does. The left coronary artery takes a course similar to the usual RCA in the interventricular groove.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Truncus arteriosus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In truncus arteriosus, the usual coronary artery pattern is present unless more than three cusps are present. In this setting, variations can occur, which may lead to injury during surgical procedures, including coronary arteries that course over the anterior surface of the right ventricle (predisposing to coronary artery injury during surgical procedures), a single coronary artery, or displacement of the coronary ostia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Other congenital heart defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other congenital heart defects, such as a univentricular heart, have coronary artery patterns similar to those described above depending upon the relationship of the great arteries to each other and the outflow chambers. The coronary artery variations may be diagnosed prior to surgery with echocardiography or ultrafast CT in some centers, although angiography remains the gold standard.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of the above variations depends upon the exact nature of the lesion. Many of the variations, especially if the origin is from the aorta, do not require surgical correction if there is no evidence for ongoing or predicted development of myocardial ischemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">VARIATIONS OF CORONARY ARTERY ORIGIN FROM THE PULMONARY ARTERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An anomalous origin of one or more coronary arteries from the pulmonary artery is usually an isolated abnormality, occurring in 0.4 percent of patients with congenital cardiac abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62373\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62373 \">image 1</a>). Such lesions are hemodynamically significant and produce myocardial ischemia that may be progressive and lead to ischemic cardiomyopathy. The following mechanisms may be involved:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The myocardium is perfused by the abnormally arising coronary artery, which has a relatively low perfusion pressure and carries blood with a low oxygen saturation, reflecting the pulmonary artery source.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the presence of collateral circulation from a normally arising coronary artery, there will be coronary artery steal, as flow will be directed from the normal coronary artery to the pulmonary artery, ie, a left to right shunt, via the collateral vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p/><p>The most common defect of this type is origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery, sometimes known as Bland-White-Garland syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. In some cases, the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex coronary artery coronary arteries have individual origins from the pulmonary artery, with similar pathophysiologic and clinical sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. The origin of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery has been thought to be benign; however, clinical sequelae have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation varies with the coronary artery involved and its myocardial distribution, the pulmonary vascular resistance, and the number and size of collateral vessels.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Without significant collateral blood supply, myocardial ischemia in the region supplied by the abnormal coronary artery will occur in infancy when the neonatal elevated pulmonary vascular resistance normalizes. With the onset of ischemia, myocardial function deteriorates with the associated signs and symptoms of heart failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;</a>.) In neonates, angina may manifest as irritability, pallor, and diaphoresis, with progression to signs and symptoms of shock. These findings usually become apparent at four to six weeks of age when the pulmonary vascular resistance has decreased, though the presentation may be delayed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With good collateral blood flow, the presentation of this abnormality may be delayed to later childhood, teen, or even adult age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-collateral-circulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary collateral circulation&quot;</a>.)

A continuous murmur resembling a patent ductus arteriosus, with flow from the aorta to the pulmonary circulation, may be noted, reflecting flow through collaterals.

The electrocardiogram of an infant with an anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery shows evidence for anterolateral ischemia or infarction, including transient or chronic ST-segment changes in the anterolateral leads or Q waves in leads I avL, V5, and V6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, 20 to 45 percent of patients do not have abnormal Q waves.

The following are important points made in this topic:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of abnormal aortic origin of the coronary arteries is low, with reported values of approximately 0.64 percent of births and 0.17 percent in asymptomatic children and adolescents who were referred for and underwent echocardiography. The most common anomaly is the left circumflex from the right sinus of Valsalva, followed by a single coronary artery from the left sinus of Valsalva, both coronary arteries from the right sinus of Valsalva, and the left anterior descending from the right sinus of Valsalva. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Variations of coronary artery origin from the aorta'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Separate origins of the right coronary artery and its conal branch occur in 50 percent of the population and separate origins of the left circumflex coronary artery and left anterior descending artery in 1 percent. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Variations of coronary artery origin from the aorta'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variations in origin of the coronary arteries from the aorta are commonly seen with congenital heart diseases such as tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great arteries, double outlet right ventricle, univentricular hearts, and truncus arteriosus. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Association with other congenital heart diseases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic origin of the left coronary artery from the right sinus of Valsalva may result in ischemia and sudden death. A single coronary artery originating from the right sinus of Valsalva may result in ischemia from a similar mechanism. The clinical presentation of a patient with these abnormalities may be anginal chest pain, or syncope, especially with exercise. Unfortunately, the first clinical symptom may be sudden death, particularly in young athletes and military recruits. However, management of asymptomatic individuals is still under investigation. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Variations of coronary artery origin from the aorta'</a> above.)<br/><br/>While coronary angiography is the &ldquo;gold standard,&rdquo; computed tomograph angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is becoming more frequently used.<br/><br/>Surgical intervention is indicated for coronary artery abnormalities associated with serious ventricular tachyarrhythmias or myocardial ischemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An anomalous origin of one or more coronary arteries from the pulmonary artery is usually an isolated abnormality, occurring in 0.4 percent of patients with congenital cardiac abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62373\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62373 \">image 1</a>). Such lesions are hemodynamically significant and produce myocardial ischemia that may be progressive and lead to ischemic cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Variations of coronary artery origin from the pulmonary artery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormalities in the caliber of the coronary arteries include narrowing due to stenosis or hypoplasia or enlargement, including ectasia or aneurysmal dilatation. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Abnormalities in the caliber of the coronary arteries'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Communications between the coronary arteries and the cardiac chambers (coronary-cameral fistulae) or other vessels (coronary artery arteriovenous malformations) are often due to deviations from normal embryological development. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) They may also be acquired from trauma (stab, gunshot, or projectile injuries), or from invasive cardiac procedures such as pacemaker implantation, endomyocardial biopsy, or coronary angiography. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Coronary artery fistulae'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4073138062\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The UpToDate editorial staff would like to thank Dr. Thomas P.
