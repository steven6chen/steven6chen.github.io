Chronic heavy or prolonged uterine bleeding can result in anemia, interfere with daily activities, and raise concerns about uterine cancer. AUB is a common reason for referral to a gynecologist, and 5 percent of women between the ages of 30 and 49 years consult a clinician for evaluation of menorrhagia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Iron deficiency anemia develops in 21 to 67 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p>Most women with chronic AUB require medical attention but can be managed in an outpatient setting. Occasionally, an exacerbation of chronic AUB is severe enough to necessitate emergency medical care.</p><p>The management of chronic AUB in nonpregnant premenopausal women will be reviewed here. The general evaluation of AUB, acute uterine bleeding, bleeding during pregnancy, and postmenopausal bleeding are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Managing an episode of severe or prolonged uterine bleeding&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-etiology-and-evaluation-of-vaginal-bleeding-in-pregnant-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the etiology and evaluation of vaginal bleeding in pregnant women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postmenopausal uterine bleeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A revised terminology system for AUB in nongravid reproductive-age women was introduced in 2011 by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This was the result of an international consensus process with the goal of avoiding poorly defined or confusing terms used previously (eg, menorrhagia, menometrorrhagia, oligomenorrhea). The classification system is referred to by the acronym PALM-COEIN (polyp, adenomyosis, leiomyoma, malignancy and hyperplasia, coagulopathy, ovulatory dysfunction, endometrial, iatrogenic, and not yet classified) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F90483\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90483 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abnormal uterine bleeding in reproductive-age women: Terminology and PALM-COEIN etiology classification&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the PALM-COEIN system, the term heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) refers to cyclic (ovulatory) menses that are heavy or prolonged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It does not refer to heavy or prolonged bleeding that occurs in women with ovulatory dysfunction (AUB-O). The term HMB replaces the term menorrhagia, which was previously used to describe heavy or prolonged uterine bleeding. Menorrhagia is a less precise word because it does not differentiate between volume and duration of bleeding or between cyclic and anovulatory bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23276300\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AUB encompasses a heterogeneous group of conditions with diverse etiologies. Initial management usually consists of progestin-based treatments including combination oral contraceptives, the 52 mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device with an initial release rate of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> for five years <span class=\"nowrap\">(LNg52/5;</span> Mirena), and high-dose progestin-only oral medications. Surgical treatment plays an important role in some women with AUB, particularly those who have structural lesions (eg, leiomyomas, endometrial polyps) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have completed childbearing. Prior to initiating management, women with AUB should undergo evaluation for endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma, if appropriate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58600 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women#H16090927\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age women&quot;, section on 'Endometrial sampling'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3003347\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Types of chronic AUB and indications for treatment include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) </strong>&ndash; HMB is ovulatory (cyclic), heavy bleeding. HMB should be treated when it interferes with quality of life or causes anemia. The impact on quality of life in women with HMB includes the need to change pads or tampons frequently, heavy bleeding that stains clothing or bedding, and avoidance of activities due to bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women#H196197\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age women&quot;, section on 'Heavy menstrual bleeding'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intermenstrual bleeding</strong> &ndash; Intermenstrual bleeding occurs in between otherwise regular menses. The primary etiology can often be identified and treated (eg, endometrial polyp, chronic endometritis). An evaluation should be performed to identify the etiology and exclude malignancy. If no etiology is found, the goal of treatment is to resolve this bothersome symptom. The volume of blood loss is typically small, and anemia is not generally a concern. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ovulatory dysfunction (AUB-O)</strong> &ndash; AUB-O is irregular, nonovulatory (noncyclic) bleeding. Although bleeding may be infrequent (oligomenorrhea) in some women with AUB-O, prolonged or heavy bleeding, even hemorrhage, may occur. The etiology of AUB-O should be identified, since treatment of some etiologies (eg, thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia) may restore cyclic menses. In many cases, polycystic ovarian syndrome is the etiology. The goals of treatment of AUB-O are to establish a regular bleeding pattern (or amenorrhea), prevent heavy bleeding, and prevent development of endometrial <span class=\"nowrap\">hyperplasia/cancer</span>. In addition, women with ovulatory dysfunction often require fertility treatment if they wish to conceive.

Empiric treatment without evaluation may miss a primary etiology that may be corrected or mask symptoms of neoplastic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>AUB symptoms may persist until menopause. The goal of initial therapy is to control the bleeding, treat anemia (if present), and restore quality of life. Once this has been accomplished, some women are satisfied with continuing chronic medical therapy, while others desire a treatment that requires less maintenance or is definitive. The approach to treatment is generally stepwise:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary etiology should be treated, if possible. This includes endocrine or infectious disorders that are treated medically (eg, polycystic ovarian syndrome or chronic endometritis) as well as structural lesions that are resectable via hysteroscopy (endometrial polyp, submucosal fibroid).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial approach in women with chronic AUB is usually pharmacologic treatment. The choice of medication depends upon the factors listed above. For some women who desire long-acting contraception, the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> is used as first-line therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary approaches are used for women who fail or cannot tolerate medical therapy or who prefer treatment options that do not require frequent dosing. Primary deciding factors are whether the patient is planning future childbearing and the level of invasiveness and risk associated with the procedure.</p><p/><p>Women often choose surgical therapy after long-term medical therapy. A systematic review of eight randomized trials of women with heavy menstrual bleeding found that 58 percent of women randomly assigned to medical treatment underwent surgery by two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>As an example, one randomized trial assigned 63 women with persistent AUB (median duration four years) who were dissatisfied with cyclic oral medroxyprogesterone treatment to undergo hysterectomy (route per provider) or expanded medical therapy, primarily with cyclic oral contraceptives (OCs) and a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) (alternative estrogen-progestin regimens were also employed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. By 18 months, 53 percent of women in the medical treatment group had asked for and received a hysterectomy (median interval to crossing over was six months). At two years, mean resource use in the medical management and hysterectomy arms were $4479 and $6777, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Broken down to resource use by treatment actually received, the costs for medication only, medicine followed by hysterectomy, and hysterectomy only were $2595, $6128, and $7024, respectively.</p><p>The choice of surgery may be based upon avoidance of medication-related side effects. In the systematic review, at four-month follow-up, endometrial resection was significantly more effective than oral medication in controlling bleeding (odds ratio [OR] 10.6, 95% CI 5.3 to 21.3) and significantly less likely to cause side effects (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Hysterectomy resulted in significantly greater improvements in mental health at six-month follow-up. </p><p>In general, HMB may be treated with either surgical or medical treatment. In contrast, AUB-O is a medical disease and should be treated medically in the majority of cases. However, some women with chronic AUB-O prefer definitive therapy and choose hysterectomy.</p><p>Some women with AUB will choose the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span>. This provides reversible contraception but can be left in place for up to five years and over time results in decreasing volume of bleeding until the patient has scant bleeding or amenorrhea. Other women with AUB may choose minimally invasive surgery or definitive treatment with hysterectomy. </p><p>Women with leiomyomas can also be treated with fibroid-specific minimally invasive procedures (eg, hysteroscopic myomectomy, uterine artery embolization) or major surgery (abdominal myomectomy). These procedures are listed below, but treatment of leiomyomas is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment of uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3267366119\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF THE PRIMARY ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of certain underlying conditions before initiating other therapy may correct the bleeding or make further treatment more effective. These include structural lesions or etiologies that can be treated pharmacologically. </p><p>This includes structural lesions. Submucosal fibroids and endometrial polyps can be resected via operative hysteroscopy. Arteriovenous malformations can be treated with interventional radiology procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-polyps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial polyps&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interventional radiology in management of gynecological disorders&quot;, section on 'Arteriovenous malformation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-myomectomy-and-other-laparoscopic-treatments-for-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids#H432924\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic myomectomy and other laparoscopic treatments for uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)&quot;, section on 'Myolysis'</a>.) </p><p>AUB due to infection in women with suspected or documented chronic endometritis often resolved following a course of antibiotics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometritis-unrelated-to-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometritis unrelated to pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Anovulatory bleeding is caused by endocrine abnormalities, and some etiologies (eg, hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia) can be treated to restore regular ovulatory cycles, whereas others (eg, polycystic ovarian syndrome) are best treated to regulate or eliminate bleeding episodes and prevent endometrial cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary hypothyroidism in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When possible, bleeding diatheses should be controlled prior to initiating other therapy. Most bleeding diatheses can be treated medically to reduce menstrual blood loss; options include administration of a hemostatic agent or one of the nonspecific therapies described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of von Willebrand disease&quot;, section on 'Excessive menstrual bleeding'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3267365790\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL APPROACH: MEDICAL THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical therapy is appropriate initial treatment for most women. If treatment must be continued long-term, some women will prefer a management option that does not require frequent dosing (eg, levonorgestrel-releasing [20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day]</span> intrauterine device <span class=\"nowrap\">[LNg52/5</span> IUD; Mirena] or surgery). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3089136802\"><span class=\"h2\">Heavy menstrual bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common etiologies of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) are uterine leiomyomas or adenomyosis. Although these conditions may be treated with surgery, medical management represents appropriate initial treatment and indeed, many patients prefer initial medical management. In particular, for women with HMB associated with adenomyosis, endometrial ablation may be less effective than in other conditions. </p><p>For most women with HMB, we suggest estrogen-progestin contraceptives or the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> as first-line therapy rather than other medications. Both estrogen-progestin contraceptives and the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> are effective treatments for HMB (see <a href=\"#H3002286\" class=\"local\">'Estrogen-progestin contraceptives'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1539650968\" class=\"local\">'Levonorgestrel intrauterine device'</a> below). Both provide effective contraception. Both are well tolerated and have a low risk of adverse effects. The choice between the two depends upon several factors. Estrogen-progestin contraceptives are not an option in patients with a contraindication to estrogen, (eg, hypertension or an increased risk of thrombosis) (see <a href=\"#H3267367834\" class=\"local\">'Elevated venous or arterial thrombosis risk'</a> below). For other patients, the choice depends upon patient preference. Women may prefer estrogen-progestin contraceptives if they prefer taking a daily oral medication, while others prefer the low maintenance of having an indwelling device. In addition, some women prefer the regular bleeding associated with estrogen-progestin contraceptives, while others are willing to tolerate the initial irregular bleeding that accompanies the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> and prefer the eventual light bleeding or amenorrhea. For women who are planning to conceive in the near future, estrogen-progestin contraceptives provide a short-term option. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;</a>.) &#160; </p><p>High-dose oral or injectable progestin-only medications are also reasonable treatment options. Neither progestin-only contraceptive pills nor the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etonogestrel-implant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etonogestrel implant</a> are known to be effective in treating HMB. As noted above, continuous progestin-only medications result in irregular menses that some patient find bothersome, and then eventually, in light bleeding or amenorrhea. </p><p>While some hormonal treatments are also approved for use as contraceptives, others are not. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a> do not provide contraception. Tranexamic acid or NSAIDs are useful for patients with HMB who have contraindications to or would prefer to avoid hormonal agents. </p><p>For selected patients with contraindications to contraceptive dose estrogens, ultra low-dose postmenopausal hormone therapy formulations may be an option. (See <a href=\"#H3002487\" class=\"local\">'Noncontraceptive estrogen-progestin formulations'</a> below.)</p><p>Expectant management is reasonable for women who are not anemic and do not desire treatment. For women with HMB who choose expectant management, depending on the volume of bleeding, we check a hematocrit every 6 to 12 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3267366062\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovulatory dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast with hormonal management of HMB, which has been addressed in a number of randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], few studies have addressed the efficacy of hormonal management in treating ovulatory dysfunction (AUB-O), and no randomized trials have compared progestogen-only therapy with estrogen-progestin formulations or with placebo in the management of irregular bleeding associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">oligo/anovulation</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In some cases, such as submucosal (intracavitary) uterine fibroids, ovulatory women may experience prolonged, irregular bleeding. Although the etiologies of prolonged AUB-O and HMB differ, many treatment strategies effective in treating HMB are also effective choices for women with AUB-O.</p><p>For women with AUB-O, estrogen-progestin contraceptives, oral progestin therapy, or the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> are first-line treatment options, as these approaches reduce bleeding and decrease the risk of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. </p><p>Estrogen-progestin contraceptives have the advantages of providing contraception and regulating bleeding. Cyclic oral progestin therapy (eg, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a>, 10 mg tablets, daily for 10 to 14 days each month) may be effective in some women with AUB-O, resulting in moderate, predictable withdrawal bleeding. Although use of the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> does not cause regular withdrawal bleeding, use in patients with AUB is often appropriate, as most women will eventually become amenorrheic or have only scant bleeding. In contrast to oral medroxyprogesterone acetate, use of the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> also provides effective contraception. </p><p>In women with AUB-O who do not desire future pregnancy and are considering surgical management, endometrial ablation represents a problematic choice for several reasons. Women with anovulation are at elevated risk for endometrial neoplasia, but intrauterine scarring caused by ablation may prevent the cardinal symptom of endometrial neoplasia: bleeding. In addition, conventional approaches to evaluating AUB and diagnosing endometrial neoplasia, including biopsy and sonohysterogram, may not be feasible following ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of endometrial ablation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3002245\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment options</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The comparative efficacy of different therapies for HMB has been evaluated. The <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> represents the most effective medical approach (comparable to the efficacy of endometrial ablation), resulting in 71 to 95 percent reduction in menstrual blood loss. Cyclical oral progestin treatment has been found to reduce bleeding by 87 percent, while estrogen-progestin contraceptive use results in 35 to 69 percent reduction. In systematic reviews that included observational studies and randomized trials of women with heavy menstrual bleeding, use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a> and NSAIDs reduce menstrual blood loss by 26 to 54 percent and 10 to 52 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/20,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3002251\"><span class=\"h3\">Hormonal treatment</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3002286\"><span class=\"h4\">Estrogen-progestin contraceptives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estrogen-progestin contraceptives (OCs) are first-line management for many women with AUB. The advantages of estrogen-progestin contraceptives are that they typically make bleeding more regular, lighter, and reduce dysmenorrhea, as well as provide contraception, if needed. In a clinical trial of women with irregular bleeding, an OC regulated bleeding patterns in significantly more women than placebo (47 versus 9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. &#160;</p><p>OCs have been extensively studied in women with HMB, with randomized trials finding reductions in menstrual blood loss ranging from 35 to 69 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Other routes of administration include the transdermal contraceptive patch (Xulane) and vaginal contraceptive ring (Nuvaring). These have not been studied extensively for HMB, but it is likely that the efficacy of these in treating AUB is similar, and the choice of delivery system depends upon patient preference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to different routes of administration of OCs, there are many different formulations of OCs that vary by the type, dose, and schedule of estrogen and progestin. It appears that most formulations are effective for treating HMB and for regulating bleeding and providing endometrial protection in AUB-O.</p><p>OCs with shorter hormone-free intervals are associated with less withdrawal bleeding than formulations with seven hormone-free days per 28-day pill pack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Although further study is needed to determine which OC formulations are more effective in treating HMB, our preference is to use formulations with four or fewer hormone-free days per pill pack.</p><p>The only OC approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of HMB has a short hormone-free interval. However, there is no evidence that this pill is more effective than other OCs for treating HMB, and other short hormone-free interval pills are available (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;, section on 'Shorter pill-free interval'</a>). The FDA-approved OC (Natazia) includes estradiol valerate (dose varies from 2 to 3 mg); this dose is equivalent to 1.5 to 2.25 mg of micronized oral estradiol, which is equivalent to &lt;20 mcg of ethinyl estradiol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The progestin component is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dienogest-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dienogest</a> (dose varies from 2 to 3 mg). The estradiol <span class=\"nowrap\">valerate/dienogest</span> OC formulation has 26 hormonally active tablets per each 28-day pill pack. The estradiol <span class=\"nowrap\">valerate/dienogest</span> OC was evaluated in a randomized trial of women with AUB (more than three-quarters of the study population had documented HMB; the remainder had prolonged or frequent bleeding) that found significantly reduced menstrual blood loss compared with placebo (reduced by 64 versus 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Because this OC has not been directly compared with other OC formulations, it is uncertain if this formulation&rsquo;s efficacy is greater than that of other OCs in reducing menstrual blood loss in women with HMB (average reduction with OCs is 35 to 69 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>OCs may be prescribed in a cyclic (with a monthly withdrawal bleed), extended (for instance, with a withdrawal bleeding every three months), or continuous (no withdrawal bleed) regimen. Although extended or continuous OC use may more effectively suppress menstrual blood loss in many women, unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding is more common with this approach than with 28-day OC formulations, limiting this strategy&rsquo;s appeal for some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In clinical trials performed in women with normal menses, extended-cycle OC formulations that replace hormonally inactive tablets with low-dose ethinyl estradiol, a formulation which also modifies the ethinyl estradiol dose during each three-month pill pack, appear to reduce unscheduled bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In studies of women with HMB, three months after IUD placement, the most common bleeding pattern is spotting. At six months, menstrual suppression is substantially greater, with the majority of patients experiencing amenorrhea or infrequent bleeding, and median hemoglobin and ferritin levels increase 7.5 and 68.8 percent from baseline, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Serum progestin concentrations produced by <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> do not inhibit ovulation in most women. The high local progestin concentration results in a thinning of the endometrium. A small study of obese women with HMB found that the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> was effective in 67 percent of participants, with significant improvements in quality of life indices at 6 and 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>In women with HMB, the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> has also been found to improve quality of life more than other hormonal or nonhormonal medical treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>Several considerations apply to use of the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> in treating HMB, including the expulsion rate in women with uterine fibroids and the frequency of replacing the device,</p><p>In general, for contraceptive use, the three-year cumulative expulsion rate is 10 per 100 users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Although findings from published studies of women with HMB are not consistent regarding this outcome, expulsion rates also appear to be higher when the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> is placed in women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids compared with other women with HMB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The endometrial cavity is often distorted by the fibroid tumors. Package labeling for the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> lists congenital or acquired distortion of the endometrial cavity (eg, by fibroids) as a contraindication to placement of this IUD. Nonetheless, in women with HMB who wish to avoid surgery or in whom the risk of surgical complications is elevated, use of the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> may be appropriate in well-counseled patients. We counsel women with HMB considering placement of the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> that expulsion rates are elevated compared with use of this device specifically for contraception. </p><p>For women with adenomyosis, one study reported a 25 percent expulsion rate when the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span>.

In some patients in whom AUB has responded well to higher doses of norethindrone acetate (eg one to three 5 mg tablets daily), we slowly taper the dose down to, if possible, as low as 2.5 mg (one-half of a 5 mg tablet) daily. </p><p>In promoting endometrial suppression, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> acetate is substantially more potent than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a>; there are no data regarding use of megestrol, another potent progestin, for HMB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In addition, the majority of the data about use of high-dose oral progestins for HMB have evaluated norethindrone acetate. Accordingly, if cost or side-effect considerations in a specific patient preclude use of norethindrone acetate, we sometimes find it useful to prescribe 20 to 30 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily when treating AUB, particularly in obese patients. </p><p>The progestin-only pill (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> 0.35 mg) is a low-dose formulation that has not been studied in the treatment of AUB (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progestin-only-pills-pops-for-contraception\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Progestin-only pills (POPs) for contraception&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In terms of regimen, there are no high-quality data comparing cyclic and continuous progestin therapy for AUB. When treating women with HMB, in our experience, we find that continuous rather than cyclical progestin therapy is more effective and easier for patients to comply with.

Oral or injectable progestin-only medications are also reasonable as first-line management. The 52 mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device with an initial release rate of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> used for five years <span class=\"nowrap\">(LNg52/5;</span> Mirena) <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5is</span> the most effective medical treatment of HMB. However, due to <span class=\"nowrap\">logistical/financial</span> issues, it is often appropriate to begin therapy with estrogen-progestin regimens or <span class=\"nowrap\">oral/injectable</span> progestin therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3089136802\" class=\"local\">'Heavy menstrual bleeding'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tranexamic acid</a> or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are useful for patients with HMB who have contraindications to or would prefer to avoid hormonal agents. Expectant management is reasonable for women who are not anemic and do not desire treatment. (See <a href=\"#H3089136802\" class=\"local\">'Heavy menstrual bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with AUB-O, estrogen-progestin formulations, oral progestin therapy, or the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> are first-line treatment options, as these approaches reduce bleeding and decrease the risk of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. (See <a href=\"#H3267366062\" class=\"local\">'Ovulatory dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> rather than endometrial ablation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Endometrial ablation is a reasonable choice in women who do not desire future pregnancy and wish to avoid using or changing an intrauterine device. Hysterectomy is a reasonable option in women who do not desire future pregnancy, who desire definitive therapy, and who are aware of the risk of perioperative complications. (See <a href=\"#H3001292\" class=\"local\">'Hysterectomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1539650968\" class=\"local\">'Levonorgestrel intrauterine device'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estrogen-progestins contraceptives are contraindicated in women with risk factors for venous or arterial thrombosis (eg, history of venous thromboembolism, known thrombogenic mutations, &ge;35 years-old and smoking &ge;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">cigarettes/day)</span>. Progestins may be appropriate for some women with such risk factors, but medical consultation may be required. For women at an increased risk of venous or arterial thrombosis treated for AUB with progestins, we suggest the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> rather than depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> (DMPA) or high-dose oral progestins (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
