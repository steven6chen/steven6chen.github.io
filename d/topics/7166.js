The specific entity of &quot;fever of unknown origin&quot; (FUO), as opposed to a &quot;fever without a source&quot; (FWS), has occupied a special place within infectious diseases since the first definition of and series about FUO by Petersdorf and Beeson in 1961 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-etiology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although the original definition has been modified, the assessment of broad categories of illness (including infections, connective tissue disease, and malignancy) as a cause of FUO remains useful.</p><p>Common etiologies of FUO in children will be discussed below. The approach to the child with FUO, FWS, and fever in unique host groups (eg, newborns, neutropenic children, or those with human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection) are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever of unknown origin in children: Evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever without a source in children 3 to 36 months of age&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We apply the term fever of unknown origin (FUO) to children with fever &gt;38.3&ordm;C (101&ordm;F) of at least eight days' duration, in whom no diagnosis is apparent after initial outpatient or hospital evaluation that includes a careful history and physical examination and initial laboratory assessment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-evaluation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever of unknown origin in children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The number of infectious and noninfectious etiologies of fever of unknown origin (FUO) in children is extensive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69379\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69379 \">table 1</a>). FUO is usually caused by common disorders, often with an unusual presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-etiology/abstract/3-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-13</a>].</p><p>The three most common etiologic categories of FUO in children in order of frequency are infectious diseases, connective tissue diseases, and neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-etiology/abstract/3-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-15</a>]. In addition, there are causes of FUO, such as drug fever, factitious fever, central nervous system dysfunction, and others, that do not fit into the above categories. In many cases, a definitive diagnosis is never established and fever resolves.</p><p>In each category below, the conditions are discussed in alphabetical order, rather than by the frequency of diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERALIZED INFECTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generalized infections that cause fever of unknown origin (FUO) typically have nonspecific presenting features. Obtaining a detailed history of exposures can be critical to making the diagnosis of these infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-evaluation#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever of unknown origin in children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Exposures'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Brucellosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brucellosis frequently is considered in the differential diagnosis of FUO because the infection is indolent, causes nonspecific symptoms and signs, and persists if untreated. It is also often excluded as a diagnostic possibility, particularly among clinicians who practice in urban areas and may forget to consider the disease. Clinical manifestations may include persistent fever and lethargy, osteoarticular complaints and epididymo-orchitis, hepatosplenomegaly, mild elevation of liver enzymes, and lymphocytopenia.</p><p>When considering the possibility of brucellosis, it is important to ask about exposure to animals or animal products, especially consumption of unpasteurized cheese <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> imported cheese (pasteurization is not required for certification of imported cheeses). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-brucella\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of Brucella&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of brucellosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cat scratch disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cat scratch disease (CSD, <em>Bartonella henselae</em> infection) is one of the most common causes of FUO in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-etiology/abstract/10,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16</a>]. While CSD frequently presents with isolated lymph node involvement, hepatosplenic involvement is the hallmark of CSD associated with FUO. In one series from a single institution, <em>B. henselae</em> infection accounted for 5 percent of all pediatric cases of FUO and 11 percent of the FUO cases ultimately determined to be caused by infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-etiology/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. High-resolution abdominal ultrasonography revealing the multiple hepatic or splenic filling defects that are characteristic of granulomata can provide a provisional diagnosis. Serology or biopsy of lesions in lymph nodes, liver, or bone marrow can lead to a definitive diagnosis of <em>B. henselae</em> infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of cat scratch disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Leptospirosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leptospirosis is a common zoonotic infection with worldwide distribution; humans are incidental hosts, and most infection occurs in tropical climates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-etiology/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The clinical manifestations are nonspecific and may include fever, rigors, myalgias, headache, cough, and gastrointestinal (GI) complaints. Leptospirosis typically occurs after exposure to environmental sources, such as animal urine, contaminated soil or water (particularly during swimming), or infected animal tissue. Portals of entry include cuts or abraded skin, mucous membranes, or conjunctiva. The infection is rarely acquired by ingestion of food contaminated with urine or via aerosols. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leptospirosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of leptospirosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-leptospirosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of leptospirosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Malaria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malaria is an important consideration in a child with FUO. Splenomegaly usually accompanies fever. Although the patient frequently has a history of travel to areas where malaria is endemic, this is not universal; rare cases have been reported in individuals who have not traveled outside of the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-etiology/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Malaria infection can be delayed for months after travel and can arise in those who have taken malaria prophylaxis. The diagnosis is made by examining appropriately stained thin or thick smears of blood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malaria: Epidemiology, prevention, and control&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of malaria in nonpregnant adults and children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-malaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of malaria&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Mycobacterial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tuberculosis (TB) is another important cause of FUO in children. Extrapulmonary TB (disseminated TB, or TB of the liver, peritoneum, pericardium, or genitourinary tract), is more likely to cause FUO than pulmonary TB, which is usually evident on chest radiography. Active disseminated TB can occur in children with negative chest radiography and tuberculin skin tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-etiology/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. A high index of suspicion for the disease must be maintained and a careful history of possible contacts obtained. The diagnosis of TB can be made by culturing the organism from sputum, gastric aspirates, liver, or bone marrow. Funduscopic examination occasionally can reveal choroid tubercles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Latent tuberculosis infection in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculosis-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculosis disease in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of miliary tuberculosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nontuberculous mycobacterial infection also can cause disseminated infection and FUO, although this is more common in children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections in HIV-negative patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria-excluding-mac-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nontuberculous mycobacteria (excluding MAC) in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Salmonellosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Salmonella</em> species contaminate a number of food products, especially poultry and eggs, and can be transmitted through contact with reptiles or animal feces. <em>Salmonella</em> species can cause typhoidal as well as localized GI illness. Patients with typhoid frequently have normal pulses or even bradycardia in association with high fevers. The diagnosis can be made with blood and stool cultures, which should be repeated if initially negative and fevers persist. Serologic testing is not recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of enteric (typhoid and paratyphoid) fever&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nontyphoidal-salmonella-microbiology-and-epidemiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nontyphoidal Salmonella: Microbiology and epidemiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxoplasmosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toxoplasmosis is another infection that can cause FUO in children. It should be considered in children with exposure to soil contaminated with feline feces or consumption of game meat. Fevers are most often accompanied by cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, but fever may occasionally be the sole manifestation. A rise in antibody titer can establish the diagnosis; however, a single high antibody titer is not sufficient to make a diagnosis of acute infection since immunoglobulin G antibodies to <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> are prevalent, and immunoglobulin M antibodies can persist for months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasmosis in immunocompetent hosts&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Tularemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FUO resulting from tularemia is more common with the pneumonic or typhoidal forms of the infection than with the glandular forms. <em>Francisella tularensis</em> can be carried by a variety of animals and insects (ticks, mosquitoes, lice, fleas, flies) and can be acquired by a bite, ingestion, or inhalation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71081\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71081 \">table 2</a>). Tularemia should be considered in children with a history of contact with animals, exposure to dead wild carcasses (eg, rabbits) or ingestion of rabbit or squirrel meat. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of tularemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most viruses cause self-limited infections of brief duration. However, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, adenovirus, hepatitis viruses, enteroviruses, and certain arboviruses can cause FUO. Symptoms and signs of these infections can be nonspecific and variable. Liver enzymes may be elevated. Viral cultures, serologic studies, and molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction can be used to facilitate the diagnosis. Additional clinical features and diagnosis of these viruses are discussed separately: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytomegalovirus (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cytomegalovirus infections in children&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epstein-Barr virus (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of Epstein-Barr virus infection&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adenovirus (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of adenovirus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of adenovirus infection&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis viruses (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hepatitis-a-virus-infection-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hepatitis A virus infection in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hepatitis B virus infection in children and adolescents&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enteroviruses (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-clinical-features-laboratory-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enterovirus and parechovirus infections: Clinical features, laboratory diagnosis, treatment, and prevention&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arboviruses (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=st-louis-encephalitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;St. Louis encephalitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of West Nile virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthropod-borne-encephalitides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arthropod-borne encephalitides&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">LOCALIZED INFECTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When common localized infections cause fever of unknown origin (FUO), they may have an unusual presentation. Careful and repeated history and physical examination and careful review and interpretation of laboratory tests can help to diagnose these infections. All findings, even those that may seem trivial, must be taken seriously. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-evaluation#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever of unknown origin in children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Overview of evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone and joint</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections involving the bones and joints usually present with recognizable symptoms. However, occasionally FUO can be the only manifestation, especially in young children who cannot vocalize their symptoms. This occurs more commonly with osteomyelitis than with septic arthritis. When FUO is the presenting complaint, the pelvic bones, small bones, and flat bones are more frequently involved than long bones.</p><p>The diagnosis of osteomyelitis or septic arthritis can be suggested by imaging studies, including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and radioisotopic bone scanning. All of these modalities are more sensitive than plain bone radiography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-arthritis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-infants-and-children#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial arthritis: Clinical features and diagnosis in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H601786215\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in children: Evaluation and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Advanced imaging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Infective endocarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infrequent but important cause of FUO in children. IE is rare in normal, term infants but increases in frequency as children age and usually occurs in the setting of a pre-existing cardiac lesion. Acute bacterial endocarditis generally is fulminant in onset, whereas subacute infection is more indolent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infective-endocarditis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infective endocarditis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of IE can be difficult to establish since patients do not always have positive blood cultures or a cardiac murmur, especially if the infection is confined to the right side of the heart. Associated nonspecific laboratory findings can include anemia, leukocytosis, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.</p><p>Viridans streptococci, enterococci, and staphylococci (including <em>S. aureus</em> and coagulase-negative staphylococci) are the organisms most commonly isolated. Blood cultures may be negative if patients have received a trial of empirical antibiotics, have right-sided cardiac involvement, or have infection caused by unusual or fastidious organisms (eg, <em>Brucella</em>, <em>Coxiella burnetii</em>, <em>Bartonella</em> spp, anaerobes, fungi).</p><p>Children with suspected IE as the cause of FUO should have several blood cultures (aerobic and anaerobic) drawn over a 24-hour period before initiation of antimicrobial therapy. Echocardiography is frequently performed to assess damage to the heart valves and look for valvular vegetations. However, the absence of these findings does not exclude the diagnosis of IE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraabdominal abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraabdominal abscesses, including liver, subphrenic, perinephric, and pelvic abscesses, can cause FUO. Patients may not have abdominal complaints at presentation. However, the index of suspicion for an abscess should increase if the patient has a history of prior intra-abdominal disease, abdominal surgery, or vague abdominal pain.</p><p>Pyogenic liver abscesses typically occur in immunocompromised children but can arise in an immunocompetent child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-etiology/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Many children with liver abscess have hepatomegaly and right upper quadrant tenderness, but some only have fever. Liver enzymes are usually normal in these patients, and detectable bacteremia is uncommon.</p><p>Depending upon the source of the abscess, common pathogens include <em>S. aureus</em>, streptococci, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, and anaerobes. Imaging of the abdomen, typically with ultrasonography or CT, generally demonstrates the collection. If imaging is negative, but clinical suspicion of intra-abdominal abscess is high, radioisotope or gallium scanning may be warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatic infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Granulomatous hepatitis, which can be caused by a number of organisms, is another cause of FUO in children. It occurs more commonly in adults, but cases have been reported in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-etiology/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], especially in association with <em>Bartonella</em>. The diagnosis of granulomatous hepatitis can be suggested by ultrasonography or other diagnostic imaging. However, confirmation requires a biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-granulomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic granulomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bacterial cholangitis can occasionally cause FUO in the absence of jaundice and other liver function abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-etiology/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cholangitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cholangitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Upper respiratory tract infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is surprising how frequently upper respiratory tract infections (URI) and infections of related organs, such as mastoids or sinuses, present as FUO in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-etiology/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Mastoiditis, sinusitis, chronic or recurrent otitis media, chronic or recurrent pharyngitis, tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, and nonspecific URI have been reported as causes of FUO in children. One would expect these infections to be associated with localized symptoms, but it appears that complaints may be ignored as trivial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinary tract infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary tract infection is among the most common causes of FUO in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-etiology/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. In one series, the two most frequent laboratory errors were failure to perform a urinalysis and failure to adequately pursue the finding of pyuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-etiology/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Since polyuria and polydipsia can be difficult to appreciate during infancy, dehydration or hypernatremia may be unrecognized until hyperthermia, weight loss, and decreased peripheral perfusion ensue. The diagnosis of DI can be established by evaluating electrolytes and osmolality simultaneously in serum and urine for periods of normal hydration and careful water restriction. Serum levels of antidiuretic hormone can also be determined by radioimmunoassay. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of polyuria and diabetes insipidus&quot;, section on 'Infants and children'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fever is a common allergic reaction to drugs, and virtually any drug can cause a drug fever. When taking a medication history, it is important to include prescription, over-the-counter, and illicit drugs, as well as complementary and alternative therapies. Topical preparations, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">atropine</a>, can also cause fever. The duration of use does not help in determining whether the agent is responsible for the FUO.</p><p>In addition, some drugs impair thermoregulation or thermoregulatory control mechanisms and cause fever on this basis rather than as an allergic phenomenon. Examples include phenothiazines, anticholinergic drugs, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a> and related compounds.</p><p>Neither the height of the fevers nor their pattern is helpful in judging whether drugs are the cause. Drugs can cause low-grade or high and spiking fevers; the pattern can be continuous or intermittent. Fevers resulting from medications typically disappear within 48 to 72 hours of discontinuation of the drug but can take as long as five to seven days to resolve and, occasionally, fever can persist for weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Factitious fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factitious fever, whether a false report by a parent or patient or related to manipulation of body temperature by rinsing the mouth with or dipping the thermometer bulb into hot liquid, can be difficult to establish as the etiology of FUO. However, a number of clues should raise the possibility of factitious fever. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of tachycardia and nonspecific symptoms, such as malaise or discomfort, in a patient with a high fever</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid defervescence without diaphoresis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure of the temperature curve to show normal diurnal variation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever in infants and children: Pathophysiology and management&quot;, section on 'Normal body temperature'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extreme hyperpyrexia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discrepancies between temperatures recorded by the patient or by providers not in attendance and those obtained rectally or when someone is observing in the room</p><p/><p>Measuring the temperature of a freshly voided urine specimen, which reflects core body temperature, is one way to verify or exclude the presence of fever. The temperature of freshly voided urine closely parallels the temperature obtained orally. Electronic or one-time use thermometers that measure temperature rapidly reduce the likelihood that a recorded fever is factitious since a provider is usually in attendance to make these measurements.</p><p>A more unusual cause of factitious fever is Munchausen syndrome or Munchausen syndrome by proxy (caregiver-fabricated illness) in which one person, usually a parent, fabricates symptoms and signs of illness on behalf of the child. In some of these cases, fevers are actually induced by the injection of infective or foreign materials, either by the usually older patient or by a parent.
