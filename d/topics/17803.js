(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and causes of heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The incidence of HF in hypertensive patients varies according to the population and duration of follow-up. As an example, approximately 2 percent of high-risk hypertensive patients in the Avoiding Cardiovascular Events in Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension (ACCOMPLISH) trial developed HF at three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Among the high-risk hypertensive population enrolled into the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack&nbsp;Trial&nbsp;(ALLHAT), 1716 out of 32,804 participants developed HF during an average follow-up of nine years (5.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In contrast to the pattern seen in the general population, in which prognosis is poorer for hypertensive compared with normotensive individuals, a higher blood pressure prior to treatment is a predictor of better survival in patients with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is likely that this correlation is a consequence of the fact that more severe cardiac dysfunction causes a decline in systemic blood pressure, making low blood pressure a marker for more advanced HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This observation makes it difficult to study the benefits of antihypertensive therapy in this population.</p><p>Treatment of hypertension in patients with HF must take into account the type of HF that is present: systolic dysfunction, in which impaired cardiac contractility is the primary abnormality; or diastolic dysfunction, in which there is a limitation to diastolic filling and therefore in forward output due to increased ventricular stiffness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The distinction between these two, not mutually exclusive types of HF can be made by assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction using echocardiography.

Neurohormonal blockade, such as with beta blockers or antagonists of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, also improves cardiac contractility and may lower blood pressure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73782418\"><span class=\"h2\">Antihypertensive regimen in HFrEF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, patients with hypertension and HFrEF should be treated, if possible, with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (or, alternatively, an angiotensin receptor antagonist or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor), a beta blocker, and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. In addition to the mortality benefit associated with this regimen in patients with HFrEF, many patients will experience a minor to moderate improvement in their ejection fraction, with occasional patients experiencing substantial improvement. To maximize clinical improvement, it is important, whenever possible, to try to attain the target doses of these medications that were used in the clinical trials. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Diuretics are used to treat symptomatic hypervolemia (pulmonary <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peripheral edema) or to further reduce blood pressure, if needed, in hypervolemic patients.

To the contrary, there is a rise (usually modest) in the plasma creatinine concentration in approximately 30 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This complication is most likely to occur in patients in whom maintenance of the glomerular filtration rate is dependent upon angiotensin II, such as those on high-dose diuretic therapy. These patients are also at greater risk of first-dose hypotension. The ACE inhibitor does not generally need to be discontinued unless there is a large increase in plasma creatinine or the plasma creatinine continues to rise.

The vasoconstriction induced by angiotensin II in HF is partially ameliorated by the release of vasodilator prostaglandins; blocking this response may minimize the degree to which the vascular resistance falls after the administration of an ACE inhibitor.
