Symptoms can be mild or severe. Even though it is called &quot;morning&quot; sickness, symptoms can happen any time of day. In fact, most women who have the condition feel sick all day long. Morning sickness usually gets better after the first few months of pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H214835677\"><span class=\"h1\">Do all pregnant women get morning sickness?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. But it's very common. As many as 9 out of 10 pregnant women feel nauseous early in pregnancy. A smaller number actually throw up.</p><p>A very small number of pregnant women get very severe nausea and vomiting and lose weight. This is called &quot;hyperemesis gravidarum.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperemesis-gravidarum-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Hyperemesis gravidarum (The Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H214835684\"><span class=\"h1\">When does morning sickness happen?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on the woman and the pregnancy. Symptoms usually start during the first 2 months of pregnancy. They are often worst around the second and third months. Most women feel better by 4 or 5 months, or around the middle of pregnancy. But some women feel bad for much longer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H214835691\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes morning sickness?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors aren't sure why pregnancy sometimes causes nausea and vomiting, or why some women have more nausea and vomiting than others.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H214835698\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Throw up every day or throw up over and over during the day. This is even more of a concern if there is blood in your vomit.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are losing weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have pain or cramps in your belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Think you have lost too many fluids. This is called &quot;dehydration.&quot; Signs include not urinating very much, having dark yellow urine, or feeling dizzy when you stand up.</p><p/><p>If you can't keep anything down, you might need to be given fluids through a thin tube that goes into a vein, called an &quot;IV.&quot; Plus, you might need to get a medicine to prevent nausea and vomiting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H214835705\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your symptoms aren't too serious, here are some things you can try:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat as soon as you feel hungry, or even before you feel hungry</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Snack often and eat small meals &ndash; The best foods to eat have lots of protein or carbohydrates, but not a lot of fat. Good choices are crackers, bread, and low-fat yogurt. You should also avoid spicy foods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink cold, clear beverages that are either fizzy or sour &ndash; Good choices are lemonade and ginger ale.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat ginger-flavored lollipops</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smell fresh lemon, mint, or orange</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brush your teeth right after you eat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not lie down right after you eat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take your vitamins at bedtime with a snack, not in the morning</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid things that make you feel nauseous &ndash; That might include stuffy rooms, strong smells, hot places, loud noises, or not sleeping enough. Try to figure out if some foods and drinks stay down better than others. Avoid foods and drinks that seem to make you feel sick. This is different for different people.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H214835712\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there medicines I can take?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are medicines that can help with nausea and vomiting. Some are safe to take while pregnant. Talk with your doctor before taking anything.</p><p>Medicines that might help include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxylamine-and-pyridoxine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Doxylamine-pyridoxine</a> (brand names: Diclegis, Bonjesta) &ndash; This is a prescription medicine that combines 2 ingredients, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxylamine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">doxylamine</a> and pyridoxine (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b6-pyridoxine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin B6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In some cases, doctors might suggest taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b6-pyridoxine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin B6</a> alone, or with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxylamine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">doxylamine</a>. Doxylamine is sold over-the-counter under different brand names.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Diphenhydramine</a> (sample brand name: Benadryl) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meclizine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">meclizine</a> (sample brand name: Dramamine) &ndash; These medicines are similar to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxylamine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">doxylamine</a>, and are sold over-the-counter under different brand names. Your doctor might suggest trying them. They can make you sleepy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medicines &ndash; There are other medicines that can sometimes be used if the above don't work. Your doctor can help you figure out what treatments are best for you.</p><p/><p>There are also bands that you can wear on your wrists called &quot;acupressure&quot; bands. These bands are supposed to reduce morning or motion sickness. Some women feel better if they wear them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H214835719\"><span class=\"h1\">Can morning sickness be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors urge all women who might get pregnant or who are pregnant to take multivitamins. The multivitamin should contain 400 micrograms of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a>. Taking multivitamins before pregnancy and in early pregnancy might decrease nausea and vomiting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H214835726\"><span class=\"h1\">Will morning sickness hurt my baby?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. It is OK to gain weight slowly in the beginning of your pregnancy. Most women should gain between 25 and 35 pounds by the end. Even women with the worst symptoms usually have healthy babies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H214835733\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-symptoms-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pregnancy symptoms (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperemesis-gravidarum-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hyperemesis gravidarum (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-before-and-during-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nutrition before and during pregnancy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
