The dose history helps guide treatment decisions, but it is not sufficient evidence on which to base treatment after an acute overdose. Most studies have found no correlation between the amount of acetaminophen reportedly ingested and the serum concentration measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,83,84</a>].</p><p>For an acute overdose, the serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> concentration should be measured as soon as possible as long as at least four hours have passed since the ingestion. There is no utility to serum concentrations measured less than four hours after ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].

While there is universal agreement that NAC is effective for the prevention of hepatic injury when administered soon after acetaminophen overdose, the exact guidelines for the initiation of treatment vary throughout the world. The Rumack-Matthew Treatment nomogram (four hour concentration of 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span> has been used in the United States for more than 30 years and is the author's preferred tool to guide treatment because of its safety and efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>].

Until more experience with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> overdose is obtained, the clinician is encouraged to contact a regional poison control center for assistance with assessment and management of these patients.

Some authorities (including the manufacturer) recommend that both a four- and eight-hour serum acetaminophen concentration be measured and treatment with NAC initiated if either concentration is above the &quot;possible hepatic toxicity&quot; line of the nomogram. It is likely that a single acetaminophen concentration plotted on the nomogram and below the treatment line is adequate to exclude the need for NAC treatment. Until more clinical experience has been gained, our recommendation is to follow the conservative approach of the manufacturer.

However, in some cases, there is no practical way to ascertain the time of ingestion, making it impossible to use the nomogram for risk stratification. In these situations, our approach, for patients in whom a single ingestion has occurred is to narrow the ingestion time to a specific window (eg, the patient had been continually observed until 12 hours prior to admission so the ingestion could not have occurred more than 12 hours ago), it may be possible to construct a worst possible scenario and plot the measured serum concentration using the &quot;last known time prior to ingestion&quot; as the time of ingestion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H151833225\"><span class=\"h3\">Acetaminophen-protein adducts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The oxidation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> by hepatic enzymes forms a reactive metabolite that may bind to hepatic proteins.
