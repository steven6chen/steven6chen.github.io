(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are unique challenges in caring for children and adolescents with diabetes that differentiate pediatric from adult care. These include the obvious differences in the size of the patients, developmental issues such as the unpredictability of a toddler's dietary intake and activity level and inability to communicate symptoms of hypoglycemia, and medical issues such as the increased risk of hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Because of these considerations, the management of a child with type 1 diabetes must take into account the age and developmental maturity of the child.</p><p>Although most children with type 1 diabetes present with the classic signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia without accompanying acidosis, approximately 30 percent of children in the United States present with DKA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The management of these patients is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and complications of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The management of the child or adolescent with type 1 diabetes, who either did not present with ketoacidosis or who has recovered from ketoacidosis, will be reviewed here.

Team members should include an endocrinologist, nurse educator, dietitian, and a mental health professional, who can provide pediatric-specific education and care. Comprehensive management by a pediatric diabetes team reduces the number of hospitalizations and emergency room visits, and is cost-effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Training and care of the patient and family is divided into two management phases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the initial phase, treatment with insulin is initiated, and the patient and family are taught the most essential skills to safely manage diabetes. In the second phase, the family is given further education and support to optimize glycemic control and long-term management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial phase begins at the time of diagnosis. In these first few days, the family begins to understand the disease process and is trained to successfully measure blood glucose concentrations, administer insulin, recognize and treat hypoglycemia, and measure blood or urine ketone concentration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71840\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71840 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basic understanding &ndash; The diabetes team teaches the patient and family the cause and treatment of type 1 diabetes, how to maintain a daily schedule and record of blood glucose test results, insulin administration, and the timing and carbohydrate content of meals and snacks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood glucose testing &ndash; Families must master blood glucose testing. A variety of easy-to-use blood glucose meters are available for this purpose. The parents or caregivers are instructed on the frequency and timing of blood glucose testing, depending upon the needs of their child. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Blood glucose monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insulin administration &ndash; Training includes teaching the family about the different types of prescribed insulin, how to measure and inject insulin, and how to rotate injection sites. Family members and caretakers must learn about the duration and action of the various types of insulin prescribed for their child. They must also understand how to adjust the insulin dose based upon blood glucose concentrations and carbohydrate intake. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Insulin'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In our practice, we encourage the parents to administer the first injection. Although this requires additional assistance and fairly directive behavior on the part of the clinician, we find that it facilitates the learning process. Because most parents are frightened about administering an injection to their child, their ability to learn is limited until they have administered the first injection. We also find it useful to have the parents administer a saline injection to themselves so that they realize the discomfort is minimal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoglycemia &ndash; Families are taught to recognize the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. Detection of hypoglycemia is particularly difficult in the nonverbal young child and infant in whom the signs of hypoglycemia are nonspecific. Parents are trained to check a blood glucose level and, if this is too low, to intervene with dietary measures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glucagon</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoglycemia in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Age-based care'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood or urine ketones &ndash; Families are taught to check urine for ketones or measure blood beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration at times of illness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if two consecutive blood glucose readings are greater than 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (13.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This is especially important in young children, insulin pump users, or those with a history of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Blood glucose monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The initial educational and care phase may occur either in the inpatient or ambulatory setting. Most institutions have moved from prolonged inpatient admissions for newly diagnosed patients to either short hospitalizations or exclusively ambulatory management. Patient outcome is similar with outpatient and inpatient management, regardless of the length of inpatient hospitalization, and health care costs are much less with outpatient treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. Accordingly, we initiate the care of most newly diagnosed children with type 1 diabetes without ketoacidosis in the outpatient setting. A multidisciplinary team provides close follow-up (daily phone contact and ambulatory visits as necessary), comprehensive education, and an individualized management plan for the child and family.</p><p>Once the family and care providers are comfortable with the family's ability to manage the child's diabetes at home, plans should be made to return the child to school or daycare center, as appropriate. If insulin needs to be administered at the child's school or daycare center, a responsible individual must be identified and trained in basic diabetes management skills. In addition, appropriate individuals at the school or daycare center must be provided with information regarding the detection and management of hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=special-situations-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Special situations in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'School and daycare'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with diabetes should wear a medical emergency <span class=\"nowrap\">bracelet/necklace</span> to enable suitable intervention by emergency personnel should an emergency situation arise (ie, hypoglycemia or DKA). MedicAlert provides an excellent resource (<a href=\"http://www.medicalert.org/&amp;token=5yvz7lCf0hefbc5ZhmpaTbTbwuWhpPBvF7yeHgTwlEHp6x6+VwH6cgp116pr7mDa&amp;TOPIC_ID=5817\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.medicalert.org</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Ongoing management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the initial phase, the diabetes team continues to provide care, teaching, and support to the child and family. Sessions with individual team members (endocrinologist, nurse educator, dietitian, and a mental health professional) allow more in-depth education and care directed toward the goal of maintaining excellent glucose control. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Self-management education for the child with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>During these sessions, the concepts that are required for glycemic control are taught and reinforced. These include the interaction of insulin, diet, and exercise on blood glucose concentrations. A management regimen specific for each patient is designed to achieve the best possible glucose control. In addition, the clinician should explain that strict glycemic control helps to prevent long-term sequelae of diabetes; this discussion should be repeated and reinforced as often as necessary, particularly if glycemic control is suboptimal.</p><p>Providing age-appropriate psychosocial support for the patient and the family by a proficient mental health professional improves adherence to the management plan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In two controlled trials, structured psychoeducational support significantly improved glycemic control and reduced hospitalization rates in adolescents whose diabetes had previously been poorly controlled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>As the child grows older, education and training are directed toward increased autonomy and self-management for the patient. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Age-based care'</a> below.)</p><p>Printed literature and Web sites available for patient and family education are excellent supplements to the teaching provided by the diabetes team (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71046\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71046 \">table 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">AGE-BASED CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management plan of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes depends on the child's age, cognitive ability, and emotional maturity, which affect his or her ability to communicate symptoms and participate in self-management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53457\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53457 \">table 3</a>). </p><p>Because newer data point to an adverse effect of prolonged hyperglycemia on neurologic development in younger children, recommended goals for glycemic control no longer vary across the pediatric age groups. However, the goals should be individualized based on the characteristics of the individual patient. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Children and adolescents'</a> below.)</p><p>The following discussion on age-based management is compatible with the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines for the care of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants (younger than one year of age) with diabetes have the highest risk of severe hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Hypoglycemia is difficult to detect because infants are unable to communicate their symptoms and clinical signs are nonspecific (eg, poor feeding, lethargy, jitteriness, hypotonia).</p><p>Infants with severe hypoglycemia can present with seizures or coma, which may have permanent neurologic sequelae. In addition, repeated prolonged episodes of hypoglycemia as well as persistent hyperglycemia may have deleterious effects on brain development and learning, especially in children younger than five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. Clinical experience with modern management methods suggest that more stringent glycated hemoglobin (A1C) targets improve glycemic control without significantly increasing the risk for severe hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]. As a result, targets for glycemic control in infants and young children are now similar to those for older age groups, in which equal value is placed on avoiding both hypo- and hyperglycemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoglycemia in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Glycemic control'</a> below.) </p><p>The frequent feeding schedule of infancy makes it challenging to develop a management plan that avoids episodes of hypoglycemia but provides sufficient glycemic control. In addition, the stress of implementing the daily care plan can have adverse effects on parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Toddlers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The issues surrounding the care of toddlers (one to three years of age) are similar to those in infants. The parents must learn to manage diabetes and be responsible for the daily care of the patient and also learn to recognize episodes of hypoglycemia. Avoiding hypoglycemia can be challenging because of the erratic food intake and activity levels of toddlers. This problem can be addressed by frequent blood glucose monitoring (or the use of continuous glucose monitoring) and use of an insulin pump or other flexible dosing systems. It also can be difficult to distinguish developmentally normal episodes of oppositional behavior and temper tantrums from altered behavior caused by hypoglycemia. The parents must learn to measure blood glucose before ignoring a temper tantrum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Preschool and early school-aged children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For preschool and early school-aged children (three to seven years of age), parents still provide most of the daily diabetes care. However, some of these patients can begin to participate in their own care by testing their blood glucose or preparing materials. Often, such mastery behaviors are short-lived, as the children rapidly become bored and wish to forgo such responsibilities. The parents must be counseled that this behavior is normal and age appropriate. Shared care with the child is appropriate at this age only under direct parental supervision. </p><p>As these children enter daycare or school, childcare providers and school nurses must be involved in their diabetes care. For parents, sharing care with others, including the patient, may be difficult. Continued support by the care team is important to facilitate this transition. In the United States, children younger than six years may be eligible to receive supplemental Social Security income to help their parents with the economic impact of diabetes management in the young child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

The child can learn to administer the routine insulin injections, but still needs significant assistance and supervision for management decisions that are not routine. All glucose testing and insulin administration should be under adult supervision. Early independent self-management in this age group with minimal or no adult supervision results in poorer glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. </p><p>The diagnosis of diabetes has a psychological impact on these children, which may be manifested by depression and anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Children may also have difficulty with social interactions because of their perception that they are different from their peers. The parents and the diabetes team should encourage participation in school activities to develop normal peer relationships and ensure regular school attendance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Interactions at camp can be useful in acquainting children with unfamiliar methods for glucose monitoring and insulin administration and may engage patients with these technologies in a peer-interactive rather than physician-driven environment. </p><p>Screening for behavioral disturbances and discussion of psychosocial issues should be included in the routine medical care for a child with diabetes; at-risk children may subsequently benefit from evaluation of parental mental health and family dynamics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is important for caregivers to recognize developing cognitive deficits and learning difficulties, and for appropriate care to be provided to children if these deficits develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This is particularly important because of the higher risk of cognitive deficits in children who developed diabetes at a very young age, those with poor glycemic control, frequent episodes of hypoglycemia, and longer duration of the disease.

Family-focused care, which included establishing a responsibility-sharing plan at the end of each patient visit and active family discussion, increased family involvement, and resulted in better glycemic control (adjusted A1C, 8.8 versus 9.3 percent).

More or less stringent goals may be appropriate for individual patients, depending on their personal history of severe hyperglycemia and severe hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia unawareness, known micro- and macrovascular complications, and lifestyle or psychosocial considerations. </p><p>In the past, ADA set higher A1C targets for young children because of concerns that more stringent targets might increase the risk for hypoglycemic episodes. However, clinical experience with modern management methods suggest that the target of &lt;7.5 percent does not significantly increase the risk for severe hypoglycemia. Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that hyperglycemia is associated with micro- and macrovascular complications, including in the central nervous system of the prepubertal child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4,45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,45-47</a>].</p><p>Glycemic control can be achieved in many pediatric patients. This was illustrated in a single-center study of 455 pediatric patients (&lt;18 years of age), among whom the mean A1C level was 7.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. More than two-thirds of the children met the center's goal of A1C &lt;8 percent. Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that lower socioeconomic status, older age, longer duration of diabetes, injection therapy (rather than insulin pump therapy), and female gender were associated with poorer glycemic control. However, other studies that included data from more diverse management settings showed worse rates of glycemic control, particularly among adolescents: A1C levels were &gt;7.5 percent in more than 70 percent of adolescents, regardless of insulin regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Similar findings were reported from a large cross-sectional registry study, in which children less than six years old who used an insulin pump had an average A1C of 7.9 percent, and those who did not use a pump had an average A1C of 8.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

Ongoing monitoring allows the child and family to become familiar with the patient's glycemic response to different types and amount of foods, exercise, and stress. Options for blood glucose monitoring include multiple daily fingersticks or one of several types of devices for continuous glucose monitoring. Selection of the method depends upon the patient&rsquo;s needs and preferences, and device availability; considerations for each method are outlined below. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Fingersticks'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Continuous glucose monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Frequent monitoring has been shown to improve glycemic control in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4,52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,52,53</a>] and decrease the frequency of severe hypoglycemic episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Children and their parents show poor ability to detect high or low blood glucose levels based on symptoms alone. In a study that compared self-reporting of hypoglycemia with glucose meter results, children (aged 6 to 11 years) and their parents failed to detect about half of the episodes of clinically significant hypoglycemia (&lt;55 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Therefore, blood glucose monitoring is essential to avoid severe hypoglycemia and to optimize blood glucose control. Generally, the frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is highest in children under the age of six years and decreases with increasing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Predictors of lower frequency of SMBG include lower self-esteem, high stress life events, and inadequate parental support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Psychosocial support and parental supervision may help optimize the frequency of SMBG in older children. </p><p>To prevent the development of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), patients must check for urine or blood ketones when blood glucose is persistently &ge;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (13.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> or during acute episodes of increased stress, including intercurrent illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients who have hyperglycemia and positive urine ketones or increased blood ketone concentrations should be treated with additional insulin (with or without additional carbohydrates) and increased fluid intake, combined with meticulous monitoring of blood glucose and ketone concentrations. With these interventions, most cases of DKA can be avoided or aborted. The education of patients and families should include information regarding the parameters of when it is necessary to call the diabetes care team for assistance.

This is especially true in very young children who are at increased risk for severe hypoglycemia, and in patients who are treated with intensive therapy who have multiple meals and snacks during the day and require blood glucose checks prior to administration of a pre-meal bolus of insulin. To safeguard against hypoglycemia, monitoring at anticipated peaks of insulin action and during periods of increased physical activity may be necessary. (See <a href=\"#H11299132\" class=\"local\">'Value of an intensive regimen'</a> below.)</p><p>Blood glucose is typically monitored using a blood glucose meter, which requires a small sample of blood (0.3 to 1 microliter) obtained by fingerstick. Many new lancet devices are available, some of which are ultrafine gauge, and others of which contain multiple lancets for ease and safety of handling. In general, using a lancet only once will minimize discomfort, but children will sometimes use lancets more than once without much ill effect. Some devices permit blood sampling from the forearm; this technique is less painful than using the side of the finger, but provides a blood sample which is not as close to arterial blood as that from the fingertip and may not identify hypoglycemia as quickly as a fingertip sample.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuous glucose monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subcutaneous glucose sensors that continuously measure interstitial fluid glucose levels are available and approved for use in children.

They must be used in conjunction with conventional capillary blood glucose monitoring (fingerstick), for calibration.

These benefits were not observed in adolescents older than 14 years. There was no difference between groups in the number of episodes of severe hypoglycemia in any age group. This type of CGM also improved patient satisfaction because of increasing awareness of trends of rising or falling glucose levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].

In general, intensive regimens are recommended because they are more likely to meet glycated hemoglobin (A1C) targets and have better clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An intensive regimen provides insulin in a manner that more closely approaches physiologic insulin secretion than does conventional therapy. It includes administration of an insulin preparation that will maintain a basal insulin level and suppress lipolysis and hepatic glucose production, with additional pre-meal and pre-snack boluses of rapid-acting insulin to minimize postprandial elevation of blood glucose. These boluses are adjusted according to the carbohydrate content of meals as well as the current blood glucose level. This approach allows greater flexibility than the conventional regimen in terms of timing and carbohydrate content of meals. Insulin regimens administered by an insulin pump are also considered an intensive regimen. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Insulin pump'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Short-acting insulins are typically no longer included in the routine management of type 1 diabetes in the Unites States, but can be helpful under special circumstances such as gastroparesis and intake of high fat meals, when mixed with rapid-acting insulin. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A conventional regimen was traditionally used for diabetes management, but this approach is uncommon today because it is unlikely to achieve optimal glycemic control. It included administration of an intermediate-acting insulin (NPH) at least twice a day (at breakfast and a second dose either at dinner or bedtime), with a rapid-acting (ie, lispro, aspart, or glulisine) or short-acting (&quot;regular&quot;) insulin two or three times a day. The rapid- or short-acting insulin would be given at breakfast and dinner, and sometimes at lunch or with the afternoon snack depending on blood glucose concentrations. This regimen is fixed and the patient and family must adjust their lifestyles so that meals and vigorous physical activity occur on a relatively fixed daily schedule. Two-thirds of the total daily dose is administered before breakfast <span class=\"nowrap\">(2/3</span> as NPH and <span class=\"nowrap\">1/3</span> as rapid- or short-acting insulin) and one-third before dinner and at bedtime <span class=\"nowrap\">(1/3</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">1/2</span> as rapid- or short-acting insulin before dinner and <span class=\"nowrap\">2/3</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">1/2</span> as NPH at bedtime). The dose of NPH can be split such that a portion is delivered before dinner and the remainder at bedtime.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A modified-intensive regimen is sometimes used in children and offers the benefit of fewer injections during school hours (useful when a school nurse is not available) and flexibility around meals while at home. Such a regimen includes the administration of an intermediate-acting insulin (NPH) with rapid-acting insulin (based on carbohydrate counting) at breakfast, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">insulin glargine</a> or detemir with a dose of rapid-acting insulin (based on carbohydrate counting) at dinner. This regimen avoids the need for a lunch-time dose of rapid-acting insulin. </p><p/><p>In adults, controlled studies such as the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) have demonstrated that intensive insulin therapy achieved better glycemic control and reduced the incidence of long-term sequelae, compared with conventional insulin therapy (which utilized one or two fixed insulin injections, including mixtures of insulin) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61305\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61305 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73143\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73143 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>In adolescents, controlled studies show similar improved glycemic control with intensive therapy, as compared with conventional therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>].

This was illustrated in a controlled cross-over trial of 28 adolescents with type 1 diabetes that compared MDI using insulin glargine and lispro with conventional therapy using NPH and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">regular insulin</a> during two 16-week study periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>], in which MDI compared with conventional therapy resulted in lower mean fasting; pre- and post-breakfast, and pre- and post-lunch blood glucose levels.

It usually has a duration of action 24 to 26 hours, but the half-life is shorter in some patients, requiring division of the daily dose into two injections per day. </p><p>Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has only approved <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">insulin glargine</a> in children six years of age or older, the use of insulin glargine appears to be beneficial in younger children as well. Observational studies in children younger than six years of age have shown that the use of insulin glargine reduced the incidence of severe hypoglycemic episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/78-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-80</a>] and improved glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>]. In a controlled cross-over trial of 28 adolescents with type 1 diabetes, use of insulin glargine and lispro resulted in a reduced incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with use of conventional therapy with NPH and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">regular insulin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. These results are probably due to the increased flexibility of this regimen in young children who have unpredictable patterns of meal intake and variable levels of physical exercise.</p><p>MDI regimens using glargine in children should be carried out under the supervision of an experienced pediatric diabetes team. Studies have explored the possibility of an association between the use of glargine, which has a modified structure similar to insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and risk of malignancy. The results are not conclusive, and most experts feel that this is not a concern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>].</p><p>Although many families choose an MDI regimen because of its increased flexibility compared with a conventional regimen, MDI requires frequent blood glucose monitoring and insulin injections. The patient and family also are required to count dietary carbohydrates and accurately judge the effect of exercise on insulin requirements. Without this active management by a well-trained patient and family, the benefits of this regimen are not attained. Before initiation of MDI, the patient and family must understand and accept the increased commitment and the need for increased frequency of blood monitoring and insulin injections required by this therapeutic approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Insulin pump</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The insulin pump (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion) is increasingly used in the pediatric population. In 2006, there were more than 35,000 patients younger than the age of 21 years who received insulin therapy through a pump system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].

The rate of insulin administration can be transiently increased to give mealtime or glucose correction boluses. Most insulin pump therapy is now started with a rapid-acting insulin, rather than short-acting insulin. <span class=\"nowrap\">Pre-meal/snack</span> boluses are administered to minimize increases in postprandial glucose concentrations. Insulin is delivered through a subcutaneously inserted catheter that is replaced at two- to three-day intervals. Information on insulin administration, frequency of catheter site changes, and frequency and timing of premeal insulin boluses can be downloaded from a memory chip within the pump. </p><p>Insulin pump therapy relies on frequent blood glucose monitoring with appropriate readjustment of insulin infusion rates either by the patient or parent. The pump also can be used in conjunction with a continuous glucose monitoring device; this approach is known as sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy. Fully &quot;closed loop&quot; systems are in development, in which blood glucose values are determined and automatically used to reprogram the insulin pump.

Of note, most families with young children who participated in clinical studies decided to continue with pump therapy even after the study was completed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p>Insulin pump therapy may reduce later risk of diabetes complications compared with MDI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].

Without this increased commitment, the benefits of this regimen are not attained. Before initiation of insulin pump therapy, the patient and family must be informed and accept the increased work required by this therapeutic approach. The beneficial effect of the insulin pump is maintained only if the child and family continue to devote time to carbohydrate counting and determining appropriate insulin boluses at mealtime.</p><p>Other considerations regarding the choice of regimen include the greater cost of the pump and its supplies compared with those of syringes and needles used in MDI therapy, as well as the complications of pump therapy, such as infusion pump failure, superficial infection, and minor dermatologic changes such as nodules or scars at the catheter site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/101,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">101,102</a>]. Because rapid- or short-acting insulin is used alone in insulin pumps and patients have no long-acting subcutaneous depot of insulin, pump failure can result in rapid onset of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This is another reason why frequent blood glucose checking is mandated in children on insulin pump therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. </p><p>Although multiple studies have demonstrated an improvement of diabetes control with the insulin pump compared with MDI, decreased adherence to the pump protocol can occur over time and is associated with deterioration in control.

Some insulin pumps can deliver much smaller doses of insulin, of the order of 0.025 units at a time, often obviating this problem.</p><p>Follow-up visits at least every three months are required to adjust for the increasing insulin requirement with continued growth of the child and increasing insulin deficiency with duration of diabetes. The family can be taught to make interim adjustments via telephone consultation. As a child enters puberty, daily insulin requirements may increase to more than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/kg</span> because puberty increases insulin resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Balance of insulins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To use the different types of insulin in intensive therapy, the various functions of exogenous insulin need to be considered.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basal insulin &ndash; In children, the basal insulin requirement (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">insulin glargine</a> or basal rate of pump) usually is approximately 40 to 50 percent of the total daily dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Correction of elevated blood glucose &ndash; An insulin correction factor can be used to select an insulin dose to correct hyperglycemia before meals or between meals. For rapid-acting insulin, divide 1500 by the total daily insulin dose. This calculation estimates the decrease in blood glucose from one unit of a rapid-acting insulin. As an example, if the total daily insulin dose is 30 units, then 1 unit of rapid-acting insulin will decrease the blood glucose approximately by 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Utilization of ingested carbohydrate &ndash; A rapid-acting insulin pre-meal or pre-snack is used to provide the insulin requirements for the anticipated consumption of carbohydrates. The amount of ingested carbohydrate covered by one unit of rapid-acting insulin is roughly calculated based upon the total daily insulin dose and dividing this into 500. As an example, if the total daily insulin dose is 50 units, then 1 unit of rapid-acting insulin will cover 10 grams of carbohydrate. For short-acting (regular) insulin (rarely used in MDI or pump regimens), divide 450 by the total daily insulin dose. However, there is a wide range of insulin to carbohydrate ratios, with more insulin being required in older children and less in younger children than indicated by these calculations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">On average, 1 unit of insulin is required to cover:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>20 grams of carbohydrates in most young children (1 to 6 years of age)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>10 to 12 grams of carbohydrates in older prepubertal children</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>8 to 10 grams in pubertal adolescents </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H729484988\"><span class=\"h3\">Honeymoon phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A few weeks after the diagnosis and initiation of insulin therapy, a period of decreasing exogenous insulin requirement occurs, commonly referred to as the &quot;honeymoon&quot; or remission phase of diabetes. During this period, the remaining functional beta cells secrete some endogenous insulin resulting in reduced exogenous requirement. Close monitoring of blood glucose is mandatory as hypoglycemic episodes are likely if the insulin dose is not appropriately adjusted. The duration of this phase is variable and may last several months to several years. Rising blood glucose levels, A1C, and increasing exogenous insulin need indicates the end of this phase.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H729484970\"><span class=\"h3\">Converting from MDI to insulin pump therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When converting a patient from MDI or conventional therapy to insulin pump, the initial dose is dependent on diabetes control and total daily insulin dose. If control has been excellent, the initial daily insulin pump dose is 10 to 20 percent less than the previous dose. If control has been poor, the same total previous daily dose should be used. One study suggests patients using detemir insulin may require greater dose reductions (26 to 33 percent) when switching from MDI to the insulin pump [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. More sophisticated approaches to control of postprandial hyperglycemia include administration of bolus insulin as a dual wave and as a square wave, prolonging its action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/91,111\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,111</a>]. For dual wave administration, the mealtime insulin dose is divided into a bolus followed by a continuous infusion over two hours; this is useful for meals with varied glycemic content, and especially high fat. For square wave administration (also known as extended bolus), the dose of insulin is given as a continuous infusion over two hours; this is useful for snacking over an extended period of time, as might occur in social settings.

Among these adjunctive therapies, pramlintide is the most promising based on studies in adults, but requires careful management to avoid severe hypoglycemia.

In a trial in overweight adolescents with type 1 diabetes randomly assigned to metformin or placebo as an adjunct to insulin treatment, use of metformin did not improve glycemic control at six months, and increased adverse gastrointestinal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. However, the group receiving metformin had a lower mean total daily insulin dose and less weight gain during the trial (mean weight gain 0 kg in the metformin group, compared with 2 kg in the control group). Furthermore, 24 percent of participants in the metformin group compared to only 7 percent of those in the placebo group were able to reduce their body mass index (BMI) by at least 10 percent. This study does not support prescribing metformin as adjunctive therapy for overweight adolescents to improve glycemic control, but it suggests that metformin may help some patients to lose weight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transplantation &ndash; Techniques for pancreas or islet cell transplantation for patients with type 1 diabetes continues to evolve. Pancreas transplantation is limited to adults with serious progressive complications of diabetes in whom the quality of life is unacceptable, including those with end-stage renal disease who require a kidney transplant.

Ideally, meal planning should provide a consistent carbohydrate intake. This is especially true for children on a conventional fixed insulin regimen who require a nutritional prescription. Meal planning must be individualized to accommodate the child's food preference and cultural eating patterns and schedules. In young children, mealtime behaviors and eating habits may complicate bolus insulin therapy because of failure to completely finish food and picky eating habits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>].</p><p>Many patients have experienced weight loss when diabetes is first diagnosed. The lost weight is generally regained during the first few weeks of therapy due to insulin, hydration, and adequate energy intake. During this time of increased consumption, children often require large amounts of insulin to control their blood glucose levels. After the weight loss is corrected, ongoing assessment of growth (eg, weight, height, body mass index [BMI]) is necessary to monitor adequacy of dietary intake and glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. </p><p>Excellent glycemic control is necessary for normal growth and development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. Excess insulin administration, or failure to reduce insulin dose post puberty or after initial regain of weight, may lead to excessive weight gain as the child attempts to treat hypoglycemia by overeating. If the child becomes overweight, caloric intake or insulin administration may need to be reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Consultation with a registered dietitian with experience in pediatric nutrition and diabetes is an important component of diabetes care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The dietitian provides instruction regarding the effect of food on blood glucose concentration, a diet that ensures adequate nutritional intake, and information regarding carbohydrate counting. Mastery of carbohydrate counting and understanding the glycemic effects of different kinds of carbohydrates is especially important in patients on an intensive regimen, who need to adjust pre-meal boluses insulin based upon the anticipated glycemic effect of consumed carbohydrates. The glycemic effect also depends on the balance among carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in a given meal. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Balance of insulins'</a> above.)</p><p>Nutrition management including consistency of carbohydrate intake, carbohydrate counting, and glycemic content and index is discussed in greater detail separately.

Exercise also presents several important challenges, which require careful management. In patients with diabetes, the intensity and duration of exercise affects the physiologic response and risk for hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can occur during or immediately after exercise, or be delayed by several hours. The physiologic response to exercise also depends upon the plasma insulin concentration at the time of exercise. Exercise also can trigger hyperglycemia under certain circumstances. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H64441725\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of exercise for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Clinical consequences'</a>.)</p><p>Children who participate in sport activities require increased monitoring of blood glucose (before, after, and at regular intervals during prolonged strenuous activity) and appropriate adjustment of insulin dosing. School personnel and coaches need to recognize symptoms of hypoglycemia and know how to treat hypoglycemia. At the beginning of a new sports season, frequent blood glucose monitoring during the 12 hours after physical activity should be performed to guide insulin dose adjustment as insulin requirements will decrease during this period. Afternoon or evening exercise may cause hypoglycemia later that night. Therefore, it is prudent for patients to check blood glucose during the overnight period after strenuous exercise.

This is especially important for children 10 years and older and for those who are not adhering to the diabetes management regimen. Patients with significant depression or other concerns should be referred for evaluation by a mental health specialist. (See <a href=\"#H14093670\" class=\"local\">'Referrals'</a> below.) </p><p>Diabetes has a psychological impact on the patient and family, as do other chronic diseases.

In older children and adolescents, family conflict arises over the level of adult involvement in the care of the patient during a normal developmental period of increasing independence and self-assertiveness. These psychological issues lead to poorer glycemic control and an increased risk of hospitalization and episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/118-121\" class=\"abstract_t\">118-121</a>].

This requires comprehensive case management and intensive training of the patient and family. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes education and self-management training by a pediatric diabetes multidisciplinary team provides the ideal setting to acquire the knowledge and skills needed for care. Training is divided into an initial and ongoing management phase. In the initial phase, the team teaches the family about the disease process and skills required for daily care (administering insulin, blood glucose monitoring, testing for urine ketones, and recognizing and treating hypoglycemia) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71840\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71840 \">table 1</a>). In the ongoing phase, the care and training required for excellent control are reviewed. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific challenges with diabetes management arise in each age group, and these should be anticipated and addressed with the child and family (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53457\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53457 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Age-based care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As a general goal for glycemic control, we suggest a target A1C of &lt;7.5 percent for children and adolescents. However, glycemic targets should be further tailored to the individual patient; more or less stringent goals may be appropriate for individual patients. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Glycemic control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that an intensive insulin regimen be selected for children with type 1 diabetes, whenever possible (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Intensive compared with conventional therapy improves glycemic control and decreases long-term complications of diabetes. (See <a href=\"#H11299132\" class=\"local\">'Value of an intensive regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intensive insulin therapy combines the administration of a basal level of insulin together with premeal boluses of a rapid-acting insulin. The approximate time of onset, peak activity, and duration of action of the most commonly used insulins are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61880\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61880 \">table 4</a>). This regimen can be delivered by two methods: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Multiple daily injections (MDI) &ndash; This technique consists of injections of a long-acting insulin analog once or twice daily, and rapid- or short-acting insulin before each meal and snack. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Insulin pump &ndash; This is a device that delivers a continuous subcutaneous infusion of a rapid- or short-acting insulin, which is supplemented by boluses before each meal or snack. This method of insulin delivery is generally preferred because of enhanced diabetes control compared with MDI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Both types of intensive regimens require extensive training, commitment, and work for the patient and family. The choice depends upon the needs and preferences of the patient and family, cost considerations, and clinician preferences. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Multiple daily injections'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Insulin pump'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood glucose monitoring is required for optimal glycemic control. The frequency of monitoring is dependent upon the risk of hypoglycemic episodes, the insulin regimen selected, and level of physical activity. Options for blood glucose monitoring include fingersticks (at least four times daily), or one of several types of devices for continuous glucose monitoring. Selection of the method depends upon the patient&rsquo;s needs and preferences, and device availability. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Blood glucose monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The impact of nutrition and exercise on insulin requirements and glycemic control should be reviewed with the patient and family. Detailed plans to ensure good glycemic control, with healthy nutrition and exercise should be developed for each patient, in consultation with a registered dietitian. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Nutrition'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-considerations-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional considerations in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Exercise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with diabetes and their families are at increased risk for psychological disorders such as depression and anxiety, which result in poor glycemic control. Addressing these psychosocial issues improves glycemic control. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of follow-up visits is tailored to the needs of the child and family. Visits are more frequent during the initial educational phase, and also if glycemic control is problematic. Ongoing visits allow for continued family education and monitoring for complications of diabetes, including screening for retinopathy, nephropathy, hypertension, and dyslipidemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F97226%7EPEDS%2F90969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97226 graphicRef90969 \">table 5A-B</a>).
