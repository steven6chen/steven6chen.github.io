The initial step in evaluating the patient with monarticular pain is confirming that the source of the pain is the joint, rather than the nearby soft tissues. Arthritis is likely when the pain is aggravated by movement, is associated with loss of motion, and is accompanied by swelling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> erythema. However, deep-seated articulations, such as the shoulder, hip, and sacroiliac joints, may not exhibit the latter two findings. If joint motion is preserved but tenderness can be elicited by palpation over one of the regional bursae, tendons, or ligaments, it is unlikely that the joint pain is due to arthritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bursitis-an-overview-of-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bursitis: An overview of clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of soft tissue rheumatic disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to a careful history and physical examination, arthrocentesis and synovial fluid analysis is often required in making a definitive diagnosis. The initial evaluation and differential diagnosis of an adult presenting with a single sore joint is presented here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F62597\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62597 \">table 1</a>). The approach to a patient with pain in specific joints is addressed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unspecified knee pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-shoulder-complaints\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with shoulder complaints&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-elbow-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of elbow pain in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=history-and-examination-of-the-adult-with-hand-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;History and examination of the adult with hand pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-hip-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with hip pain&quot;</a>). The evaluation of a child with joint pain is also presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-child-with-joint-pain-and-or-swelling\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the child with joint pain and/or swelling&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major causes of acute monoarticular symptoms include trauma, infection, crystal-induced arthritis, osteoarthritis, systemic rheumatic diseases, and mechanical derangement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F62597\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62597 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-monoarthritis-in-adults/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The differential diagnosis of an acute monoarthritis can also overlap with that of polyarthritis since virtually any polyarthritis disorder can initially present as a monoarthritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74266\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74266 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with polyarticular pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trauma sufficient to cause joint pain and swelling is typically recollected by the patient. However, if a loss of consciousness (eg, due to a drug overdose, motor vehicle accident, alcohol ingestion, or concussion) has occurred, the patient may not remember injuring the joint. Thus, if there is a history of joint injury or loss of consciousness, initial immobilization and imaging studies to rule out a fracture or dislocation are appropriately obtained before proceeding with a thorough physical examination of the joint.</p><p>Intraarticular fractures, dislocations, ligamentous sprains and complete tears (eg, of the anterior or posterior cruciate ligaments of the knee), and meniscal damage are often associated with hemarthrosis. Intraarticular bleeding may also be related to coagulopathies, anticoagulation therapy, intraarticular tumors, and crystal disease, among other causes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemarthrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemarthrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H201247765\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Gonococcal infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) typically present with one of two syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F56577\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56577 \">table 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A triad of tenosynovitis, vesiculopustular skin lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71303\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71303 \">picture 1</a>), and polyarthralgias without purulent arthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Purulent arthritis without associated skin lesions</p><p/><p>Diagnosis of this disorder is based upon the history, physical examination, synovial fluid culture, blood cultures, and cultures of any skin lesions, the pharynx, urethra, cervix, or rectum.

These infections typically affect large joints such as the hip and knee, although the wrists and ankles are also commonly involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-monoarthritis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> is the most common bacterium infecting adult joints, followed by <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and, less often, Gram-negative organisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F57688\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57688 \">table 4</a>). Patients who are immunocompromised, inject drugs intravenously, have a prosthetic joint, or have underlying conditions such as neoplasia, chronic renal failure, or rheumatoid arthritis are more susceptible to these infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=septic-arthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Septic arthritis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H201247837\"><span class=\"h3\">Mycobacterial and fungal infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mycobacterial species and fungi can produce an indolent, progressive monoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-monoarthritis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A high index of suspicion is required to establish these diagnoses; immunocompromised status and travel to endemic areas are the primary risk factors. The diagnosis should also be considered if a patient fails to respond to courses of antibiotic therapy or if synovial fluid cultures fail to identify a causative organism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skeletal-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skeletal tuberculosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candida-osteoarticular-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Candida osteoarticular infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of sporotrichosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Arthritis may represent either an articular infection or a sterile extrapulmonary manifestation of either histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of pulmonary histoplasmosis&quot;, section on 'Rheumatologic manifestations'</a>). Arthralgia, usually polyarticular, may accompany the panniculitis of erythema nodosum that can occur with pulmonary infection with these fungal organisms and others.

Clinical difficulties that may arise include the lack of history of a tick bite or an antecedent skin rash. Culture of the synovial fluid or tissue is routinely negative; confirmation of the diagnosis requires serologic testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of Lyme disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Crystal-induced arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At least 80 percent of initial attacks of acute gout involve a single joint, typically in the lower extremity, most often at the base of the great toe (first metatarsophalangeal joint, known as podagra), at the midfoot, in the ankle, or in the knee. However, the fingers, elbows, and wrists may become inflamed and cause diagnostic confusion.</p><p>The typical attack is intensely inflammatory, and is characterized by severe pain, redness, swelling, and disability. The maximal severity of the attack is usually reached over several hours. Complete resolution of the earliest attacks almost inevitably occurs within a few days to weeks, even in untreated individuals. The signs of inflammation associated with acute gout often extend beyond the confines of the joint that is primarily involved and, in the foot or ankles, may give the impression of arthritis in several contiguous joints, of tenosynovitis, or cellulitis. Involvement in an ankle or instep or in a wrist, finger, or olecranon bursa more commonly occurs in a recurrent episode of a gout flare. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The knee is the most common joint involved in patients with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals (pseudogout). The wrist, shoulder, ankle, and occasionally smaller joints may also be targets, and bilateral wrist involvement is common in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-monoarthritis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].
