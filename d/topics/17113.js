Insulin resistance, the associated hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, and adipocyte cytokines (adipokines) may also lead to vascular endothelial dysfunction, an abnormal lipid profile, hypertension, and vascular inflammation, all of which promote the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. A similar profile can be seen in individuals with abdominal obesity who do not have an excess of total body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].</p><p>The co-occurrence of metabolic risk factors for both type 2 diabetes and CVD (abdominal obesity, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension) suggested the existence of a &quot;metabolic syndrome&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x/abstract/1,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9-11</a>]. Other names applied to this constellation of findings have included syndrome X, the insulin resistance syndrome, the deadly quartet, or the obesity dyslipidemia syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Genetic predisposition, lack of exercise, and body fat distribution all affect the likelihood that a given obese subject will become overtly diabetic or develop CVD.</p><p>It should be noted that questions have been raised as to whether the metabolic syndrome, as currently defined, captures any unique pathophysiology implied by calling it a &quot;syndrome&quot; and whether metabolic syndrome confers risk beyond its individual components. These questions raise uncertainty about the value of diagnosing metabolic syndrome in individual patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. These arguments will be reviewed at the end of this discussion (see <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'A critical look at the metabolic syndrome'</a> below). Regardless of whether the metabolic syndrome is considered a unique entity, the need is unquestioned to identify and manage its individual components to decrease morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes and CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>The definition, prevalence, clinical implications, and therapy of the metabolic syndrome will be reviewed here, including the limited data in children and adolescents. The pathogenesis of the relationship between obesity and type 2 diabetes and other causes of insulin resistance are discussed separately.

As in adults, this lack of consensus makes it difficult to compare studies that use different diagnostic criteria and leaves the clinician without any clear parameters for assessing the long-term clinical implications of the metabolic syndrome in children or for tracking the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical implications'</a> above.)</p><p>The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) definition of metabolic syndrome in children 10 to 16 years old is similar to that used by the IDF for adults, except that the definition for adolescents uses ethnic-specific waist circumference percentiles and one cutoff level for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) rather than a sex-specific cutoff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x/abstract/124,125\" class=\"abstract_t\">124,125</a>].

The United States prevalence of metabolic syndrome (defined by the modified Adult Treatment Panel III [ATP III] criteria) is estimated to be approximately 9 percent based upon a National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III survey of 1960 children &gt;12 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>]. However, pubertal growth and development is characterized by changes in metabolic traits that characterize the syndrome, resulting in significant individual variability in the categorical diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x/abstract/127,131\" class=\"abstract_t\">127,131</a>]. In one study of 1098 adolescents, as many as half of the adolescents initially classified as having metabolic syndrome lost the diagnosis during the three-year observation period, while others acquired the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>].</p><p>The racial and ethnic distribution of metabolic syndrome is similar to that seen in adults, with the highest prevalence in Mexican Americans, followed by non-Hispanic whites, and non-Hispanic blacks (12.9, 10.9, and 2.9 percent, respectively). Native Americans may be the ethnic group at greatest risk for metabolic syndrome as illustrated by a population-based study of Canadian Native (Oji-Cree) children and adolescents (10 to 19 years) that reported a 19 percent prevalence rate (defined by ATP III criteria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>].</p><p>Among obese children, the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is high and increases with worsening obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x/abstract/121,122\" class=\"abstract_t\">121,122</a>]. This was illustrated in a study of 439 obese, 31 overweight, and 20 normal-weight children and adolescents who underwent a comprehensive metabolic assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. The metabolic syndrome was present in 39 and 50 percent of the moderately and severely obese subjects, respectively. In contrast, no overweight or normal-weight children met the criteria for the metabolic syndrome.</p><p>Risk factors in childhood that could predict emergence of metabolic syndrome were identified in a longitudinal study of a cohort from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Growth and Health Study (NGHS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. Girls aged 9 and 10 years (n = 1192) were followed for 10 years. Metabolic syndrome (defined by ATP III criteria) was present in 0.2 percent at baseline and in 3.5 percent of black and 2.4 percent of white girls at ages 18 and 19. Waist circumference and serum triglycerides at baseline were predictive of subsequent metabolic syndrome. For every increase of 1 cm in waist circumference at year two, the risk of developing metabolic syndrome increased by 7.4 percent; for every increase of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in triglyceride level at baseline, the risk of metabolic syndrome increased 1.3 percent. Race was not a significant independent factor in this study.</p><p>In summary, the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is high among obese children and adolescents and increases with the severity of the obesity, and with central adiposity in particular. However, there is instability in the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome during pubertal development, making prevalence estimates less reliable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x/abstract/127,134\" class=\"abstract_t\">127,134</a>].

In contrast to the data from adults, therefore, long-term cardiovascular and diabetes risks are not well defined. In one cohort study of 771 adults (mean age 38) who had participated in the Lipid Research Clinics study as children and adolescents 22 to 31 years previously, the incidence of self-reported cardiovascular disease (CVD) was more common in adults who exhibited metabolic syndrome traits as children than in those who did not (19.4 versus 1.5 percent, odds ratio [OR] 14.6, 95% CI 4.8-45.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>]. Of 31 children who had metabolic syndrome traits in the initial study, 21 (68 percent) had adult metabolic syndrome. Increasing body mass index (BMI) was strongly associated with risk of adult metabolic syndrome.</p><p>Thus, the definition of metabolic syndrome may be clinically useful for risk stratification and therapeutic intervention in pediatrics.</p><p>Lifestyle modification that emphasizes reduction of established risk factors, such as promotion of a healthy diet, exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation, is the main therapeutic goal in obese children and adolescents, regardless of a metabolic syndrome diagnosis.

Whether patient benefit is gained from diagnosing patients with a syndrome of such uncertain characteristics or predictive value remains an open question.
