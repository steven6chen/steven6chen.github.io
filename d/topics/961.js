This can help prevent infection. If you are bleeding, press on the wound with a clean towel or bandage to slow or stop the bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41742256\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See a doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You were bitten by a wild animal, such as a raccoon, skunk, woodchuck, fox, coyote, or bat. These animals can carry rabies. It is very important that you see a doctor or nurse right away.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You were bitten by a cat or a person and it broke the skin. (Cat bites often lead to infection. Experts usually recommend antibiotics for anyone bitten by a cat.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You were bitten by a dog or a person on the hand, foot, or head. Also see a doctor or nurse for a dog or human bite anywhere on your body if the wound is deep or large.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You were bitten by any animal and you have diabetes, liver disease, cancer, HIV or AIDS, or you take medicine that could impair your ability to fight infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are bleeding, and it won't stop even after applying pressure for 15 minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You think you might have a broken bone or another serious injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You were bitten on a joint and you can't bend the joint as easily as before.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It has been more than 5 years since you last had a tetanus shot, or you don't remember when your last tetanus shot was. This is a vaccine most people have had at least once. It helps prevent infections that can be caused by bites.</p><p/><p>You should also see a doctor or nurse if you develop signs of infection, which include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain that gets worse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness or warmth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oozing pus from the wound</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41742263\"><span class=\"h1\">How are animal bites treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you get treated for a bite, your doctor or nurse will first clean and disinfect your wound. Depending on how big the wound is and where it is, he or she might also put in stitches. Plus, you might get antibiotics to prevent infection, but they are not always needed.</p><p>Some people who are bitten need a &quot;booster shot&quot; of the tetanus vaccine. The tetanus booster is especially important for people who got their last booster more than 5 years ago.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41742270\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I worry about rabies?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you were bitten by an animal that could be infected with rabies, you should get a series of shots to prevent rabies. You could be at risk for rabies if you were bitten by a:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dog, cat, or ferret that you know or think has rabies</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wild animal, such as a raccoon, fox, skunk, woodchuck, coyote, or bat. (Bat bites are especially likely to carry rabies. But bat bites are also hard to see.)</p><p/><p>If you were bitten by a farm animal or large rodent, call your doctor or nurse for advice. The risk of these types of bites is decided on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Do not worry about rabies if you were bitten by a lizard, fish, or other animal that does not have fur. Animals without fur (besides humans) cannot carry rabies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41742277\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insect-bites-and-stings-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Insect bites and stings (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=animal-and-human-bites-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Animal and human bites (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Rabies (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
