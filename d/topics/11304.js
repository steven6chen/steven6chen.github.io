We typically monitor HBV DNA and aminotransferases every three months until undetectable for at least two consecutive visits. We then decrease the frequency to every six months. </p><p>Studies in patients with HBV alone have demonstrated that normalization of aminotransferases and suppression of HBV DNA (with or without HBeAg seroconversion) are associated with improvements in liver histology and lower rates of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

A more detailed discussion of the significance of HBeAg is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;, section on 'Phases of chronic HBV infection'</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are HBeAg positive should have HBeAg and anti-HBe testing repeated every six months to determine if seroconversion (loss of HBeAg with gain of anti-HBe) has occurred. Seroconversion implies a transition from active liver disease to an inactive carrier state. Some HIV-uninfected patients with chronic HBV may be able to receive a finite course of therapy if seroconversion occurs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management#H34\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management&quot;, section on 'Duration and treatment endpoints'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, most HBeAg-positive HIV-infected patients are taking HBV-active agents as part of their combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen. Thus, knowledge of seroconversion is only useful if ART needs to be altered in the future due to HIV drug resistance or medication toxicity. In addition, if HBV-active drugs are discontinued, the patient may still be at risk for HBV reactivation and seroreversion, which is associated with rebound viremia and flares of hepatitis. These observations suggest the need for chronic HBV therapy, regardless of HBeAg status.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No monitoring of HBeAg or anti-HBe is required in HBeAg-negative patients; only HBV DNA. In general, HBeAg-negative patients require chronic HBV therapy for an indefinite period of time, regardless of HIV status, since treatment discontinuation is usually associated with virologic rebound. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management#H34\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management&quot;, section on 'Duration and treatment endpoints'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33402304\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatitis B surface antigen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ultimate goal of HBV therapy is to achieve HBsAg seroconversion, but this occurs in the minority of patients, regardless of HIV status. Annual testing of HBsAg in patients with ongoing HBV DNA suppression is reasonable. If HBsAg seroconversion occurs and ART needs to be altered, then an anti-HBV drug does not need to be included in the new ART regimen, provided the patient has had 6 to 12 months of anti-HBV therapy after HBsAg seroconversion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33402493\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING FOR HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We screen <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HBV-coinfected</span> patients for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) the same way we screen HBV-monoinfected patients.

During HBV therapy, it is reasonable to assay for HCV RNA, particularly if aminotransferases rise despite declining HBV DNA levels. However, in one small study of 21 HIV-infected patients with HBV and HCV coinfection, re-emergence of the less dominant virus was uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>In the unusual case where a patient with <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HBV/HCV</span> tri-infection is not on HBV-active antiretroviral therapy and receives direct-acting antiviral therapy for HCV, reactivation of HBV may occur. Reactivation has been reported in <span class=\"nowrap\">HBV/HCV-coinfected</span> patients who are either positive only for hepatitis B core antibody (isolated-anti-HBc-positive) or are hepatitis B surface antigen-positive with low or undetectable HBV DNA levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, if such patients are not started on HBV-active antiretroviral therapy before receiving HCV therapy, these patients should be monitored closely for HBV reactivation.

Risk factors for HBV-related immune reconstitution include a high level of HBV viremia and a low CD4 count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Close laboratory monitoring of aminotransferases is suggested during the first three months of therapy (eg, every six weeks), particularly in those with low CD4 cell counts. </p><p>Most cases of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome resolve uneventfully; however, the patient with cirrhosis is at risk for decompensation and should be monitored closely during the first three to six months of therapy. Additional testing for prothrombin time in a cirrhotic patient with marked increases in aminotransferases is prudent. If the patient decompensates, they should be seen in a transplant center as soon as possible.

During replication, HBV mutations arise at a frequency of 1 per 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> nucleotides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The combination of these two factors leads to a swarm of viral variants called &quot;quasispecies,&quot; similar to that described for HIV and hepatitis C viruses (HCV). However, despite the high HBV mutation rate, the emergence of drug resistance occurs more slowly for HBV than for HIV or HCV. This may be related to several factors, including slow turnover of covalently closed circular DNA in chronically infected hepatocytes, the constraints on HBV evolution imposed by its overlapping reading frames, and the effect of the host immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Drug resistance is inferred when a &ge;1 log(10) international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> increase in viral load from nadir is documented on two consecutive serum samples collected at least one month apart in patients who initially responded to and are compliant with therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Identification of antiviral resistance involves the detection of mutations in the HBV genome (typically polymerase) that have been selected during treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Many clinical laboratories now combine resistance testing with genotyping. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical significance of hepatitis B virus genotypes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Drug resistance is most common in patients who had or have a detectable HBV DNA while on antiretroviral therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> as the only HBV-active agent. Some experts recommend drug resistance testing, especially if the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a> is being considered, since entecavir has overlapping resistance patterns with lamivudine.
