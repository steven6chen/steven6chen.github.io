The optimum time for delivery balances these benefits with the risk of delivering an infant who could benefit from further in utero maturation. Since exposure to labor (even if prior to cesarean delivery) is associated with a lower rate of neonatal respiratory morbidity, it is particularly important to schedule planned cesarean deliveries when gestational age-related respiratory morbidity is minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repeat-cesarean-delivery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2548861577\"><span class=\"h2\">Women with a medical indication for early delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Timing of medically indicated repeat cesarean delivery is determined by the <span class=\"nowrap\">medical/obstetrical</span> indication (eg, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, alloimmunization, cholestasis of pregnancy). (Refer to topic reviews on each disorder).</p><p>A consensus panel of experts did not consider &ldquo;soft&rdquo; indications for intervention, such as suspected macrosomia in the absence of maternal diabetes or a problem in a previous pregnancy that has not recurred, reasonable medical indications for delivery before 39 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repeat-cesarean-delivery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3140904347\"><span class=\"h2\">Women with no medical indication for early delivery</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20290923\"><span class=\"h3\">Previous low transverse uterine incision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In women with one or more previous lower uterine segment hysterotomies, the optimum time for repeat cesarean delivery appears to be in the 39th week of gestation (39<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7ths</span> </sup>to 39<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">6/7ths</sup>)</span>. Compared with earlier (37 to 38 weeks) or later (&ge;40 weeks) term delivery, scheduled delivery during the 39th week results in a very low rate of adverse neonatal outcome while minimizing the risk that spontaneous labor will ensue; the risk of postterm stillbirth is completely avoided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-preoperative-planning-and-patient-preparation#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Preoperative planning and patient preparation&quot;, section on 'Scheduling'</a>.)</p><p>There is consensus that elective delivery should be avoided in the 37<sup>th</sup> week, but the benefits of waiting until 39 weeks versus delivery in the 38<sup>th</sup> week are less well-defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repeat-cesarean-delivery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. We agree with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendation to not perform non-medically indicated deliveries before 39 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repeat-cesarean-delivery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This recommendation is supported by a multicenter prospective study on timing of cesarean delivery including over 24,000 repeat cesarean deliveries at term, of which over 13,000 were performed electively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repeat-cesarean-delivery/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of the composite primary outcome (neonatal respiratory problems, hypoglycemia, sepsis, seizures, intensive care unit admission, hospitalization &ge;5 days, etc) by gestational age at planned repeat cesarean delivery was 15.3 percent at 37 weeks, 11.0 percent at 38 weeks, 8.0 percent at 39 weeks, 7.3 percent at 40 weeks, 11.3 percent at 41 weeks, and 19.5 percent at &ge;42 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repeat-cesarean-delivery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

No trials have compared different gestational ages for repeat cesarean. In a review of 10 studies that included complete information about pregnancy outcome in 372 patients with prior low vertical cesarean deliveries and subsequent trial of labor, four uterine ruptures (1.05 percent) were reported, but only one of these occurred after a single prior unextended low segment vertical cesarean incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repeat-cesarean-delivery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Two ruptures occurred elsewhere on the lateral or posterior aspect of the uterus in subsequent pregnancies, and the fourth rupture occurred at the juncture of prior low vertical and transverse incisions. The authors concluded that, in an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy, the patient with one previous unextended low segment vertical cesarean incision should receive the same care, counseling, and caution as a patient with a prior low transverse incision. </p><p>Based on these data, we perform repeat cesarean in the 39<sup>th</sup> week of gestation in women with a prior lower segment vertical incision. However, if review of the operative report, patient report, or clinical setting of the previous delivery suggests that the thick muscular part of the uterus was likely involved in the vertical incision, we would perform the repeat cesarean at 37 to 38 weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Previous classical incision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the stable patient with a previous classical uterine incision, repeat cesarean delivery is recommended at 36<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7ths</span> </sup>to 37<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">6/7ths</span> </sup>weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repeat-cesarean-delivery/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. We suggest not assessing fetal pulmonary maturity by amniocentesis, given the risk of amniocentesis, as well as the ongoing risk of uterine rupture as the uterus continues to enlarge and onset of spontaneous labor becomes more likely. Another option is to administer a complete course of antenatal corticosteroids and then perform the cesarean delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antenatal-corticosteroid-therapy-for-reduction-of-neonatal-respiratory-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preterm-delivery#H2439085123\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery&quot;, section on '34+0 or more weeks'</a>.)</p><p>No randomized trials have evaluated the optimum timing of delivery in women with a prior classical hysterotomy incision. Intervention before 39 weeks of gestation may reduce the risk of uterine rupture associated with spontaneous labor at term. However, early delivery can also lead to complications from prematurity and may not prevent uterine rupture since it has been reported as early as the second trimester and up to 50 percent of uterine ruptures will occur prior to labor onset.</p><p>A decision analysis attempted to address the issue of timing delivery after a previous classical hysterotomy incision by analyzing the following four options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repeat-cesarean-delivery/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delivery at 36 weeks of gestation without amniocentesis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amniocentesis at 36 weeks of gestation with delivery if the fetus is mature and 48 hours after antenatal corticosteroids if the fetus is immature</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weekly amniocentesis starting at 36 weeks of gestation with delivery upon fetal lung maturity</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delivery at 39 weeks of gestation </p><p/><p>The authors concluded the strategy of delivery at 36 weeks of gestation without amniocentesis provided the lowest risk of a maternal-neonatal catastrophic outcome associated with uterine rupture. Their rationale was that although complications of prematurity at 36 weeks of gestation occur more frequently than uterine rupture, these complications are often minor and transient, and therefore not as detrimental to maternal-neonatal quality of life. In this model, there was no benefit of offering fetal lung maturity testing because it would lead, in cases of negative results, to further expectant management in a risky situation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19464654\"><span class=\"h3\">Unknown location of previous incision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the location of the prior incision is unknown (no operative note, patient was not told incision site), the obstetrical history should be reviewed with the patient (gestational age at delivery, birthweight, fetal presentation, pregnancy complications, surgeons comments about the delivery). If she reports a history of a term delivery of an infant more than five pounds, then there is a high probability that the incision was low transverse, especially if there is also a transverse skin incision, and it is reasonable to schedule the repeat cesarean in the 39<sup>th</sup> week of gestation. This approach is supported by a review of 393 patients who underwent a trial of labor after one or more previous cesarean deliveries where 300 patients had an unknown uterine scar, 88 patients had a documented low cervical transverse incision, and 5 patients had a prior low vertical incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repeat-cesarean-delivery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients with an unknown prior uterine incision had comparable outcomes as those with a known prior low transverse incision. </p><p>A classical hysterotomy should be suspected if the lower uterine segment was likely to be poorly developed at the time of the previous cesarean (eg, delivery of breech fetus remote from term) or the patient had known pathology of the lower uterine segment (eg, large leiomyoma). In one large study, 50 percent of women who underwent cesarean delivery at 23 to 26 weeks had a classical hysterotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repeat-cesarean-delivery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>As discussed above, in the stable patient with a previous classical uterine incision, we perform repeat cesarean delivery at 36<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7ths</span> </sup>to 37<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">6/7ths</span> </sup>weeks of gestation.

A systematic review found increased maternal morbidity with increasing number of cesarean deliveries, regardless of placental status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repeat-cesarean-delivery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The rate of blood transfusions, adhesions, surgical injury, and hysterectomy all increased with the increasing number of cesareans. We place at least two large-bore intravenous lines in these women <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a history of dense adhesions. Placement of a three-way bladder catheter can be useful in high order repeat cesarean deliveries or deliveries where dense adhesions are suspected because of the increased risk of cystotomy. For patients with four or more prior cesarean deliveries or with a history of intraoperative complications, it is prudent to have a general surgeon or an experienced gynecologic surgeon readily available to assist, if needed. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">OPERATIVE ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Issues related to operative techniques common to both primary and repeat cesarean, including opening the abdomen, bladder flap, hysterotomy, delivery of the fetus and placenta, closure, and prevention of adhesions, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Surgical technique&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H871035522\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin incision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We generally use the site of the previous transverse skin incision for repeat procedures, whenever possible. We would consider a midline vertical incision for some emergency cesarean deliveries and in cases of suspected placenta previa or accreta, where a vertical incision may provide both more rapid and better exposure of the uterus. For patients with a prior vertical skin incision, we usually perform a transverse skin incision at the repeat cesarean, but use of the previous vertical incision site is acceptable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repeat-cesarean-delivery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3528117703\"><span class=\"h2\">Entering the pelvis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Formation of adhesions is common after cesarean delivery, and the extent and density increase with increasing numbers of repeat cesarean deliveries: the reported prevalence of adhesions is 12 to 46 percent of women at their second cesarean and 26 to 75 percent of women at their third cesarean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repeat-cesarean-delivery/abstract/15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-20</a>]. Because adhesions are often present in women with prior abdominal surgery, the fascia and peritoneum should be entered carefully to avoid injury to underlying, possibly adherent bowel or bladder. A surgeon experienced in complex abdominal surgery should be present if meticulous dissection of dense adhesions involving important structures is needed. Some clinicians find insertion of ureteral stents can be useful to facilitate intraoperative identification (and avoidance) of the ureters. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique#H20293380\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Surgical technique&quot;, section on 'Avoiding visceral injury in patients with dense intraperitoneal adhesions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3301171854\"><span class=\"h2\">Hysterotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideally, the hysterotomy is performed through a low transverse incision at repeat cesarean, even if prior cesareans were performed using a vertical or classical uterine incision.

Repair of multiple cystotomy incisions or injury to the trigone is more complex; consultation with a urologist can be helpful to evaluate the urinary tract and assist with the repair. Similarly, if bowel injury occurs, we consult a general surgeon to evaluate the bowel and assist in the repair. Obstetricians proficient in these repairs may choose to undertake the repair without assistance.

The risks of blood transfusion, cystotomy, and hysterectomy are each &gt;1 percent after the third cesarean in one of the biggest series (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80662\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80662 \">table 1</a>). However, there are insufficient data on which to base recommendations for the &quot;safe&quot; number of repeat cesarean deliveries. </p><p>Several issues should be considered and discussed with the patient preoperatively:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications relating to abnormal placentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a meta-analysis of observational studies, an increasing number of prior cesarean deliveries was strongly associated with an increased risk of abnormal placentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repeat-cesarean-delivery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The risk of placenta previa after 1 and after &ge;3 cesarean deliveries was <span class=\"nowrap\">10/1000</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">28/1000,</span> respectively. The risk of placenta accreta in women with placenta previa and no cesarean deliveries and after &ge;4 cesarean deliveries was 3 to 4 percent and 50 to 67 percent, respectively. Both of these placental disorders increase the risk of hemorrhage and the need for blood transfusion and hysterectomy.</p><p>The largest prospective study of maternal morbidity associated with multiple cesarean deliveries provides additional insights [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repeat-cesarean-delivery/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This study included 6201 first; 15,808 second; 6324 third; 1452 fourth; 258 fifth; and 89 sixth cesarean deliveries. The odds of placenta previa and accreta progressively increased with the number of cesarean deliveries, and women with placenta previa were at very high risk of also having placenta accreta (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80662\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80662 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51302\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51302 \">table 2</a>). The risk of peripartum hysterectomy at the fourth cesarean delivery was 1 in 40, increasing to 1 in 11 at the sixth cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repeat-cesarean-delivery/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Placental abruption is another example of a placental abnormality that occurs more often in women with a prior cesarean birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repeat-cesarean-delivery/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]; however, the risk of abruption does not appear to increase with increasing numbers of prior cesarean deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repeat-cesarean-delivery/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

However, the degree of adhesion formation after a cesarean delivery varies widely among individuals and is unpredictable.</p><p>The presence of dense adhesions can make the surgical procedure and fetal extraction more difficult, prolong the time to delivery, and increase the risk of surgical complications, such as bowel or bladder injury and excessive blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repeat-cesarean-delivery/abstract/17,18,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,28-30</a>]. In the large prospective study described above, the incidence of cystotomy increased from 0.13 percent after a primary cesarean delivery to 1.94 percent after the fifth cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repeat-cesarean-delivery/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Adhesions may cause the bladder to densely adhere to the lower uterine segment, eliminating the usual plane for blunt dissection, or they may distort the position of the bladder so that it is adherent to the midportion of the uterus. Cystotomy is more likely if an atypically located bladder is not recognized.

A small but serious risk is uterine rupture.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women with a previous hysterotomy in the lower uterine segment and an uncomplicated pregnancy, we suggest scheduling repeat cesarean delivery during the 39th week of gestation (39<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7ths</span> </sup>to 39<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">6/7ths</sup>)</span> rather than at 38<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7ths</span> </sup>to 38<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">6/7ths</sup></span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This minimizes the risk of neonatal respiratory problems, but accepts a low risk that spontaneous labor will occur before the scheduled date of surgery. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Timing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20290923\" class=\"local\">'Previous low transverse uterine incision'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If review of the operative report, patient report, or clinical setting of the previous delivery suggests that the thick muscular part of the uterus was likely involved in an otherwise low vertical hysterotomy incision, we perform repeat cesarean at 37 to 38 weeks. (See <a href=\"#H19464571\" class=\"local\">'Previous low vertical incision'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In stable patients with a previous classical uterine incision, we suggest repeat cesarean delivery at 36<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7ths</span> </sup>to 37<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">6/7ths</span> </sup>weeks of gestation , without confirmation of fetal lung maturity (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This minimizes the risk of uterine rupture related to spontaneous labor, but also reduces the risk of complications related to preterm birth &lt;36 weeks. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Previous classical incision'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If documentation of the type of prior hysterotomy is not available, the clinician should obtain a thorough history of the delivery from the patient and use this information to estimate the most likely location of the prior incision. Timing of repeat cesarean is based on this estimate. (See <a href=\"#H19464654\" class=\"local\">'Unknown location of previous incision'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no threshold below which the number of repeat cesarean deliveries can be guaranteed to be uncomplicated. Our approach is to discuss the increasing risk of complications with increasing numbers of cesarean deliveries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80662\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80662 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51302\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51302 \">table 2</a>). We inform each patient that the risk of placenta accreta rises in direct proportion to the number of previous cesareans, and this risk is dramatically increased if placenta previa is also present.
