Functional constipation is an umbrella term that encompasses a group of disorders associated with persistent, difficult, infrequent, or seemingly incomplete defecation without evidence of a structural or biochemical explanation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57882\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57882 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Fecal incontinence, also known as encopresis or soiling, refers to the repetitive (voluntary or involuntary) passage of stool in children four years of age and older, at which time a child may be reasonably expected to have completed toilet training and to exercise bowel control. Fecal incontinence is usually associated with chronic constipation and functional fecal retention. However, it may occur in the absence of fecal retention, in which case it is termed non-retentive fecal incontinence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation#H6003059\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional fecal incontinence in infants and children: Definition, clinical manifestations and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Functional fecal incontinence'</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of chronic functional constipation and fecal incontinence in infants and children will be discussed here. Related material is presented in the following topic reviews:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional fecal incontinence in infants and children: Definition, clinical manifestations and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-infants-and-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constipation in infants and children: Evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional constipation in infants and children: Clinical features and differential diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-acute-constipation-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of acute constipation in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF INFANTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Constipation is treated somewhat differently in infants as compared with children. When constipation presents early in life, the clinician should be particularly alert for evidence of organic disease, including cystic fibrosis and Hirschsprung disease. Guidelines and an algorithm for diagnosing and treating constipation in infants were developed by the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) and European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN), and are included in a clinical guideline at the NASPGHAN website (<a href=\"http://www.naspghan.org/&amp;token=gdEMl/3RV4q6xsBHuH4h8lN+10OUJ0PV/XvgTiTqR8SvALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=5873\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.naspghan.org</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The functional and organic causes of constipation in infants are discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis#H704003529\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional constipation in infants and children: Clinical features and differential diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Infants with functional constipation frequently respond to treatment with nondigestible osmotically active carbohydrates, such as sorbitol-containing juices (eg, apple, prune, or pear). Dark corn syrup has been used in the past. However, preparations of dark corn syrup may not contain the glycoproteins that are fermented into osmotically active particles in the colon, so the syrup may be ineffective for treating constipation. If these measures are unsuccessful, addition of osmotic laxatives <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> occasional disimpaction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glycerin</a> suppositories can be useful. However, glycerin suppositories should be used with caution because they can enhance anal irritation and cause the symptoms to become chronic.<strong> </strong>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-acute-constipation-in-infants-and-children#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of acute constipation in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Infants'</a> and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Laxatives'</a> below.)</p><p>The choice of medications for treatment of functional constipation in infants is similar to that in children (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of children'</a> below). </p><p>However, there are some important differences in treatment decisions for infants:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osmotic laxatives such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lactulose</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sorbitol</a> are frequently used and are usually effective in infants. The use of polyethylene glycol without electrolytes (PEG-3350, or Miralax) for infants and toddlers &lt;24 months of age was reported in two small case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The treatment was generally effective and no adverse effects were noted in either study. The mean effective maintenance dose was approximately 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> body weight per day. Thus, experience with polyethylene glycol is increasing in infants, although the safety is less well established than with older age groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mineral-oil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Mineral oil</a> is not recommended in infants, or in other children prone to gastroesophageal reflux, because of potential risks of pneumonitis if aspirated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of enemas and stimulant laxatives (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bisacodyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">bisacodyl</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=senna-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">senna</a>) are also not recommended in this age group because of potential complications.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF CHILDREN</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of chronic functional constipation and fecal incontinence typically requires a comprehensive program, including the use of laxatives, behavior changes, and dietary changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/2,5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5-10</a>]. Multimodal therapy is particularly helpful for children who have gone several days between bowel movements, have an anal fissure with bleeding, or have very large-diameter stools with marked straining. The type and intensity of the intervention should be tailored to the severity of constipation and the child's developmental stage, and close follow-up is often necessary. </p><p>Treatment for chronic constipation is based on the concept that chronic constipation causes the colon to be unresponsive to stool burden, due to distension. It follows that effective treatment requires consistent and complete emptying of the colon, so that it becomes conditioned to work on its own, a concept known as &quot;bowel retraining&quot;. There are four general steps in bowel retraining: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disimpaction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged laxative treatment and behavior therapy to achieve regular evacuation and avoid recurrent constipation </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary changes (primarily increasing fiber content) to maintain soft stools</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gradual tapering and withdrawal of laxatives as tolerated</p><p/><p>The goal of therapy is the passage of soft stools, ideally once per day, and no less than every other day. This goal of frequent defecation is important to overcome constipation, although less frequent defecation patterns are common and acceptable in children without a history of constipation. Weeks to months, and sometimes years, of laxative and behavior therapy may be necessary before this goal is achieved. The child's parents or caretakers must be effectively educated about bowel retraining and behavior modification so that they can carry out the sustained treatment. Ultimately, improvement can be expected in most patients. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The combined laxative and behavioral approach has been used since the 1960s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It has been evaluated in only a few controlled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>] but is largely supported by cohort studies, case-control studies, and clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/15-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-22</a>]. Analysis of intervention trials is complicated by the varied methods used for laxative and behavioral treatments. Consequently, conclusions also vary, but generally support the use of combination therapy with both of these modalities. As an example, a large study found that the combination of behavioral intervention and laxative therapy was more effective than behavioral therapy alone (achievement of remission: 63 versus 43 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Another study showed that combination therapy was more effective than laxative therapy alone (improvement rates: 78 versus 45 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], whereas a similar randomized study did not show such an effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A systematic review concluded that combined behavioral and laxative treatment was more effective than either intervention alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Evidence supporting biofeedback was lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>].</p><p>Guidelines for management of infants and children with constipation were developed by the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN), and European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These guidelines include a management algorithm, and are available at the society's website (<a href=\"http://www.naspghan.org/&amp;token=gdEMl/3RV4q6xsBHuH4h8lN+10OUJ0PV/XvgTiTqR8SvALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=5873\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.naspghan.org</a>). </p><p>The following tables summarize a typical treatment plan for children with chronic constipation; details are provided in the remainder of this topic review:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with chronic constipation but without overflow fecal incontinence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61175\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61175 \">table 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with chronic constipation and fecal incontinence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54749\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54749 \">table 3</a>) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Parental education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective education of the parents and child with regard to constipation is crucial in changing chronic behavior patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/2,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,24</a>]. Treatment requires a team approach involving the patient, family, and healthcare provider [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A primary goal is to remove negative attributions. The parent or caretaker must understand that soiling due to overflow incontinence does not constitute willful and defiant behavior by the child but represents physiologic loss of continence. The child should therefore not be scolded, or otherwise punished, for soiling episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. In toddlers with constipation, toilet training should be postponed since it will not be successful until rectal awareness is restored and defecation is pain free [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis#H703999406\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional constipation in infants and children: Clinical features and differential diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>The child's parent or caretaker should be provided with verbal and printed information. Printed information should be written in easy-to-understand lay language, with descriptions of the problem and the methods that will be used to solve it. The following diagram can be used to explain how and why the constipation became chronic, how constipation can cause encopresis, and the concept of bowel retraining (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74718\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74718 \">figure 1</a>). The clinician can use this to explain that once the constipation has been relieved, it may be some time before the nerves in the colon readjust and the child learns to sense stool in the rectum and to properly coordinate the newly conditioned muscles. The predominant theme of the management program is that of rebuilding the rectal muscles to control the bowels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Parents should be advised that this process can take as long as six months to several years. Because parents are often concerned about the safety of long-term laxative use, it is important to explain the need for laxatives and the safety of the type of laxative that will be prescribed. Regular follow-up and ongoing support and encouragement to the parents and child during periodic office visits or phone conversations are essential. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p>In severe cases, the parents <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinician may need to enlist the help of the school and teacher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Some children may benefit from access to a private bathroom. The teacher should be sensitive to the child's problem, permitting him or her to use the bathroom whenever requested (often by a prearranged, unobtrusive signal to avoid drawing attention). In addition, it may be helpful to have a change of clothing available in case a soiling episode occurs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Disimpaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Fecal impaction&quot; is a term used to describe markedly increased amounts of stool in the colon, which is a subjective judgement based on clinical findings. </p><p>The majority of children who come to medical attention because of chronic constipation have fecal impaction, and will benefit from a regimen to disimpact the rectum before beginning maintenance therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/2,24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,24,27</a>]. This step is sometimes described as a &quot;clean-out&quot; in discussions with patients and their family. We suggest a disimpaction step for children with any of the following characteristics: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constipation-associated fecal incontinence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant stool mass palpable on digital rectal or abdominal examination, or on abdominal radiograph</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of incomplete or infrequent evacuation </p><p/><p>Disimpaction and catharsis can be effectively accomplished with oral or nasogastric medications, rectal medications, or a combination. The parents and child should be involved in the decision regarding the appropriate route [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Disimpaction can usually be performed in the outpatient setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. It is important to assess the response to the regimen as soon as possible after it is completed. Successful disimpaction is usually indicated by abundant fecal production and decreased episodes of soiling, as reported by the parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Hospitalization may be necessary if several attempts of outpatient management have failed to yield abundant stool. Inpatient regimens may include nasogastric administration of a balanced electrolyte solution (eg, GoLYTELY) to flush out the colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. If the there is a large impaction by exam or radiograph, it is prudent to first remove some stool distally by digital disimpaction, rectal softening (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mineral-oil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mineral oil</a> retention enema), stimulant rectal suppositories, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> enemas. In this setting, beginning nasogastric solutions first may result in vomiting. Pulsed irrigation enhanced-evacuation systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] and enemas with Gastrografin are other techniques that have been successfully used for disimpaction when standard oral and rectal disimpaction regimens described above have not been successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. These enemas can be administered in or out of the hospital. Consultation with a pediatric gastroenterologist should be considered if disimpaction is unsuccessful or if hospitalization is necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H49128471\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For children with fecal impaction, we generally suggest oral medications for disimpaction because this method is noninvasive and may help the child feel in control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Oral medications also are particularly valuable for children with a history of painful defecation, perineal trauma, or difficulty tolerating enemas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/5,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,28</a>]. However, adherence with the necessary volume may be difficult, and two to three days (up to a maximum of six days, sometimes split between two weekends) of treatment are often needed to achieve complete disimpaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>Polyethylene glycol (PEG) without electrolytes, PEG-electrolyte solutions, or high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mineral-oil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mineral oil</a> have all been shown to be effective for initial disimpaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/28,34-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,34-39</a>]. The PEG without electrolytes is generally the most palatable of these options and better accepted by children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The doses are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyethylene-glycol-3350-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Polyethylene glycol 3350</a> (PEG without electrolytes; Miralax and others) &ndash; 1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> by mouth for up to six days. The daily dose is dissolved in approximately 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> body weight of water or flavored beverage. In a randomized placebo-controlled study, these doses successfully disimpacted 95 percent of children with chronic constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. For patients with inadequate disimpaction using six days of PEG-based treatment at home, rectal medications, or PEG-electrolyte cleanout in the hospital should be considered. Of note, PEG 3350 was found to be as effective as enemas in treating impaction, but children treated with PEG had more fecal incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Further safety studies are needed before this approach can be recommended in infants. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyethylene-glycol-electrolyte-solution-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution</a> (eg, GoLYTELY) &ndash; 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour to a maximum of 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hr</span> by nasogastric tube until stool appears clear, or 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour for four hours per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. We suggest nasogastric administration because most children are not able to take sufficient quantities of this solution by mouth.

However, the toileting regimen can be started sooner or later, depending on the child's readiness. If the child fails to have a bowel movement for several days, it may be necessary to use an enema to empty the rectum and then increase the laxative dose.

The effective dose in an individual patient is not predictable, and many patients require relatively high doses for initial treatment of constipation, with somewhat lower maintenance doses. Therefore, we suggest an empiric approach to dosing. In our practice, we use an initial dose of 4 tsp (17 g = approximately 3.5 tsp) for patients weighing 20 kg or more, increased or decreased by <span class=\"nowrap\">1/2</span> tsp to 1 tsp every other day until the consistency of the stools is soft to loose. We have rarely had to use more than 6 to 7 tsp per day. For patients weighing less than 20 kg, it is reasonable to use a slightly lower initial dose (0.4 to 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day),</span> with dose adjustments up or down to achieve soft stools. Further dose-ranging trials are needed to determine optimal dosing, especially in children requiring long-term PEG treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. </p><p>Clinical trials indicate that PEG without electrolytes has efficacy greater than or similar to that of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lactulose</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-hydroxide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">magnesium hydroxide</a> with fewer adverse effects and greater acceptance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/36,62,68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,62,68,69</a>].

Stimulant laxatives also may be helpful for patients with anorectal malformations or other disorders that affect anorectal innervation, which can affect sensory and motor function and predispose to both constipation and fecal incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3942235\"><span class=\"h3\">Newer pharmacological agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newer drugs that are used for adults with chronic constipation include the secretory agents <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linaclotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linaclotide</a> (Linzess), a guanylate cyclase receptor agonist, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lubiprostone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lubiprostone</a> (Amitiza), a chloride channel activator.

A sample of such a diary and a blank one that can be printed out for use by the child&rsquo;s caregivers are shown in the following figures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62849%7EPEDS%2F53073\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62849 graphicRef53073 \">figure 2A-B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the treatment of fecal incontinence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic constipation, it is important to ingest a diet that is conducive to fecal regularity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/2,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,24</a>]. Increased intake of fruit and raw vegetables, bran, and whole-grain breads and cereals is commonly recommended, as is adequate intake of fluids other than milk. However, the evidence supporting these interventions is weak, especially in moderate to severe constipation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Fiber</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasing the intake of fiber, through dietary changes or fiber supplements, is often recommended for acute and chronic constipation. However, the evidence base for this practice is weak and somewhat conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/2,87-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,87-91</a>]. This may be because dietary fiber can have either beneficial or adverse effects in children with constipation, especially in the setting of chronic constipation and recurrent impactions. On the one hand, fiber adds bulk and water content to the stool; this can make the stool softer and easier to release. On the other hand, the increased stool bulk also may cause greater distension of the rectum and colon in children with fecal retention, and interfere with the child's ability to sense the need to defecate. Moreover, if there is inadequate accompanying fluid intake, impactions can occur.</p><p>Therefore, we suggest a balanced diet that includes whole grains, fruits, and vegetables as a component of the treatment of constipation in children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76461%7EPEDS%2F77796\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76461 graphicRef77796 \">table 5A-B</a>). Dietary changes should not be forced, nor should they replace the other interventions described above. It is reasonable to avoid dietary changes in the initial management in order to limit the battle fronts to medications and toileting behaviors. For children with acute or mild chronic constipation, a reasonable target for dietary fiber can be calculated as the child's age plus 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/day</span> (ie, 11 to 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/day</span> for a six year old child). Giving more than this fiber goal has no proven benefit for management of constipation in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-acute-constipation-in-infants-and-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of acute constipation in infants and children&quot;, section on 'School entry'</a>). For children with a history of fecal impaction, extra fiber intake should be encouraged only after colorectal tone has been restored, eg, after several months of successful treatment with laxatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Adequate intake of fiber may be particularly important during the time that laxative therapy is discontinued, when the increased stool bulk may raise the child's awareness of the need to evacuate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Supplementation with glucomannan was a useful adjunct to disimpaction and behavioral interventions in a small, randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. If necessary, a variety of fiber products are available over the counter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64009\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64009 \">table 6</a>). These include powdered fiber that can be mixed in juice (and frozen into popsicles), wafers, or tablets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Fluid intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no evidence that constipation can be successfully treated by increasing fluid intake unless the patient is clinically dehydrated. To ensure adequate hydration, children with chronic constipation or fecal incontinence should be encouraged to consume at least 32 to 64 ounces (960 to 1920 mL) of water or other non-milk liquids per day, particularly if they are using fiber supplements.</p><p>Whether increasing fluids beyond the usual intake affects constipation is unclear. In one study, 108 prepubertal children (2 to 12 years of age) with moderate to severe simple constipation were randomly assigned to one of three groups: one was instructed to increase daily water intake by 50 percent; the second was asked to ingest additional hyperosmolar liquids such as juices; and the third to make no changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].

If the constipation improves substantially, the diet should be continued. A non-dairy form of milk (eg, soy) can be used as a substitute. </p><p>We suggest this approach because eliminating cow's milk from the diet improves constipation in some children. This is particularly true in children with atopic symptoms, probably because of an occult cow's milk intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,94</a>]. In one double-blind crossover study in 65 constipated children who were refractory to laxative therapy, 68 percent of children improved while receiving soy milk compared with cow's milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>]. Constipation recurred within days of reintroduction of cow's milk. Another study suggested that constipation can be a delayed clinical manifestation of cows' milk protein intolerance, particularly in children with a personal or family history of atopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. </p><p>Although not clinically proven, it is also possible that excessive consumption of milk may contribute to constipation in some children, even in the absence of cow's milk protein intolerance. The proposed mechanism is that cow's milk slows intestinal motility and satiates the child, thereby diminishing the intake of other fluids and fiber-containing foods. This mechanism may be most relevant for toddlers, who are most likely to have a high intake of milk and low intake of dietary fiber. Therefore, we recommend limiting the intake of cow's milk to 24 fluid ounces (720 mL) per day.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases#H700205307\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Probiotics for gastrointestinal diseases&quot;, section on 'Constipation'</a>.)</p><p>The hypothesis that probiotics may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of constipation is supported by data demonstrating differences in the intestinal microbiota between healthy individuals and patients with chronic constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Administration of <em>Bifidobacterium</em> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactobacillus-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Lactobacillus</a> has also been shown to improve colonic transit times in constipated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,101</a>]. Only a few clinical trials have addressed the use of probiotics for constipation, with mixed results. A randomized trial in 60 children found that the addition of <em>Lactobacillus sporogenes</em> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mineral-oil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mineral oil</a> increased stool frequency and reduced straining and soiling as compared with children treated with mineral oil alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. Furthermore, a large trial found that <em>Lactobacillus reuteri</em> given prophylactically to young infants helped to prevent the development of constipation during the first three months of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. However, negative results were reported in another randomized trial, in which 84 children were randomized to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lactulose</a> plus <em>Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG</em> or a lactulose-containing placebo for 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. There were no differences between the experimental and control groups in terms of spontaneous bowel movements or fecal soiling at 12 or 24 weeks of follow-up. Similarly, a trial in 94 preschool-aged children found no difference in defecation frequency for children receiving <em>Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus Lcr35</em> compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of chronic constipation requires monitoring by the clinician or clinician's staff to prevent recurrences. Planned follow-up is particularly important during the first few days of treatment, especially if disimpaction was warranted. The initial discussion can be by telephone, but the child may need to return to the office if he or she is still passing hard stools. Patients who require disimpaction also should have an office visit soon after completing the disimpaction protocol to review the details of maintenance therapy.</p><p>After entering the maintenance phase, the child should have regular follow-up visits, initially on a monthly basis and then less frequently (eg, every three to four months). The clinician should review the child's stool records (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62849%7EPEDS%2F53073\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62849 graphicRef53073 \">figure 2A-B</a>) and repeat the abdominal and rectal examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/16,106\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,106</a>].

Patients with ongoing chronic constipation despite adherence to an optimal medical and behavioral intervention should be evaluated by anorectal manometry <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> balloon expulsion testing. Colon transit studies using Sitzmarkers or radioisotopes can help evaluate oro-anal transit and colon manometry studies and identify regional or pancolonic dysmotility. Slow transit or regional and pancolonic dysmotility have been associated with chronic refractory symptoms. These tests can help identify patients with internal anal sphincter achalasia or other anatomic causes of constipation, or dyssynergic defecation, which is a functional disorder characterized by the incomplete evacuation of fecal material from the rectum due to paradoxical contraction or failure to relax pelvic floor muscles when straining to defecate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-infants-and-children-evaluation#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constipation in infants and children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Motility testing'</a>.)</p><p>Biofeedback therapy is occasionally added as an adjunct to medical and behavioral therapy for the subset of patients with dyssynergic defecation, but it requires a highly motivated patient and its efficacy in the pediatric age group is uncertain. For patients with dyssynergic defecation, biofeedback therapy teaches patients how to relax pelvic floor muscles when defecating, by converting measurements of anal pressure or electromyographic activity into a simple visual <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> auditory signal. Because biofeedback requires serial learning sessions with an anal probe and exercises, it is only practical for use in highly motivated older children and adolescents.

The effect of the botulinum toxin treatment is temporary (lasting up to several months). For patients that respond to initial treatments, additional injections may be given every few months, as needed, to maintain efficacy over the long term. Limited information is available to guide selection of patients for surgical approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Internal anal sphincter (IAS) achalasia &ndash; IAS achalasia is characterized by lack of rectoanal inhibitory reflex on anal manometry with a rectal biopsy that demonstrates the presence of ganglion cells, thus excluding Hirschsprung disease. The clinical presentation is similar to functional constipation. Patients typically do not respond to optimal and persistent medical and behavioral regimen, prompting further workup with anorectal manometry. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with IAS achalasia, both anal sphincter botulinum toxin or myectomy treatment are effective in 60 to 80 percent of patients. In a meta-analysis of studies comparing these treatments for IAS achalasia, patients undergoing myectomy reported more frequent bowel movements, and there were no significant differences in long-term laxative use between the two treatment modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. Interestingly, short term fecal incontinence was more common with botulinum toxin injection compared with myectomy. Thus, myectomy appears to be more effective than botulinum toxin for some patients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic constipation &ndash; Interestingly, patients without IAS achalasia (ie, no demonstrable abnormalities on anorectal manometry) also may respond to sphincter release.

All patients had normal findings on anorectal manometry, with no evidence of IAS achalasia. Botulinum toxin and myectomy and yielded improvement in symptom severity score in 80 and 55 percent of patients, respectively.

As an example, a follow-up evaluation of 97 patients treated in an encopresis clinic showed that 43 percent of a total of 97 patients (all of whom had been treated with milk of magnesia, a high-fiber diet, and bowel-training techniques) recovered by one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>].

In a retrospective review of children younger than two years of age who were treated for acute or chronic constipation in a general pediatric clinic, the following results were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>116 children were initially treated with dietary changes, corn syrup, or both.

Children with this disorder usually have full bowel movements in their clothing rather than just soiling. Treatment requires an approach similar to that described above but without laxative therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It is important to distinguish this disorder from constipation-associated fecal incontinence, which is far more common (in 80 percent of children, fecal incontinence is associated with constipation). Children with fecal incontinence should have a careful evaluation for underlying constipation, including a digital rectal examination, because constipation is not always recognized by the child or caregiver. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional fecal incontinence in infants and children: Definition, clinical manifestations and evaluation&quot;</a>.) </p><p>No widely effective treatments have been established for non-retentive fecal incontinence, but most approaches focus on behavior modification and psychosocial diagnosis and support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The behavioral protocol generally includes a highly structured toilet training protocol designed to encourage frequent and sustained efforts at defecation and supported by behavior modification techniques including a reward system. Laxatives, enemas, and biofeedback are not helpful in these children (provided that constipation has been carefully excluded) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment/abstract/112,133,134\" class=\"abstract_t\">112,133,134</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Laxatives'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest use of polyethylene glycol (PEG), as the initial choice for maintenance therapy rather than other laxatives (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
