Fortunately, pruritus is not among the most common symptoms in the palliative care population, and when present, it may be short lived and go unreported. However, in a minority of patients, pruritus may be severe or persistent, which may result in significant distress and poor quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-pruritus-and-sweating/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1749534574\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification and pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The International Forum for the Study of Itch (IFSI) proposes a two-tier classification system for pruritus based on whether the etiology is known or not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-pruritus-and-sweating/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. When the etiology is known, pruritus is divided into dermatological, systemic, neurologic, psychogenic, and mixed categories. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pruritus-etiology-and-patient-evaluation#H690774\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pruritus: Etiology and patient evaluation&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>.)</p><p>Depending on the duration of symptoms, pruritus can be classified as acute (duration less than six weeks) or chronic (longer than six weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-pruritus-and-sweating/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Chronic pruritus may become difficult to control, and the lack of effective treatments results from a still incomplete knowledge of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.</p><p>Although the neurologic pathways that lead to itch are not fully understood, it is generally accepted that transmission of signals along unmyelinated, histamine-sensitive, and non-histamine-sensitive peripheral C nerve fibers (distinct from the C nerve fibers that transmit pain) is involved. These fibers represent a minority (up to 5 percent) of C nerve fibers in the body and are characterized by a slow conduction velocity and extensive terminal branching. Histamine-sensitive fibers have an important role in the transmission of acute itch and itch in urticaria, while non-histamine nerve fibers have a significant role in itch transmission of most types of chronic itch, possibly accounting for the poor response of many types of chronic itch to oral antihistamines.</p><p>Both scratching and rubbing skin inhibit the sensation of pruritus by stimulating inhibitory local circuits in the spinal cord and brain; scratching also stimulates pain receptors, which inhibits the sensation of itch. The inhibitory interneurons can be activated by both peripheral and central stimuli, and they release endogenous opiates. Additionally, central sensitization for itching may occur in patients with chronic pruritus such that noxious stimuli are perceived as itch rather than pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pruritus-etiology-and-patient-evaluation#H690767\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pruritus: Etiology and patient evaluation&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2531436888\"><span class=\"h2\">Common etiologies in palliative care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The palliative care population includes a diverse group of patients with disparate advanced diseases; as such, the overall prevalence of significant pruritus in this population has not been well studied. The following data are available:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study of advanced cancer patients receiving home palliative care, pruritus was reported in 3.6 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-pruritus-and-sweating/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On the other hand, pruritus may be more common among hospitalized patients. A review of dermatologic disease in 271 patients admitted to an inpatient palliative care unit (86 percent with cancer) found a high frequency of both xerosis (dry skin; 78 percent) and pruritus (35 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-pruritus-and-sweating/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p>As will be discussed in the sections below, the prevalence of pruritus varies depending on the primary etiology of pruritus. The highest prevalence has been reported in patients receiving spinal opioids (up to 100 percent), such as in the postoperative setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adverse-effects-of-neuraxial-analgesia-and-anesthesia-for-obstetrics#H1940945420\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adverse effects of neuraxial analgesia and anesthesia for obstetrics&quot;, section on 'Pruritus'</a>.)</p><p>From an etiologic standpoint, the main causes of pruritus in the palliative care population are chronic renal failure, liver disease, hematologic or lymphoproliferative disorders, malignancy, and drugs (especially opioids) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F114576\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114576 \">table 1</a>). Dry skin is frequently present in older adults and can accompany and exacerbate all causes of pruritus. In the terminally ill, multiple etiologies along with rapidly evolving organ dysfunctions may not always allow a singular diagnosis to be made.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4118306178\"><span class=\"h3\">Uremic pruritus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pruritus is a frequent and distressing symptom in patients with advanced and end-stage renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-pruritus-and-sweating/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Pruritus is mainly associated with chronic rather than acute renal failure, occurring more frequently in patients who are on maintenance dialysis. Pruritus is not a feature of acute renal failure. Prevalence studies conducted in adult hemodialysis patients in the past several decades suggest an overall decline in the incidence of pruritus associated with more effective dialysis. Whereas the reported prevalence between 1980 and 1993 was 50 to 90 percent, subsequent surveys note a lower rate (22 to 57 percent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uremic-pruritus#H98332764\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uremic pruritus&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Among palliative care patients, chronic renal failure may also occur as a result of a primary kidney disorder or secondary to complications of another advanced illness, typically heart failure.</p><p>The pathogenesis of uremic pruritus is multifactorial and includes skin atrophy and dryness secondary hyperparathyroidism, accumulation of pruritogenic metabolites, and abnormal mast cell proliferation in skin. Dry skin is present in 66 to 93 percent of patients with uremic pruritus. Pruritus accompanying renal failure is usually generalized, may be intermittent or continuous, and is exacerbated by the presence of dry skin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uremic-pruritus#H14965810\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uremic pruritus&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H270514871\"><span class=\"h3\">Cholestasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among palliative care populations, the most common cholestatic liver disorders, characterized by diminished delivery of bile into the intestine, are malignancy related. Tumors may produce extrahepatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intrahepatic biliary obstruction, including liver tumors (primary or metastatic), gallbladder cancers, or tumors obstructing the common bile ducts (eg, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, pancreatic cancer). Approximately 45 percent of patients with malignant biliary obstruction report pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-pruritus-and-sweating/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A presumptive diagnosis of cholestasis-associated pruritus can be made in a patient with cholestasis who complains of itching. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis#H71722299\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pruritus associated with cholestasis&quot;, section on 'Associated conditions'</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of pruritus in cholestasis in unknown, but both peripheral and central mechanisms appear to be involved. Several hypotheses have been proposed, including bile acid accumulation, increased opioidergic tone, and elevations in lysophosphatidic acid levels. While bile acids are potential mediators of pruritus, no direct correlation has been demonstrated between pruritus and the severity of the underlying liver disease or circulating bile acid levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pruritus associated with cholestasis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1780373515\"><span class=\"h3\">Malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pruritus may accompany a malignant condition in the absence of cholestasis. The prevalence of pruritus is higher in hematologic malignancies than in solid tumors. The most common hematologic and nonhematologic malignant disorders associated with pruritus include Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, polycythemia vera, mycosis fungoides, the leukemias, and histamine-producing gastric carcinoid tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pruritus-etiology-and-patient-evaluation#H690886\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pruritus: Etiology and patient evaluation&quot;, section on 'Malignancy'</a>.)</p><p>Pruritus related to malignancy may represent a paraneoplastic syndrome, or less commonly, it may be secondary to a compressive effect of the tumor, such as with a tumor nerve entrapment syndrome (eg, spinal tumors causing brachioradial pruritus). Pruritus may also represent an effect of cutaneous metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-pruritus-and-sweating/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] or lymphocytic infiltration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pruritus-etiology-and-patient-evaluation#H690928\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pruritus: Etiology and patient evaluation&quot;, section on 'Brachioradial pruritus'</a>.)</p><p>The Special Interest Group (SIG) of the IFSI defines paraneoplastic pruritus as &ldquo;a systemic (not local) reaction to the presence of a solid tumor or a hematological malignancy neither induced by the local presence of cancer cells nor by tumor therapy&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-pruritus-and-sweating/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In this setting, pruritus is usually generalized, may precede the diagnosis of the malignancy by months to years, and tends to increase in severity with advanced stages of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-pruritus-and-sweating/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Several hematologic disorders, such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and leukemia, are associated with pruritus, which may be associated with cutaneous disease infiltration, a paraneoplastic process, or both. Pruritus is one of the hallmarks of the most common types of CTCL, mycosis fungoides and its leukemic variant S&eacute;zary syndrome, with the prevalence and severity increasing in advanced stages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-pruritus-and-sweating/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Generalized pruritus is present in over 80 percent of patients with S&eacute;zary syndrome, in approximately 50 percent with polycythemia vera, in 30 percent with Hodgkin lymphoma, in 10 percent with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and in 5 percent with leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-pruritus-and-sweating/abstract/9,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13,14</a>]. With advancing disease, pruritus is often severe, diffuse, and accompanied by a burning sensation similar to neuropathic pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mycosis-fungoides#H17265505\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of mycosis fungoides&quot;, section on 'Pruritus'</a>.)</p><p>On the other hand, polycythemia vera pruritus is often triggered immediately following contact with water (&ldquo;aquagenic pruritus&rdquo;) and occurs without observable skin lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-pruritus-and-sweating/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polycythemia-vera#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polycythemia vera&quot;, section on 'Pruritus'</a>.)</p><p>The pathophysiology of paraneoplastic pruritus is not well understood, but it appears to involve an immunologic reaction to tumor-specific antigens. Several data suggest that high and unbalanced production of cytokines results in histamine-independent itching. More recent studies suggest a role of interleukin (IL)-31 as an important mediator of pruritus in CTCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-pruritus-and-sweating/abstract/16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18</a>]. In subjects with polycythemia vera, aquagenic pruritus has been shown to be associated with increased skin infiltration and mast cell degranulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-pruritus-and-sweating/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and it is more pronounced in patients showing the <em>JAK2</em> 617V mutation.

Cutaneous metastases, particularly breast cancer, may occasionally present with rash, pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-pruritus-and-sweating/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Pruritus in cancer patients may also be due to cancer treatments, such as molecularly targeted therapies (eg, epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, BRAF inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors), and opioids, which are frequently prescribed for pain management in cancer patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87630\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87630 \">table 2</a>).

HIV patients with peripheral neuropathy may also complain of localized pruritus.</p><p>A small subset of HIV patients have severe refractory pruritus, often associated with recurrent crops of discrete, erythematous, urticarial follicular papules and rare pustules with hypereosinophilia, thought to be due to hyperactivation of humoral immunity and characterized by a higher HIV viral load than in patients without this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-pruritus-and-sweating/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Only a minority continue to have persistent severe and refractory pain despite systemically administered opioids and are considered for spinal or neuraxial opioid therapy (such as the epidural and intrathecal routes). In contrast, neuraxial opioids are used more frequently for postoperative pain.

The highest prevalence (up to 100 percent) has been reported with intrathecal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> administration. In general, the use of smaller opioid doses and the addition of local anesthetics decrease both the prevalence and the severity of pruritus.

In the former, sweating may disappear with progression of neuropathy secondary to nerve damage. In CRPS, pain is usually severe and predominant, and it can be debilitating. Post-stroke unilateral hyperhidrosis has been observed following lesions to the cerebrum, hypothalamus and midbrain, and spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-pruritus-and-sweating/abstract/85-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">85-95</a>], which is partly due to the disruption of inhibitory neural signals that regulate sweating contralateral to the lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2008860116\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial assessment should include a detailed history, medication review, symptom assessment, and physical examination, which all help reveal the location and severity of hyperhidrosis and provide clues to the possible underlying etiology. Specific symptoms that should be sought include pain, weight loss, anxiety, jitteriness, flushing, sleep disruption, signs and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy, and fever and other <span class=\"nowrap\">symptoms/signs</span> suggestive of infection.</p><p>The severity of hyperhidrosis may be assessed by the impact on functioning, social interactions, sleep, and the need to change clothes and bed linens. A number of objective hyperhidrosis assessment scales [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-pruritus-and-sweating/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>] are available and are mainly used for focal hyperhidrosis; they are generally inappropriate in the palliative care setting.</p><p>Further diagnostic workup (ie, cultures, diagnostic radiographic imaging, laboratory evaluation), especially if fever is found, depends on the clinical context and goals of care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3101826465\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment for hyperhidrosis can be challenging for both the patient and the clinician. The first steps in management should involve treatment of the underlying etiology, if clinically appropriate, such as treatment of infections as well as elimination of any potential aggravating factors (eg, hyperthyroidism). If a patient is taking a medication known to cause flushing or excessive sweating, the medication should be withdrawn, if possible, as a diagnostic trial (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56351\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56351 \">table 6</a>). If this is not possible, changing to a lower dose, an extended-release formulation of the medication, or a drug less likely to cause sweating is another potential strategy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3084626717\"><span class=\"h3\">General measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nondrug treatment approaches to symptom management include use of fans to keep the skin cool, wearing loose cotton clothing, use of cotton bed linens, and maintaining adequate hydration, along with emotional support and reassurance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3679444848\"><span class=\"h3\">Febrile patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If infection is suspected and the goals of care are not consistent with a formal diagnostic workup, an empiric course of antibiotics is reasonable. </p><p>If tumor-associated fever is suspected, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are initially used.

When the etiology is known, pruritus is divided into dermatological, systemic, neurologic, psychogenic, and mixed categories. (See <a href=\"#H1749534574\" class=\"local\">'Classification and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main causes of pruritus in the palliative care population are chronic renal failure, liver disease, hematologic or lymphoproliferative disorders, malignancy, and drugs (especially opioids) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F114576\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114576 \">table 1</a>). Xerosis (dry skin) is frequently present in older adults and can accompany and exacerbate all causes of pruritus. In the terminally ill, multiple etiologies along with rapidly evolving organ dysfunctions may not always allow a singular diagnosis to be made. (See <a href=\"#H2531436888\" class=\"local\">'Common etiologies in palliative care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, treatment involves an individualized stepwise approach that depends upon the severity of symptoms, the patient&rsquo;s clinical circumstances and goals of care, and the response to initial therapies. Although systematic evaluation and treatment directed at eradicating the primary cause of the pruritus may be recommended (eg, stenting for biliary obstruction), this is not a feasible option for the vast majority of palliative care patients, and for most patients, therapy is generally directed at reducing itch regardless of etiology. (See <a href=\"#H1627427591\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General skin care measures are recommended for all patients, regardless of the cause of the pruritus. Dry skin can accompany and exacerbate all causes of pruritus; therefore, measures to regularly lubricate the skin with non-fragrant topical emollients, especially after bathing, are important. (See <a href=\"#H639465234\" class=\"local\">'Skin care measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topical therapies are generally preferred due to a lower propensity for side effects, especially when pruritus is mild, intermittent, or localized. Systemic drugs may be recommended for persistent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> generalized pruritus, or when topical therapies are not effective for localized pruritus. Unfortunately, most of the pharmacologic treatments are based upon small uncontrolled studies and case reports, and there is little high-quality evidence to guide best practice. If therapy is initiated, ongoing evaluation of the benefit versus the burden and side effects of the ongoing treatment is needed. (See <a href=\"#H2850434735\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacological treatments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Histamine release does not play a meaningful role in the pruritus typically observed in palliative patients; therefore, oral antihistamines are not usually beneficial. (See <a href=\"#H3236560564\" class=\"local\">'Systemic drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with malignant extrahepatic biliary obstruction, bile duct stenting is reasonable in the setting of biliary obstruction if it is consistent with the goals of care. For patients with moderate to severe pruritus symptoms, we suggest bile acid sequestrants or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Other therapies that could be considered for refractory cases are opioid antagonists, glucocorticoids, or antidepressants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a>. The effect should happen within hours if the drug will work. If it does not, switch. (See <a href=\"#H3206508498\" class=\"local\">'Cholestasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For treatment of uremic pruritus that is refractory to optimized dialysis; to correction of hyperparathyroidism, hyperphosphatemia, and hypermagnesemia; to topical treatments; and to general skin care measures, we suggest oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, in our view, gabapentin use in uremic patients not on dialysis should be avoided due to neurotoxicity concerns. Other options include oral antihistamines or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a>. (See <a href=\"#H285079361\" class=\"local\">'Uremia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Treatment of opioid-induced pruritus (OIP) is challenging. Due to the high prevalence of pruritus with spinal opioids, simultaneous prophylactic therapy is a reasonable approach for most patients. For patients with OIP who are receiving systemic opioids, oral antihistamines (for patients receiving systemic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>) and switching to an alternative opioid are the preferred approaches. (See <a href=\"#H2050021101\" class=\"local\">'Opioid-induced pruritus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with malignant skin infiltrations, hematologic diseases associated with pruritus, and paraneoplastic pruritus, a number of diverse groups of drugs, such as H1 antihistamines, corticosteroids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, opioid antagonists, and neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonists, have been used to control pruritus. There are no comparative trials, and the choice of initial therapy is empiric. (See <a href=\"#H2883433053\" class=\"local\">'Hematologic diseases, tumor infiltration, paraneoplastic pruritus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with pruritus of an unknown cause, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If effective, all of these drugs tend to work quickly. For most patients with pruritus, we would usually start with one drug class, and if there is no relief within a day, we would move on to a different class.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For refractory cases, phototherapy using ultraviolet B light is most useful in pruritus associated with uremia, but it may also benefit pruritus associated with cholestasis and malignant skin infiltrations. The treatment sessions are usually three times per week, and this may not be practical in terminally ill patients, depending on the clinical circumstances and goals of care. (See <a href=\"#H2586949948\" class=\"local\">'Phototherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H54365265\"><span class=\"h2\">Sweating</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary hyperhidrosis can accompany a variety of conditions, including endocrine, metabolic, neurologic, or psychiatric disorders; tumors; febrile illnesses (including infection); or medication use.
