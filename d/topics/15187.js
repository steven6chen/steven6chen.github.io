In others cases, systemic therapy may be useful in men when comorbidity or advanced age precludes aggressive local salvage therapy.</p><p>The role of systemic therapy in men with a PSA recurrence without evidence of disseminated disease will be reviewed here. The management of patients with disseminated prostate cancer is discussed separately.

In this situation, increases in serum PSA over the baseline after initial treatment are not accompanied by symptoms or signs of locally recurrent or metastatic disease. Imaging should be considered to evaluate for metastasis, especially in cases with initial high-risk disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> short PSA doubling time. Many of these men are relatively young and otherwise healthy. For men in whom there is a significant likelihood that disease is confined to the prostate gland, salvage therapy may result in prolonged disease-free survival.</p><p>Serum PSA is also monitored after salvage therapy for a biochemical recurrence. Either nonresponse to salvage therapy or a response followed by another biochemical recurrence is frequent after salvage therapy.</p><p>Although most patients who have a rising serum PSA following definitive therapy (radiation therapy [RT] or radical prostatectomy) will not have evidence of disseminated disease, careful evaluation is required to rule out the possibility of distant metastases prior to salvage therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a confirmed rise in serum PSA following prior RT, biopsy of the prostate bed is indicated to confirm the presence of residual or recurrent prostate cancer.

However, in this situation, the possibility that the rising serum PSA is due to benign prostatic hyperplasia or retained normal prostate should be considered, and a three to six month period of surveillance or trial of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor should be considered prior to committing to salvage therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3394841766\" class=\"local\">'5-alpha reductase inhibitors'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For men who have had a radical prostatectomy and a confirmed serum PSA &ge;0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> salvage RT, often combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), is the primary treatment option. However, systemic therapy (ADT) is an alternative for those who are not candidates for or refuse salvage RT.

However, not all men with rising PSA after salvage therapy need immediate treatment. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Androgen deprivation therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2712605811\" class=\"local\">'ADT plus chemotherapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'When to initiate ADT-based therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For men who are candidates for systemic therapy for an elevated serum PSA following initial definitive therapy, ADT is the current standard of care. However, some contemporary data suggest that adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> chemotherapy or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abiraterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abiraterone</a> acetate plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> to ADT may improve outcomes in high-risk, good performance status patients, and this information should be discussed with the patient. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Androgen deprivation therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2712605811\" class=\"local\">'ADT plus chemotherapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H72176503\" class=\"local\">'ADT plus abiraterone'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANDROGEN DEPRIVATION THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If salvage therapy is not appropriate, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) represents the standard of care for most men with a rising serum PSA and no evidence of disseminated disease following definitive treatment. Combining ADT with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abiraterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abiraterone</a> has shown significantly improved survival in patients with metastatic or high-risk localized disease, but there are only limited data on the efficacy of these approaches in patients with a rising PSA as the only evidence of advanced disease. (See <a href=\"#H223802429\" class=\"local\">'Combined modality approaches incorporating ADT'</a> below.) </p><p>For men with metastatic prostate cancer, ADT with either a gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist, or with orchiectomy, either alone or in conjunction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> chemotherapy, is the standard initial treatment. This approach effectively palliates symptoms in 80 to 90 percent of men, and may delay disease progression and prolong survival. Such treatment, while beneficial, is not curative. The majority of men progress to castration resistance within two to five years and require additional therapy, and most eventually die from prostate cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial systemic therapy for castration-sensitive prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In men with a PSA-only recurrence after initial treatment, overt metastatic disease may not become evident for many years. No adequate data from randomized trials have compared the role of ADT with observation in this setting, and it is unclear how applicable the data from men with more advanced disease is to this group. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Definition, natural history, and risk stratification&quot;, section on 'Risk of metastases or death'</a>.)</p><p>ADT causes side effects that can significantly lower the quality of life. These adverse effects are particularly important in otherwise asymptomatic men whose only manifestation of disease is a rising serum PSA. The potential development of hot flashes, fatigue, loss of libido, decreased muscle mass, mild anemia, cognitive changes, and osteoporosis is a significant concern and needs to be considered in deciding when to initiate ADT. Furthermore, concerns about ADT-induced weight gain and an increased risk for diabetes mellitus, cardiac disease, and metabolic syndrome add credence to the use of a risk-stratified approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=side-effects-of-androgen-deprivation-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Side effects of androgen deprivation therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Key questions concerning the use of ADT include whether treatment should be initiated as soon as a rising PSA is detected or can be delayed, and whether initial treatment with ADT should use monotherapy (eg, a GnRH agonist, GnRH antagonist, orchiectomy), combined androgen blockade (CAB; a GnRH agonist or orchiectomy plus an antiandrogen), ADT in combination with chemotherapy or in combination with a second-generation androgen signaling inhibitor (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abiraterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abiraterone</a> acetate plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>), or an alternative approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">When to initiate ADT-based therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal timing of ADT for men with a PSA-only recurrence is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-after-treatment-for-localized-prostate-cancer-systemic-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Our approach is to initiate ADT early rather than late in younger men with high-grade disease (eg, Gleason score 8 to 10) and a serum PSA doubling time of &lt;10 to 12 months. There is no consensus on what is &quot;early&quot; initiation of ADT, but a practical target is PSA &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (or perhaps &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> for older men). </p><p>Proponents of early treatment argue that this approach can delay disease progression and may prolong survival. Others contend that treatment is best deferred until clinical metastases or symptoms develop since there is no consistent evidence for a significant survival benefit with ADT in this setting, and treatment is associated with adverse effects. In randomized trials in patients with advanced prostate cancer, early initiation of therapy has been associated with a decrease in prostate cancer mortality but no improvement in overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-after-treatment-for-localized-prostate-cancer-systemic-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Salvage ADT was given to 44 percent of patients. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival or prostate cancer-specific survival for those given immediate salvage ADT.

However, the optimal timing of ADT is controversial. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Androgen deprivation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest early, rather than delayed, therapy in younger men who are at risk for early metastasis, that is men with high-grade disease (eg, Gleason score 8 to 10) and a serum PSA doubling time of &lt;10-12 months (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For men with favorable features, such as PSA doubling time &gt;12 months, initiation of ADT can be delayed, with careful informed consent and periodic imaging to assess for metastatic disease. There is no consensus on what is &quot;early&quot; initiation of ADT, but a practical target is PSA &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>.

In a large prospective trial, intermittent androgen deprivation (IAD) was noninferior to continuous therapy and can be considered with the caveats discussed above. If one of these approaches is used, patients must be fully counseled that there are limited data to support a benefit for these therapies.
