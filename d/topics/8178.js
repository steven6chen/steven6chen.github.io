Amplification or overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) oncogene is present in approximately 15 percent of primary invasive breast cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/her2-and-predicting-response-to-therapy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Women with both early-stage and metastatic breast cancer that meet criteria for HER2 positivity are treated with regimens including HER2-directed therapy. </p><p>Here we will review the definition of HER2 positivity, and the approach to HER2 discordance.

The HER2 receptor belongs to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptors, which are critical in the activation of subcellular signal transduction pathways controlling epithelial cell growth and differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/her2-and-predicting-response-to-therapy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>] and possibly angiogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/her2-and-predicting-response-to-therapy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

High levels of HER2 expression identify those women who benefit from treatment with agents that target HER2. </p><p>HER2 overexpression was associated with high rates of disease recurrence and death in the absence of adjuvant systemic therapy. However, the value of this prognostic information in clinical practice is questionable, particularly with the earlier use of HER2-directed agents in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting. </p><p>For women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, HER2 gene expression is an important component of the 21-gene recurrence score assay.

The assays used clinically are below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overexpression of the HER2 protein product &ndash; Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or immunohistochemistry (IHC).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HER2 gene amplification by in situ hybridization (ISH) &ndash; Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH), silver-enhanced in situ hybridization (SISH), or differential polymerase chain reaction (PCR).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3657637196\"><span class=\"h2\">IHC and ISH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients who test positive for HER2 should receive HER2-directed therapy. The only HER2 test results that are known to predict benefit from anti-HER2 therapy are IHC 3+ score or FISH &gt;2 ratio. The other &quot;equivocal&quot; findings on FISH (eg, single copy &gt;6, etc.) are of unknown value in predicting benefit from therapy.</p><p>We agree with the American Society of Clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">Oncology/College</span> of American Pathologists <span class=\"nowrap\">(ASCO/CAP)</span> guidelines for HER2 testing, which are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F75536\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75536 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/her2-and-predicting-response-to-therapy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Recommended algorithms for IHC and FISH testing of breast tumors are provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64757\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef64757 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72767\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72767 \">algorithm 2</a>).
