Clinical staging is usually accomplished by performing a physical examination, colonoscopy (if possible), and an imaging evaluation (eg, transrectal endoscopic ultrasound, computed tomography scanning, or magnetic resonance imaging). The accuracy and comparative performance of these imaging modalities for staging is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretreatment local staging evaluation for rectal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will discuss the technique and application of endoscopic ultrasound for patients with rectal cancer.

However, optimal tumor visualization may require repositioning the patient to place the region of interest in the dependent portion of the rectum. This is particularly important when assessing the primary tumor (T) stage of early superficial lesions because the rectum is filled with water, and minimal compression by the balloon is desired to achieve acoustic coupling.</p><p>A radial scanning echoendoscope is inserted approximately 30 cm to assess for iliac adenopathy. The wall and periluminal structures are carefully inspected while slowly withdrawing the echoendoscope. If necessary, the linear scanning echoendoscope is also inserted for fine-needle aspiration (FNA) sampling of suspicious extramural lesions <span class=\"nowrap\">(mass/adenopathy)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59895\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59895 \">image 1</a>). The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines regarding endoscopic prophylaxis for gastrointestinal procedures do not make a recommendation with regard to antibiotic prophylaxis for EUS-FNA of solid lesions in the lower gastrointestinal tract. Our practice is to give prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> prior to the FNA (500 mg orally 30 to 60 minutes prior to the procedure or 400 mg IV 30 minutes prior). Oral ciprofloxacin (250 to 500 mg twice daily) is then given for 48 hours after the procedure. However, not all endoscopists routinely use antibiotics in this setting. Moderate (conscious) sedation is not mandatory, but may be helpful when EUS-guided FNA is performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antibiotic prophylaxis for gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although rectal ultrasound can be performed with rigid instruments, our preference is to use the flexible fiberoptic echoendoscope to facilitate traversal of stenotic tumors and permit assessment of lymph nodes in the left iliac region. The major limitations of rigid instruments are their restricted ability to image and perform FNA in the proximal rectum and evaluate for lymphadenopathy in the region of the left iliac vessels. Whether this impacts adversely on staging accuracy remains to be seen, and a prospective, randomized trial would be required to answer this question. The rigid probes are substantially less expensive than the flexible dedicated echoendoscopes (approximately one-third the cost); however, they do not have the spectrum of capabilities (imaging of the upper intestinal tract and performance of FNA).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1067157148\"><span class=\"h2\">T stage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tumor (T) stage of a rectal cancer is determined by the depth of invasion of the primary tumor, including involvement of adjacent anatomic structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>). TEUS offers superior spatial resolution compared with standard CT and MRI techniques, which can provide more refined assessments of depth of invasion for T staging. This superior resolution is particularly useful in distinguishing T2 from early T3 tumors, which can be indistinguishable on MRI. </p><p>The sensitivity and specificity of TEUS for staging rectal cancer was addressed in a compilation of data from seven systematic reviews (2009 or later) from the Agency for Healthcare and Research Quality (AHRQ) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The performance characteristics of TEUS and comparison of imaging modalities for determining T stage are discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F116635\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116635 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretreatment local staging evaluation for rectal cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">N stage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nodal (N) stage of rectal cancer is determined by the number of regional lymph nodes that are involved by cancer and by the presence of isolated, non-nodal, perirectal tumor deposits (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>). Comparison of imaging modalities for determining the N stage of rectal cancer is discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F116636\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116636 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretreatment local staging evaluation for rectal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Fine-needle aspiration biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of peri-rectal lymph nodes only in patients who appear to have early T stage disease but who also have evident peri-iliac lymphadenopathy, and in patients suspected of having recurrent disease. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent rectal cancer'</a> below.)</p><p>EUS-guided FNA does not appear to improve the staging of rectal cancer for some patients. This was underscored in our series in which we attempted to define the role of TEUS-guided FNA of perirectal lymph nodes in the preoperative assessment of a cohort of 80 patients with newly diagnosed, nonmetastatic rectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The overall accuracy of N staging was similar (about 80 percent) for CT, TEUS, and TEUS-FNA. One reason why FNA may not add significantly to TEUS alone is that perirectal lymph nodes are typically too small to be visualized by TEUS unless they contain metastatic disease. Thus, biopsy would not be expected to improve sensitivity when compared with visual criteria alone (eg, size, homogeneity, contour). This is in contrast to the demonstrated benefit of TEUS-guided FNA that has been observed when evaluating regional lymph nodes in other parts of the digestive tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer/abstract/3-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-11</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-fine-needle-aspiration-biopsy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy in the gastrointestinal tract&quot;</a>). </p><p>However, different conclusions were reached in another study which showed that incorporation of EUS-FNA into the pretreatment evaluation of patients with rectal cancer resulted in accurate staging and improved patient outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In this study comparing patients with rectal cancer who underwent staging with EUS-FNA with a similarly matched patient group who did not found that EUS-FNA was associated with reduced tumor recurrence risk (hazard ratio, 0.72, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.97). EUS-FNA likely achieved this effect through accurate staging, which facilitated optimal selection of patients with locally advanced disease who benefited maximally from preoperative neoadjuvant therapy. </p><p>With the emergence of testing for gene mutations in FNA nodal samples, this technology has been applied to rectal cancer. In a cohort of 102 patients with malignant perirectal nodes, 89 percent had pathogenic alterations in known cancer-associated genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This area of research holds potential for predicting patients&rsquo; responses to treatment as the identification of mutations in <em>DRAS, NRAS, </em>or<em> BRAF</em> would suggest that these patients would be refractory to treatment with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1067157171\"><span class=\"h2\">Circumferential resection margin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with anterior tumors, EUS can assess the extent of tumor involvement of the mesorectal fascia (MRF, the lateral margin) by predicting the distance of the tumor to the circumferential resection plane after rectal cancer surgery, called the circumferential resection margin (CRM). For posterior or posterolateral tumors, the distance to the CRM cannot be estimated using EUS because neighboring structures that allow assessment of the CRM are lacking. In such cases, the distance to the CRM can be estimated using MRI. </p><p>The distance from the tumor to the CRM has important prognostic implications and may influence which patients are offered neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. A &quot;positive&quot; CRM, defined variably as a tumor that invades or is in close proximity to the MRF, is the most important risk factor for local recurrence after rectal cancer surgery. If the MRF is involved or if the tumor extends to a point that is within 1 to 2 mm of the MRF, there is a clear risk that the CRM will be involved if only a total mesorectal excision is performed. As a result, these patients are usually approached with initial chemoradiotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Indications for neoadjuvant treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretreatment local staging evaluation for rectal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One study examined 152 patients whose preoperative staging suggested either a lymph node-positive T2 tumor or a T3 tumor regardless of lymph node involvement; no patient received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The estimated CRM was determined using EUS alone (49 percent of patients), EUS plus MRI (41 percent), or MRI alone (10 percent of patients). The CRM was considered &quot;threatened&quot; if the tumor was within 2 mm, and &quot;non-threatened&quot; if it was more than 2 mm from the CRM based upon EUS <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> MRI. If the preoperative staging categorized the CRM as potentially free, then the histologic margin was clear in 92 percent of cases. If the CRM was not assessed or was defined as threatened, it was involved in 33 and 44 percent of patients, respectively. Upon histologic review of the resected specimen, the distance from the tumor to the CRM was an important predictor of local recurrence, disease-free survival, and cancer-specific survival on multivariable analysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer#H623938\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretreatment local staging evaluation for rectal cancer&quot;, section on 'TRUS versus MRI'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">LEARNING CURVE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A general concern related to EUS is whether the published results (derived from centers with the most experience with EUS) can be generalized since a learning curve has been widely recognized. Although a learning curve clearly exists in mastering this transrectal EUS, the technique is relatively straightforward compared to EUS in other areas (particularly the pancreas and mediastinum). These points were illustrated in a report in which staging accuracy improved from 58 percent for the initial 12 studies to 88 percent for the remaining 24 examinations (a rapid rate of improvement) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">RECURRENT RECTAL CANCER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local recurrences often develop extraluminally, making early detection difficult during standard endoscopic follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surveillance after colorectal cancer resection&quot;</a>). </p><p>In this setting, computed tomography (CT) scanning may not be capable of distinguishing recurrence from postoperative change due to fibrosis or inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Furthermore, images can be obscured by artifacts from surgically placed metal clips. Transrectal EUS (TEUS) combines the diagnostic potential of video endoscopy (endoluminal tumor detection) with CT (extramural tumor detection) and has proven to be a sensitive and specific method for detecting local recurrence. However, its performance is somewhat diminished in the posttreatment setting because of postoperative or post-radiation inflammatory soft tissue changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>]. These changes obscure the mucosal layers of the rectum, making ultrasonographic images difficult to interpret.</p><p>A meta-analysis of 46 studies that included 2224 patients compared the ability of EUS, CT, and MRI to accurately predict the response of locally advanced rectal cancer following administration of preoperative neoadjuvant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The pooled accuracy of EUS to assess complete tumor response for EUS, MRI, and CT were 82, 75 and 83 percent, respectively. The accuracy for detection of lymph node metastases for EUS, MRI, and CT were 72, 72, and 65 percent, respectively. These results confirm the limitations of EUS in precisely discerning T stage following receipt of radiation treatment.</p><p>Despite these limitations, at least two prospective studies have demonstrated superior performance characteristics of TEUS when compared with pelvic CT for detection of local recurrence of rectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer/abstract/18,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,24</a>]. The sensitivity of TEUS for detecting recurrence was higher (100 percent) in both studies compared with CT (82 to 85 percent). However, a major limitation of EUS in this setting is a loss of specificity due to misinterpretation of mucosal inflammation as recurrent tumor (89 versus 93 percent for CT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. On the other hand, unlike CT, EUS-FNA permits histological confirmation of tumor recurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Fine-needle aspiration biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to initial staging, the accuracy of TEUS for recurrent disease may be improved with the addition of FNA. In a study of 312 patients, for example, FNA significantly improved accuracy compared with TEUS alone (92 versus 75 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The superior accuracy was primarily reflected in better specificity (93 versus 57 percent for CT).</p><p>Similar conclusions were reached in another series of 116 patients with biopsy-proven tumor recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Accuracy for detection of recurrence was 79 percent with TEUS alone, but rose to 100 percent when TEUS-guided FNA was used to differentiate between malignant and benign pararectal lesions. The biggest advantage of TEUS-FNA in this population was the ability to detect very small pararectal recurrences (the smallest tumor being 3 mm), allowing for potentially curative resection. Thirty-one of 116 patients (27 percent) with local recurrence detected by TEUS-FNA were suitable candidates for reexploration, of whom only 25 would have been identified by EUS alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up after resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although TEUS, and particularly TEUS-FNA, offers a benefit compared with conventional radiographic studies in detecting local recurrence, there is no consensus as to the optimal frequency or timing of follow-up study in these patients. Performing a baseline posttreatment TEUS three months following surgery may reduce the limitation of misinterpreting postoperative changes since by this time, most treatment-related changes have stabilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In the study mentioned above, TEUS was performed at three-month intervals until two years and subsequently at six-month intervals until three years postsurgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Similarly, there is no general agreement as to which patients should be selected for close follow-up with TEUS. A reasonable approach would be to perform the most aggressive surveillance in patients who had locally advanced tumors and those in whom local (ie, transanal) excision was performed since such patients have the highest risk of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].
