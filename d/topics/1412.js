The assessment and management of auricle (ear) lacerations is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-management-of-auricle-ear-lacerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and management of auricle (ear) lacerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1845349519\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Auricular hematoma describes a collection of blood within the cartilaginous auricle (outer ear) which typically results from blunt trauma during sports (eg, amateur wrestling, rugby, boxing, or mixed martial arts). This injury warrants prompt drainage and measures to prevent reaccumulation of blood. </p><p>Cauliflower ear is the permanent deformity caused by fibrocartilage overgrowth that occurs when an auricular hematoma is not fully drained, recurs, or is left untreated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F87691\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87691 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3540807\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The uniquely protuberant nature of the external ear makes it particularly susceptible to trauma. The cartilaginous subunits of the pinna include the helix, the antihelix, the concha, tragus, and antitragus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57847\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57847 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-auricular-hematoma-and-cauliflower-ear/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The lobule, or ear lobe, is composed of fibroadipose tissue and lacks cartilage. The skin overlying the cartilaginous auricle, or pinna, is thin, without significant subcutaneous adipose tissue, and is densely adherent to the underlying perichondrium. The perichondrium, in turn, supplies nutrients to the auricular cartilage.</p><p>When traumatic hematoma occurs, the blood accumulates within the subperichondrial space (between the perichondrium and cartilage). This collection of blood is a mechanical barrier between the cartilage and its perichondrial blood supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-auricular-hematoma-and-cauliflower-ear/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Deprived of perfusion, the underlying cartilage necroses and may become infected. These pathologic changes result in cartilage loss followed by fibrosis and neocartilage formation. This healing process is disorganized and results in the cosmetic deformity of cauliflower ear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F87691\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87691 \">picture 1</a>). Early drainage of the hematoma and re-apposition of the perichondrial layer to the underlying cartilage restores perfusion to the cartilage and reduces the likelihood of cauliflower ear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3540822\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Auricular hematoma and cauliflower ear are common sports injuries. While epidemiologic data are lacking, rugby, boxing, wrestling, and mixed martial arts or &quot;ultimate fighting&quot; are the sports typically associated with these injuries. Fighters who do not wear protective head gear are at greater risk. As an example, in a survey of collegiate wrestlers, auricular injuries occurred more frequently among wrestlers who were not wearing headgear (52 versus 26 percent for auricular hematoma and 27 versus 11 percent for cauliflower ear, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-auricular-hematoma-and-cauliflower-ear/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Fighters with auricular hematoma also tend to ignore the injury and, even if treated, risk recurrent injury with ultimate development of cauliflower ear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-auricular-hematoma-and-cauliflower-ear/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3540829\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of auricular hematoma or cauliflower ear is made by the characteristic clinical appearance in patients with a history of blunt trauma to the auricle.</p><p>Acute auricular hematoma presents as a tender, tense, fluctuant collection of blood, typically on the anterior aspect of the pinna and often within the scaphoid fossa, the depression between the helix and antihelix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57847\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57847 \">figure 1</a>). The overlying skin can be erythematous or ecchymotic. If the hematoma has begun to clot and organize (approximately 24 hours after injury), it may become firmer.</p><p>By contrast, cauliflower ear is a chronic, bulbous deformity of the pinna in the area of a former auricular hematoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F87691\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87691 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Most auricular hematomas result from an isolated blow to the ear during sports and have few associated injuries. Less commonly, auricular hematomas may accompany serious injury to the head, ear drum, or middle ear during motor vehicle collisions or other high energy mechanisms. The assessment and management of these injuries are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-management-of-auricle-ear-lacerations#H28089227\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and management of auricle (ear) lacerations&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-middle-ear-trauma#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of middle ear trauma&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation#H89479938\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor head trauma in infants and children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3540836\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most patients, the diagnosis of auricular hematoma or cauliflower ear is straightforward. Infections of the ear cartilage or inflammation from relapsing polychondritis may occasionally mimic these injuries.</p><p>Perichondritis, chondritis, or auricular abscess present with pain, swelling, and erythema of the overlying skin. Fluctuant swelling indicates an abscess. These infections typically accompany a recent helical ear piercing or laceration but have physical findings that may be difficult to differentiate from an auricular hematoma in some patients. The presence of pus rather than blood at the time of drainage indicates an auricular abscess. A prior break in the skin followed by erythema often identifies perichondritis or chondritis. Further therapy includes antibiotic treatment which is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-management-of-auricle-ear-lacerations#H5325954\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and management of auricle (ear) lacerations&quot;, section on 'Perichondritis or chondritis'</a>.)</p><p>Relapsing polychondritis (RPC) is an uncommon autoimmune condition in adults that can mimic traumatic cauliflower ear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F82354\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82354 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F87692\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87692 \">picture 3</a>). Auricular involvement is the most frequent feature of RPC, but other anatomic areas and organs may be involved, including the costal cartilage, eyes, nose, airways, heart, vascular system, skin, joints, kidney, and nervous system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76071\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76071 \">table 1</a>). Involvement of other anatomic areas or organs and the presence of nonspecific constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, and fever help to distinguish RPC from cauliflower ear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-relapsing-polychondritis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of relapsing polychondritis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3540847\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SUBSPECIALTY CONSULTATION OR REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All auricular hematomas should be drained as soon as possible after injury. Hematomas greater than seven days old may have begun to organize and form granulation tissue and warrant referral to an otolaryngologist or plastic surgeon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-auricular-hematoma-and-cauliflower-ear/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Most auricular hematomas occur in healthy young athletes. However, anticoagulated patients may develop auricular hematomas after incidental trauma. The approach to these patients depends upon the indication for anticoagulation, the individual risk of thromboembolism if anticoagulation is interrupted, and the type of anticoagulant the patient is receiving. In some cases, referral to an otolaryngologist or plastic surgeon for delayed drainage after anticoagulation is reduced or interrupted may be necessary. Consultation with a hematologist is advised to guide management of anticoagulation before and after hematoma drainage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-patients-receiving-anticoagulants#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants&quot;, section on 'Overview of our approach'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3540861\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3540869\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation and patient counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient's ear should be examined both visually and by palpation to determine the location and extent of the hematoma. Physical findings determine the type of drainage (needle aspiration versus incision and drainage) and the surgical approach. (See <a href=\"#H1279686\" class=\"local\">'Approach'</a> below.)</p><p>The patient or caregiver should be informed regarding the need for drainage to reduce, but not eliminate the chances of cauliflower ear, and the need for appropriate follow-up. They should also be counseled regarding the need to avoid reinjury to the ear while it is healing; this is important in the case of athletes who are anxious to return to training. The clinician should emphasize that re-accumulation of blood will result in a poor cosmetic outcome. (See <a href=\"#H972308\" class=\"local\">'Return to sports'</a> below.)</p><p>Additional risks that should be reviewed during the informed consent process include bleeding, infection, pain, scar formation, and need for further surgery. For anticoagulated patients, consultation with a hematologist is advised to guide management of anticoagulation before and after hematoma drainage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-patients-receiving-anticoagulants#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants&quot;, section on 'Overview of our approach'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3540876\"><span class=\"h2\">Analgesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A regional auricular block using a local anesthetic, such as 1 or 2 percent buffered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> usually provides adequate anesthesia for drainage of an auricular hematoma in the cooperative patient. Of note, lidocaine with epinephrine is helpful for regional blocks but is generally avoided in direct infiltration of the ear itself as the vasoconstrictive properties of epinephrine can compromise the auricular blood supply. The discomfort of infiltration may be further decreased by the use of nonpharmacologic interventions such as biobehavioral and cognitive distraction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-management-of-auricle-ear-lacerations#H3624313\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and management of auricle (ear) lacerations&quot;, section on 'Local anesthesia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room#H1684879\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in children outside of the operating room&quot;, section on 'Nonpharmacologic interventions'</a>.)</p><p>The technique for performing a regional auricular block is discussed in detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77328\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77328 \">figure 2</a>).

Our approach depends upon the size and age of the auricular hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-auricular-hematoma-and-cauliflower-ear/abstract/1,4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,6,7</a>]. Auricular hematomas that are more than seven days old warrant referral to a surgical subspecialist for debridement of new perichondrial growth and any remaining hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-auricular-hematoma-and-cauliflower-ear/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3540847\" class=\"local\">'Indications for treatment and subspecialty consultation or referral'</a> above.)</p><p>We suggest that patients with auricular hematomas that are &lt;2 cm in diameter and present for up to 48 hours undergo needle aspiration rather than either incision and drainage, or evacuation using an intravascular catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-auricular-hematoma-and-cauliflower-ear/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1278699\" class=\"local\">'Small, acute auricular hematomas'</a> below.)</p><p>We suggest that patients with auricular hematomas &ge;2 cm in diameter and all hematomas present from 48 hours up to seven days receive either incision and drainage or evacuation using an intravascular catheter rather than needle aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-auricular-hematoma-and-cauliflower-ear/abstract/1,4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1280154\" class=\"local\">'Larger auricular hematomas'</a> below.)</p><p>Some experts favor incision and drainage over needle aspiration for all auricular hematomas to avoid recurrent hematoma and its sequelae. In one small observational study of 22 patients undergoing 28 treatments, hematoma reaccumulation occurred in three out of seven patients after needle aspiration (18 to 22 gauge needles were used) versus 2 out of 21 patients undergoing incision and drainage, although this difference was not statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-auricular-hematoma-and-cauliflower-ear/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, outcomes were not controlled for age and size of the hematomas. Our experience suggests that needle aspiration of small, acute auricular hematomas is frequently successful.</p><p>In another series of 53 wrestlers with auricular hematoma at least 2 cm in size and present for up to three weeks, reaccumulation was seen in only three patients after evacuation with an indwelling 18 gauge intravenous catheter; the catheter had fallen out in all of these patients during the first three days after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-auricular-hematoma-and-cauliflower-ear/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This technique permitted return to sports within seven days in 91 percent of patients. Cauliflower ear developed in one athlete who did not use headgear.</p><p>Thus, limited observational evidence suggests that either incision and drainage or evacuation with an indwelling intravenous catheter effectively treats large auricular hematomas (&ge;2 cm) with similar rates of reaccumulation or development of cauliflower ear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1278699\"><span class=\"h2\">Small, acute auricular hematomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician may perform needle aspiration for small (less than approximately 2 cm in diameter) and acute hematomas that are 24 to 48 hours old as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-auricular-hematoma-and-cauliflower-ear/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>] (see <a href=\"#H1279686\" class=\"local\">'Approach'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cleanse the ear with antiseptic (eg, povidone-iodine solution).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide local anesthesia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77328\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77328 \">figure 2</a>).

If the hematoma is not drained, disruption of blood supply to the auricular cartilage causes necrosis, increases the chance of infection, and usually results in a cauliflower ear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F87691\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87691 \">picture 1</a>). Wrestlers, boxers, and participants in mixed martial arts are predisposed.

Auricular hematomas that are more than seven days old warrant referral to an otolaryngologist or plastic surgeon for debridement of new perichondrial growth and any remaining hematoma. (See <a href=\"#H3540847\" class=\"local\">'Indications for treatment and subspecialty consultation or referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A regional auricular block using local anesthetic, such as 1 or 2 percent buffered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, usually provides adequate anesthesia for auricular hematoma drainage in the cooperative patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77328\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77328 \">figure 2</a>).
