However, there are several studies that have attempted to address the impact of antibiotic prophylaxis on risk for IE. A systematic review and meta-analysis including 21 trials, 10 time-trend studies, and five observational studies (discussed below) noted that the evidence base for use of antibiotic prophylaxis is limited and heterogeneous, and the methodological quality of many studies is poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H298040541\" class=\"local\">'Effect of antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p>Even if antibiotic prophylaxis is effective, its utility is limited by the frequency of IE without any identifiable preceding procedure, the low rate of IE following procedures such as dental work without prophylaxis, and the potential for prophylaxis failure. (See <a href=\"#H1148095883\" class=\"local\">'On risk of endocarditis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3011008605\" class=\"local\">'Impact of procedures on risk of endocarditis'</a> below.)</p><p>It has been estimated that, even if antimicrobial prophylaxis is fully effective, less than 10 percent of all cases of endocarditis could be prevented by use of antimicrobial therapy prior to procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Various epidemiologic studies have shown that up to 5 percent of all cases are preceded by a dental procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. However, even in cases in which there is a close temporal relationship between a dental procedure and the occurrence of endocarditis, causality is uncertain; it is possible that endocarditis occurred as a consequence of the dental condition that led to the procedure or from routine tooth brushing. (See <a href=\"#H3011008605\" class=\"local\">'Impact of procedures on risk of endocarditis'</a> below.)</p><p>An epidemiologic study from France estimated that the risk of developing IE following a dental procedure in adults with predisposing cardiac conditions was 1 in 11,000 for patients with prosthetic valves and no prophylaxis, 1 in 54,000 for patients with native valves and no prophylaxis, and 1 in 150,000 for patients who received prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Thus, a large number of prophylaxis doses would be necessary to prevent a very small number of IE cases, suggesting that only the highest risk procedures and populations should receive prophylaxis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3011008605\"><span class=\"h3\">Impact of procedures on risk of endocarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Invasive dental procedures and other procedures may contribute to the risk of IE, although most cases of IE do not occur after a procedure.</p><p>The impact of invasive procedures on the risk of endocarditis in patients with prosthetic valves was assessed by a French population-based cohort and case crossover study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

However, in the case-control analysis, invasive dental procedures were more frequent during case periods, defined as the 3 months preceding oral streptococcal IE, than during control periods, defined as months 9 to 7 before, months 15 to 13 before, and months 21 to 19 before in the same participants (5.1 versus 3.2 percent; odds ratio 1.66, 95% CI 1.05-2.63).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H298040541\"><span class=\"h3\">Effect of antibiotic prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic trials have examined the impact of antibiotic prophylaxis on bacteremia, but only limited observational data are available on the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on the risk of IE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4108825430\"><span class=\"h4\">On bacteremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All antibiotic prophylaxis trials (21 included in the meta-analysis) used bacteremia as an endpoint rather than IE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In a meta-analysis of three case-control studies of patients undergoing dental or other invasive procedures, there was no statistically significant difference in exposure to antibiotic prophylaxis between patients with IE and controls, but the studies were underpowered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In the above-cited French population-based cohort study, among 138,876 adults with prosthetic heart valves, there were 103,463 invasive dental procedures meeting criteria for antibiotic prophylaxis, which was prescribed for 52,280 procedures (50.1 percent). The incidence of IE in the three months after an invasive dental procedure was nominally but not significantly lower in patients taking antibiotic prophylaxis (78.1 per 100,000 person years, 95% CI 1.6-154.6) compared with those not taking antibiotic prophylaxis (149.5 per 100,000 person years, 95% CI 56.8-242.2).</p><p>Even if antibiotic prophylaxis reduces risk of IE, it may fail.

In the 43 cases with antimicrobial susceptibility data, 63 percent of the pathogens were susceptible to the prophylactic antimicrobial agents that were administered.

However, a causal connection is uncertain given the absence of controlled data. Factors that may contribute to perceived increasing rates of IE include lower thresholds for diagnosis of IE, increased prevalence of risk factors, increases in procedures predisposing to IE, and inaccurate coding or counting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The above cited systematic review included 10 time-trend studies examining the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis guideline change on the incidence of IE, including nine studies of relative antibiotic prophylaxis restriction and one study examining the effect of total antibiotic prophylaxis restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the studies of the effect of relative antibiotic prophylaxis restriction (from the United States and Europe), there was no significant change in the overall rate of increase of IE.

Guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom recommended complete cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of IE in March 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. By March 2013, 35 more cases of IE per month were reported than expected based upon the historical trend. In 2016, the NICE guidelines were revised to include the word &quot;routinely&quot; in the following statement: &quot;Antibiotic prophylaxis against infective endocarditis is not recommended <strong>routinely</strong> for people undergoing dental procedures&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22969468\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antimicrobial prophylaxis is suggested for patients with cardiac conditions that confer the highest risk of adverse outcome from infective endocarditis (IE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>]. Guidelines issued prior to 2007 recommended prophylaxis for patients at moderate to high risk of IE, a much larger population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>There is no convincing evidence that antimicrobial prophylaxis provides significant benefit in terms of prevention of IE in many cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. IE is much more likely to result from frequent exposure to random bacteremias associated with daily activities such as tooth brushing than from bacteremia caused by a dental, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary procedure. Furthermore, the risk of antibiotic-associated adverse events may exceed the benefit, if any, from prophylactic antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Maintenance of optimal oral hygiene may reduce the incidence of bacteremia from daily activities and is more important than prophylactic antibiotics for a dental procedure to reduce the risk of IE.</p><p>The antibiotic regimens for prevention of endocarditis are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57182\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57182 \">table 1</a>). In general, antibiotics should be administered 30 to 60 minutes prior to the procedure (an exception is intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>, which should be administered 120 minutes prior to the procedure).
