Depression is associated with a less favorable patient course and poorer outcomes compared to patients with schizophrenia without depression.</p><p>The diagnosis of depression in schizophrenia is complicated by a differential diagnosis that includes depression-like extrapyramidal side effect symptoms of antipsychotic drugs, negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and organic conditions. In addition to thorough assessment, treatment trials can be used to differentiate these conditions. </p><p>The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of depression in patients with schizophrenia are discussed here. Depression and schizophrenia as individual, non-comorbid disorders are discussed separately. Other common comorbidities of schizophrenia are also discussed separately.

Overall, studies have found a modal prevalence of approximately 25 percent, well above the rate of depression in the general population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-neurobiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and neurobiology&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Risk factors for depression in schizophrenia include family history of depressive disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], high levels of family and personal expectations for success in life, critical family attitudes, high levels of family expressed emotion, stigma, intelligence and insight, multiple hospitalizations, recent hospital discharge, and lack or loss of psychosocial support or support of self-esteem. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H931455692\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depression occurring in schizophrenia can be conceptualized in several ways. These include depression as a component of the underlying psychopathology of schizophrenia itself, a domain on a spectrum of pathology which extends from &ldquo;purely affective&rdquo; at one extreme to &ldquo;purely psychotic&rdquo; at the other, or co-occurrence of affective and psychotic pathology in the same individual. </p><p>What is known about the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and depression as individual disorders provides a starting point toward understanding the pathogenesis of this comorbidity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-neurobiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and neurobiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-neurobiology#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and neurobiology&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H931455699\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &ldquo;depression&rdquo; is used to describe several different phenomena. It can refer to an affect, a symptom, or a syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As an affect, &ldquo;depression&rdquo; refers to a nonpathological, transient feeling state of low mood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As a symptom, &ldquo;depression&rdquo; refers to an exaggerated feeling state of low mood, exaggerated in that it occurs in the absence of sufficient stimulus, is more severe than appropriate, or lasts longer than would otherwise be expected. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As a syndrome, &ldquo;depression&rdquo; refers to a persisting clinical condition that features low mood or anhedonia along with elements such as low energy, self-reproach, impaired concentration, pessimism, guilt, lack of confidence, sleep or appetite disturbances, psychomotor agitation or retardation, or notions of self-harm, death, and suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p>As is the case for individuals who do not have schizophrenia, patients with schizophrenia can have &ldquo;depression&rdquo; in any of these three senses of the term. When we refer to depression in patients with schizophrenia in clinical practice or in the psychiatric literature, we are typically referring to the symptom or syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H931455706\"><span class=\"h1\">COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The course of depressive symptoms occurring in schizophrenia varies based on the underlying cause of the condition and the treatment received. Environmental factors also influence the course of depression in both patients with and without schizophrenia.</p><p>Depressive symptoms can occur either during an acute psychotic episode or subsequently to it. When depression occurs during the acute psychosis, its presentation is often less dramatic than the psychotic symptoms and it may therefore be less apparent. Depression occurring in the course of an acute psychotic episode frequently remits as the psychosis subsides in response to an antipsychotic agent. At other times, however, a depressive syndrome may persist (and consequently appear to emerge) as the psychosis improves.</p><p>Depression has been found to be associated with a variety of undesirable outcomes in schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/1,3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,9</a>]. These include higher rates of relapse and early rehospitalization, longer durations of hospitalization, greater symptom burden, poorer responses to psychopharmacological interventions, greater impairments in cognitive functioning, more impairments in social and vocational functioning, more personal suffering, increased family and community burden, and more life events involving permanent loss or other unfavorable life occurrences. Depression in schizophrenia has been associated with increased rates of suicide attempts and completed suicides, the latter estimated at between 4 and 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H931455713\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis of a depressive syndrome in the context of schizophrenia requires the consideration of other diagnoses with overlapping presentations. The differential diagnosis of depression in schizophrenia includes organic factors, features of schizophrenia, antipsychotic side effects, disappointment reactions, and a co-occurring depressive disorder. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H931455727\"><span class=\"h2\">Organic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many conditions that can biologically predispose schizophrenic patients to a depression or depression-like symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Medical conditions and other organic factors are summarized in the table and discussed in greater detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52373\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52373 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H931455734\"><span class=\"h2\">Antipsychotic drug-induced dysphoria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antipsychotic medications have been observed to produce a dysphoria as a side effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/1,3,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,15</a>]. This has been reported particularly with first-generation antipsychotic compounds, but has also been found to occur with second-generation antipsychotic agents. All antipsychotic medications interfere with dopamine neurotransmission as a component of their activity, and dopamine neurotransmission has been found to figure prominently in <span class=\"nowrap\">pleasure/reward</span> pathways in the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/3,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16,17</a>]. Blocking of dopamine transmission by antipsychotics may be responsible, at least in part, for the dysphoria experienced by a proportion of patients taking the medication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and comparative side effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-side-effect-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia: Side effect management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H931455741\"><span class=\"h2\">Extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First generation and some second generation antipsychotics are known to produce the extrapyramidal side effects of akinesia and akathisia. While blatant forms of akinesia and akathisia are distinctive, more subtle forms can be difficult to distinguish from depression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and comparative side effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-side-effect-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia: Side effect management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The subtle form of akinesia affects small muscle groups, typically the facial muscles of expression, producing an expressionless or &ldquo;mask-like&rdquo; appearance, and the larynx, decreasing voice tone and expressiveness. Akinesia also can adversely affect the part of the basal ganglia responsible for initiating and sustaining motor behavior. Such patients behave as if their &ldquo;starter motor&rdquo; is broken, appearing to be non-spontaneous. The patient&rsquo;s subjective experience is that activities are &ldquo;not worth the effort&rdquo;; they often perceive themselves self-critically as being &ldquo;lazy,&rdquo; which contributes to a negative effect on mood. It is easy to see how this combination of factors could lead to a combination of depression and depression-like symptoms on both a psychological and physiological basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Patients with akathisia are fidgety and feel unable to stop moving; they can find the experience to be intensely dysphoric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In a subtle manifestation of akathisia, patients may be observed to be &ldquo;action-prone,&rdquo; over-talkative, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> having the tendency to wander into other people&rsquo;s space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A dysphoric, subtle akathisia can be difficult to distinguish from the syndrome of depression. Akathisia has also been noted to be a possible risk factor for suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H931455748\"><span class=\"h2\">Negative symptoms of schizophrenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The &ldquo;negative symptoms&rdquo; syndrome of schizophrenia includes a number of features which are similar to components of the depression syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. These features include anhedonia (lack of pleasure), anergia (lack of energy), alogia (lack of having things to say or lack of content in what is said), blunted affect, social withdrawal, and loss of drive or motivation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis#H17284567\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Schizophrenia in adults: Clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Negative symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>A depressive syndrome is distinguished from negative symptoms in schizophrenia by the presence of cognitive features of depression (guilt, shame, low self-esteem, ideas of worthlessness, notions of helplessness, pessimism, and suicidal thoughts), and the prominent affective manifestations of depressed mood (such as intense low mood or tearfulness). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H931455755\"><span class=\"h2\">Prodrome of a psychotic episode</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depression has commonly been described as one of the symptoms experienced by schizophrenic patients during the prodrome of a new psychotic episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/1,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,26,27</a>]. Studies have reported the presence of depression-like symptoms in 28 to 76 percent of such patients. These patients are often dysphoric and socially withdrawn. They may experience sleep or appetite irregularities, manifest variations in their energy levels, lose interest in their surroundings, have trouble concentrating, express thoughts of hopelessness, helplessness, or self-blame, and anticipate punishment or catastrophe. The prodrome of a psychotic episode generally lasts days to a couple of weeks at most. By then, psychosis has typically become more evident with the emergence or exacerbation of hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the eruption of disjointed fragments of behavior.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H931455762\"><span class=\"h2\">Disappointment reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An acute disappointment reaction can occur in response to a loss or failure of plans to work out. Persons with schizophrenia, for example, may be disappointed about the way in which their lives are progressing (or not progressing). A negative subjective reaction to the advent of a new episode of decompensation would certainly qualify as such a disappointment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In this circumstance, &ldquo;insight&rdquo; into their situation can be a contributing factor as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>What distinguishes an acute disappointment reaction from a depressive syndrome is the presence of an unpleasant event or precipitating circumstance and the fact that such a reaction does not last for an extended period (generally a few hours or days, up to a couple weeks). Patients with schizophrenia may have a limited capability for self-expression or idiosyncratic interpretations of events, requiring patient, careful listening to understand them.</p><p>Chronic disappointment reactions can also occur and this situation is sometimes referred to as the &ldquo;demoralization&rdquo; syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. This state can present depressive symptoms in that the patient feels chronically discouraged and dispirited, expresses pessimism, has a sense of loss of control, is preoccupied with past failures and their consequences, pleads incompetence, and behaves in an avoidant manner. Again, &ldquo;insight&rdquo; into the situation may be a contributing factor for &ldquo;depression&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H931455769\"><span class=\"h2\">Depression in schizophrenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A depressive disorder may be diagnosed in the context of schizophrenia when a&nbsp;patient, who has otherwise been diagnosed as having schizophrenia and is currently not floridly psychotic, manifests a depression syndrome (meeting DSM-5 criteria for a depressive disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]), and other items in the differential diagnosis have been excluded. Postpsychotic depressive syndrome is a historically used term to describe depression occurring&nbsp;in schizophrenia when the patient is no longer floridly psychotic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The syndrome appeared in an appendix of DSM-IV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], as proposed for further research, but does not appear in DSM-5.

The diagnosis requires the patient to have had at least one two-week period of illness during which <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> experiences hallucinations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delusions in the absence of any prominent mood episode.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H931455776\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment and treatment of depression in patients with schizophrenia are closely intertwined and performed in tandem, guided by the differential diagnosis. Periods of observation and clinical interventions can be used to identify or rule out possible diagnoses.</p><p>When a patient with schizophrenia presents with a new episode of depression, the first step is watchful waiting. During this time, the patient can be assessed and carefully monitored. The medical history, physical exam, and laboratory testing can identify or rule out organic factors potentially contributing to depression.</p><p>If the depression lasts for more than two weeks, and the patient&rsquo;s clinical state remains relatively unchanged, then a prodrome of a psychotic disorder and an acute disappointment reaction have largely been ruled out. Treatment is then guided by the remaining diagnostic possibilities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H931455783\"><span class=\"h2\">Antipsychotic medication effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The next step is to determine through intervention whether the depression is a product of the patient&rsquo;s antipsychotic medication, either as a direct mood effect or as an extrapyramidal side effect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and comparative side effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-side-effect-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia: Side effect management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If possible, a cautious downward titration of the antipsychotic medication dose should be attempted first, with continuing close monitoring of the patient for exacerbation of psychosis and change in depressive symptoms. This can be tried in patients who are not experiencing an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms and are receiving more than the minimally recommended antipsychotic dose or, if the patient&rsquo;s history of antipsychotic treatment is known, more than the minimal dose that has been historically required to control his or her psychotic symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the patient with EPS where an antipsychotic dose reduction is not possible or inadequate, an appropriate antiparkinsonian agent may be added, or increased if already present, to treat or rule out extrapyramidal symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For akinesia, we suggest treatment with an anticholinergic antiparkinsonian medication. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benztropine-benzatropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Benztropine</a> may be started at 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in divided doses and increased gradually every three to four days to 6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in the absence of substantive side effects such as constipation, blurry vision, dry mouth, or the history or presence of glaucoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the patient experiences anticholinergic side effects, non-anticholinergic antiparkinsonian medications may be employed, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amantadine</a>, 100 mg orally two to three times daily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For akathisia, we suggest treatment with a benzodiazepine or a beta blocker. A benzodiazepine such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> may be started at 0.5 mg orally twice daily. If the symptoms do not resolve, and the patient has not experienced side effects including ataxia and sedation, the medication can be incrementally raised up to 6 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If treatment with a benzodiazepine is not effective, a beta blocker such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> can be used. Propranolol may be started at 10 mg orally twice daily and can be gradually increased up to 20 mg three times daily. Blood pressure needs to be monitored with the use of a beta blocker.</p><p/><p>An alternative to adding a medication to treat EPS would be a change of antipsychotic medications. If a patient is on an antipsychotic drug likely to cause EPS (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>), for example, substituting an antipsychotic with a lower risk of EPS (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a>) may be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/2,33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,33-36</a>].

Depressive-symptom reduction is more likely when psychotic symptoms are not currently florid and symptom causes other than depression have been treated or ruled out. (See <a href=\"#H931455783\" class=\"local\">'Antipsychotic medication effects'</a> above.)</p><p>A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of patients with schizophrenia treated with antipsychotic medication found that adjunctive treatment with an antidepressant led to reductions in depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference: -0.25, 95% CI = -0.38 to -0.12) and in negative symptoms (SMD: -0.30, 95% CI = -0.44 to -0.16) compared with placebo or no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. A total of 82 trials with 3602 patients were included in the analysis. The number needed to treat (NNT) to show benefit was five (NNT, 95% CI = 4-7). No particular problems were found with emergent side effects in the patients receiving antidepressants compared with controls. There was no difference between the two groups in emergent psychotic symptoms.

Many were relatively small; only one attempted to exclude patients who might have been suffering from neuroleptic-induced akinesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Most of the trials involved tricyclic antidepressants rather than the newer serotonin agents. </p><p>There have been no published head-to-head comparisons between different antidepressants in schizophrenia and it remains unclear if there are meaningful differences among the various available agents. Both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have been reported to be effective in this role, although SSRIs might be expected to be associated with fewer side effects.</p><p>The addition of antidepressant medication to the antipsychotic regimen of acutely psychotic schizophrenic patients may delay the antipsychotic response time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]; however, this does not seem to occur in patients where the psychosis is only residually active. Since the depressive symptoms which are observed in the midst of an acute psychotic episode frequently fade away as the psychotic episode subsides, there is no advantage to be gained by attempting to treat symptoms of depression with antidepressant medications in schizophrenia during an acute psychotic episode. Psychosocial supports would be better suited for that circumstance. </p><p>For a patient experiencing major depression and schizophrenia, who is not floridly psychotic, we suggest treatment of depression with one of the SSRIs. The antidepressant should be titrated gradually up to a therapeutic dose (or level if applicable) with maintenance of a steady antipsychotic-drug dose. As an example of treatment with an SSRI, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a> 50 mg can be added to an ongoing regimen of antipsychotic medication for a schizophrenic patient with depression, and increased by 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> per week to a final dose of 150 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (the higher dose in the absence of side effects). The medication should be continued at this dose for at least six weeks.</p><p>Some SSRIs (especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluvoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluvoxamine</a>) interact with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> leading to toxic clozapine levels in some individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Fluvoxamine should be avoided in patients receiving clozapine. Other SSRIs should be used with caution and accompanied by monitoring of clozapine drug levels.</p><p>If the patient&rsquo;s clinical response to the SSRI trial is inadequate, then the SSRI can be tapered and an adjunctive TCA could be given instead. The evidence is strongest for adjunctive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipramine</a>, which can be started at 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for the first week, and increased by 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> per week to a final dose of 150 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (depending on side effects). Six weeks at this dose would constitute an adequate trial, although more time may be required to achieve the maximum benefit.</p><p>If SSRIs or tricyclic antidepressants are not helpful or well tolerated, other categories of antidepressants may be tried as adjunctive agents, but there is an absence of controlled trials assessing their efficacy.</p><p>In selecting an antidepressant to treat depression in a patient with schizophrenia, the patient&rsquo;s history should be carefully reviewed for antidepressants or antidepressant-antipsychotic combinations that the patient has responded to in the past. The medication history of a close biological relative with these conditions may also provide useful guidance.</p><p>During an antidepressant trial, antipsychotic medication should be continued because antidepressant treatment in the absence of co-treatment with an antipsychotic agent in persons with schizophrenia has been associated with exacerbation of psychosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/2,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,45</a>]. </p><p>For patients who respond favorably to the addition of adjunctive antidepressant medication, long-term maintenance treatment with this combination is recommended. A small randomized trial suggested that continuation of an adjunctive antidepressant could prevent relapse in patients with schizophrenia who had initially responded to the antidepressant with a reduction in depressive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. If the antidepressant is to be discontinued, a gradually tapering of the medication over the course of a month is recommended. </p><p>Contrary to some beliefs, anticholinergic antiparkinsonian medication can be safely administered concurrently with antidepressant and antipsychotic medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], although it would be prudent to obtain an EKG before embarking on this combined medication trial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H243697441\"><span class=\"h3\">Other depressive disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is little research to guide the decision to treat depressive disorders other than major depression (eg, dysthymia). A reasonable approach would be to weigh the potential risk of medication side effects versus the potential benefit of the added adjunctive antidepressant. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H252482631\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with schizophrenia who are undergoing medication changes to treat depression or depression-like symptoms should also receive increased structure and support. Increased energy, initiative, and confidence may emerge in response to treatment with antidepressant medication, and the patients <span class=\"nowrap\">(and/or</span> the patient&rsquo;s family) may need help in keeping these factors within the framework of constructive adaptation. Patients should also be monitored with increased frequency for signs of emerging psychotic symptoms resulting from treatment changes. </p><p>As with other patients experiencing a major depression, patients with depression comorbid with schizophrenia should be assessed and monitored for suicidal ideation, intent, and means. A history of past suicidality and suicide attempts should be obtained. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Standard rating scales have often been used to quantify and monitor the course of depressive symptomatology in patients with schizophrenia. The Calgary Depression Scale (CDS) was specifically developed for use in patients with schizophrenia, highlighting affective and cognitive aspects of depression and focusing away from &ldquo;negative&rdquo; and motoric symptoms which could come from other sources in the schizophrenic population (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F62462\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62462 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-schizophrenia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H252482638\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lifetime prevalence of depression in schizophrenia has been estimated to be 25 percent; findings have varied with the patient population studied, definition of depression used, and duration of observation.
