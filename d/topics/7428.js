The impact of this disorder is felt in daycare, preschool, school, and camp settings, environments that are integral to a child's life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The most common food allergies in childhood are milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, and soy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. Peanut allergy is of particular concern in the United States because it is implicated in fatal reactions more than any other food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. However, many foods can cause life-threatening allergic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p>It is crucial for medical professionals to understand the challenge that this disorder presents. The avoidance strategies in place to keep a food-allergic child safe will often impact the entire classroom of children, particularly in the younger age groups.</p><p>This topic review presents an overview of the prevalence of food allergy in school-aged children; provides data about food-allergic reactions in schools, camps, and similar environments; and discusses strategies for managing food allergy in these settings. A similar discussion of food allergy in college or university students is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-in-college-and-university-students-overview-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergy in college and university students: Overview and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The information in this topic review provides an overview of the components of effective management of food allergy in schools and camps. Various detailed publications and educational programs are available that provide further resources, such as additional forms, letters, training instructions, and examples of policies enacted by schools and daycare centers.

The following observations about food allergy are especially relevant:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a survey of 400 elementary school nurses, 44 percent reported an increase in children with food allergies in their schools over a five-year period; only 2 percent reported a decrease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. More than one-third of the nurses reported having 10 or more students with food allergies. The school nurses ranked the challenge of managing food allergies on par with other serious health concerns, such as diabetes. In a study of 170 camps representing 122,424 campers in the US and Canada, 2.5 percent of campers had documented food allergies, although only 39.7 percent brought an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjector to camp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sending a food-allergic child to daycare or school can be terrifying to parents. They must trust that others will be vigilant in helping their child avoid ingestion of the allergen and respond to symptoms of an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. In addition, the widespread misunderstanding of food allergy among the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] may result in both resentment from other parents and fear and confusion on the part of staff members. Additionally, school personnel may lack sufficient knowledge about food allergy and anaphylaxis management, although educational programs may help close the gap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of a food allergen is challenging. In addition to the food served in the cafeteria, there are snacks in classrooms and on the playground. Food items are used for classroom activities, such as art projects, cooking lessons, and math instruction. Examples include craft projects, such as rolling pine cones in peanut butter to make bird feeders, using empty milk containers to create cities, using candy as counting items in math class, or using peanuts in science class. In addition, school supplies may contain hidden allergens: Modeling clay can contain wheat, and egg white may be used to smooth finger paints. Holiday celebrations, birthday parties, and other special events traditionally involve food items prepared at home by the caregivers of non-food-allergic children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-avoidance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Avoidance&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Characteristics of reactions in schools</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insight into the nature of food-allergic reactions in schools has been provided by the following studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/2,3,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although allergic reactions induced by food in schools are not rare, preparation for managing them is often inadequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/2,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19,20</a>]. In a telephone survey of 80 schools and the parents of 132 food-allergic children, 39 percent of schools reported at least one food-allergic reaction during the prior two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the same period, 58 percent of food-allergic students experienced a reaction at school, and, of those, 30 percent did not have clinician's instructions or medication available at school at the time of their reaction. Preparation for management of food-allergic reactions in schools may differ by socioeconomic status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Milk and peanut are leading causes of school reactions in the United States. In one study, milk was reported to be the most common cause of allergic reactions in the preschool setting and peanut the leading cause in children in the kindergarten through high-school years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In two surveys, 16 to 18 percent of children with food allergy were reported to have had at least one allergic reaction while in school, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> was used in 15 to 28 percent of these reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Food-allergic reactions may take place anywhere there are students. A review of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> use in Massachusetts schools over a two-year period (2001 to 2003) reported 115 administrations of epinephrine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In 20 percent of these cases, the allergic reaction occurred outside the school building: on the playground, traveling to and from school, and on field trips.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A significant percentage of children were not known to have food allergy upon entering school and had their initial food-allergic reaction at school. Two studies found that 25 percent of the food allergy reactions in the schools were initial reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/3,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Special event and craft foods are particularly problematic. A study of peanut and tree nut reactions in the school setting showed that the majority of the reactions occurred in the classroom (79 percent), principally from food brought in for class projects or celebrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Fatal food reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peanut is the food most often implicated in fatal reactions, although any immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy has the potential to cause severe or fatal reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The percent of fatal reactions reported to occur in a school or child care setting in studies of fatal food allergy-induced reactions ranges from 10 to 67 percent.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Epinephrine</a> should be administered by intramuscular injection as soon as possible in the setting of anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Delayed administration of epinephrine is believed to be a contributing factor in some fatal reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In the study mentioned above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], six of the seven children who survived anaphylaxis received epinephrine within 30 minutes of ingesting the allergen, whereas only two of the six children who died received epinephrine within the first hour.</p><p>Fatal food-allergic reactions are most common in adolescents and young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Possible contributing factors that are also risk-taking behaviors associated with adolescence include reduced diligence in avoidance of allergens and delay in using or not carrying self-injectable <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In an internet-based anonymous survey of 176 adolescents and young adults with food allergy, more than one-half reported purposefully ingesting a potentially unsafe food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. As a group, the respondents felt that education of their peers about food allergy would help them cope better with having food allergy. Thus, one strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality in this age group might be increased education on a school-wide basis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of avoidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Strict avoidance of the causative food is critical for avoiding an allergic reaction. However, absolute avoidance is extremely difficult, making accidental exposures almost inevitable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/2,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25</a>].</p><p>Because avoidance is so difficult, schools and similar settings must have plans in place for both effective allergen avoidance and emergency management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-avoidance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Avoidance&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGING FOOD ALLERGY IN SCHOOLS AND CAMPS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Schools and camps should be proactive in planning how to manage food-allergic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/5,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,26-28</a>]. Planning ahead can save valuable minutes when a reaction occurs and may be the difference between life and death for a child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Institutional food allergy management plan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The food allergy management plan of a school or camp should include policies regarding the use of food throughout the day and in various activities, where medications will be kept, and protocols for contacting emergency services and parents during a reaction. Guidelines for managing students with food allergies, developed in consultation with a number of professional societies, have been published (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78534\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78534 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. Preliminary evidence supports the usefulness of such policies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Resources'</a> below.)</p><p>Education about food allergy and its treatment should be provided to all staff who supervise children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/28,29,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29,32</a>]. Staff to receive training should include teachers, coaches, administrators, transportation drivers, dining <span class=\"nowrap\">hall/cafeteria</span> workers, camp nurses, counselors, specialty area workers, volunteers, chaperones, and anyone else who may offer food or be involved with parties, events, or activities. School nurses may not be available for children at risk, so training of non-nursing staff is key [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>It is essential that the staff responsible for the safety of a food-allergic child is able to do the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recognize a food-allergic reaction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtain access to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> rapidly and reliably</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Know when and how to use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> without first having to contact the child's parent or retrieve the school nurse</p><p/><p>Training and allowing a variety of staff members to administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> is recommended because most schools and camps do not employ full-time nurses. In addition, nurses are often in charge of hundreds or thousands of children in a large physical area.</p><p>Many schools and camps are including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjectors as part of the school's general first aid supplies, in the event of a first-time reaction, or if an additional dose of epinephrine is needed. This is now legally mandated in many states and encouraged in others through federal legislation.</p><p>Food allergy management requires a school-wide approach that may have many facets to ensure allergen avoidance and prompt recognition and treatment of reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In addition, individual students may be provided with an Individualized Health Plan (IHP) addressing daily management. Food allergy may also qualify as a disability under the US federal disability law, and a Section 504 plan or Individualized Education Plan (IEP) can be written to provide accommodations, if needed. The nature of the care to be provided may vary among individual children depending upon their allergies, age, and developmental abilities. As an example, a six-year-old child with severe peanut allergy who may take another child&rsquo;s food may need more supervision than a 12-year-old child with the same allergy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Personalized food allergy action plan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each child who has a food allergy requires a personalized management plan.

These should include what medications and doses to use and timing instructions.</p><p>In some cases, the clinician may be involved in educating school and camp staff and others who may be providing care for the allergic child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Staff's responsibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All individuals on the school or camp staff should understand food allergy, should be able to recognize symptoms and respond to a reaction, and should be vigilant and proactive in eliminating food allergens from the allergic student's meals, educational tools, arts and crafts projects, or incentives. In particular, food service staff must understand how to provide safe, allergen-free meals, including appropriate substitutions, when children with food allergies are obtaining meals from the cafeteria.</p><p>Generally, school or camp nurses conduct training sessions prior to the start of the school year or camp term. During these sessions, relevant staff members can review information about the food-allergic child, treatment protocols, reading food labels, and other risk-reduction strategies designed to keep the child safe.</p><p>Nurses and other staff members should be trained in the proper use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> injectors. They should have access to training devices and should practice using them so that they are confident and capable of administering epinephrine quickly and properly. All staff members should know where epinephrine autoinjectors are stored and should either be trained or be aware of another staff member who has been trained and will be reliably available. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Epinephrine location'</a> below.)</p><p>Staff should contact the local municipal emergency response team and find out if ambulances in the area are equipped with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> and if the attendants are allowed to administer it. Emergency teams differ in this respect, and schools should summon a team that is able to provide this treatment when possible. They should also notify the response team periodically that there are students at the school with life-threatening food allergies. If none of the local emergency teams are able to administer epinephrine, we suggest informing the child's parent of this in writing so that the situation is properly addressed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Bus safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bus drivers are often not employed by the school or camp, but rather are employees working for privately run transportation companies.

School staff should adopt a zero-tolerance policy for bullying, have a plan for quickly handling any reports of this behavior, and institute programs to combat bullying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>A survey of parents of children with food allergy and of teens and young adults with food allergy (n = 353) showed that 24 percent (or 35 percent of participants over age five years) had been victims of bullying, teasing, or harassment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The majority of victims were male (61 percent). The most common trigger for this behavior was simply the individual having a food allergy (79 percent). Other cited causes included their carrying medications, sitting at separate tables, or having other forms of special treatment. The teasing, harassment, and bullying occurred multiple times for most of these individuals (86 percent), primarily in the school settings (82 percent) by classmates (80 percent). Unfortunately, one-fifth of those bullied, teased, or harassed were subjected to this behavior by school staff members. The children and young adults were verbally teased and physically threatened with the food to which they are allergic. Two-thirds of respondents reporting consequences indicated that they or their child felt sad, depressed, and embarrassed or humiliated because of the teasing, bullying, and harassment.</p><p>Similar results were found in another survey of parents and children aged 8 to 17 years with food allergy, with 25 percent of parents and 32 percent of children reporting bullying due to food allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Quality-of-life and distress levels were negatively impacted by bullying in both children and parents, although the effect was lessened in children whose parents were aware of the bullying. Food allergy-related bullying often persists but is less likely to if action is taken, primarily by informing school personnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Strategies for minimizing risks at school</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of strategies for managing food allergies in schools have been devised, although none have been validated. Approaches vary depending on the size of the school, whether or not there is a full-time nurse, the proximity to emergency rescue services (rural versus urban), and the number and age of the students with food allergies. Below are some of the policies that are commonly adopted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No food trading.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No food in the classrooms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No homemade food allowed for class celebrations or parties (commercially prepared foods with preprinted ingredients lists intact are allowed).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Designating the parent of the allergic student to be responsible for selecting food for class celebrations (difficult if there are multiple food-allergic children).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Celebration of birthdays or other special events with books or music instead of food.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Designated allergen-safe tables in the cafeteria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>School-wide food allergy education and management plans.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Education of all students and implementation of student-focused allergy awareness programs. Children should be taught from a young age that teasing other children because of any medical condition is not acceptable. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Resources'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Camp-specific policies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In several respects, the management of food allergy in the camp setting is similar to that in school. Camp staff must be educated in the recognition and treatment of food allergies and anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A personalized food allergy action plan should be provided for each child.</p><p>Selecting a camp that can monitor food and work with the parents to identify risks to the child is critical for success. Parents should discuss their child's food allergies with camp staff as they are choosing a camp. Ideally, the camp should have a full-time nurse and easy access to a medical facility. The parents of the allergic camper are an excellent source of information and guidance for developing a plan for a safe camp experience. Other issues are specific for the camp setting and may vary according to the type and size of the camp and the severity of the camper's allergies. Guidelines for managing food allergies at camp have been published (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71557\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71557 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Camp-specific issues include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ensure that there is phone access in case of a reaction requiring a call to 911.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep medications within easy access and stored in appropriate temperature.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Label each camper's medication and put it in an individual bag that can easily be carried from place to place or allow each camper to carry his or her own medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review foods to be used in craft projects to ensure that they do not contain an allergen that may cause a reaction.</p><p/><p>Special considerations are needed for overnight trips and travel to remote areas, such as bringing extra supplies of safe food for the allergic camper and ample supplies of medications needed to treat a reaction. The supervising staff member should carry a well-charged cell phone and assure that the group will remain in cell phone-accessible territory.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Eating safely at camp</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some parents provide food for their child to minimize the chances of a reaction. For campers staying overnight, parents can ship or personally deliver food at the beginning of each week. The food should be clearly labeled with the child's name and cabin information.</p><p>For children eating camp-provided food, strategies for minimizing risks include separating and labeling &quot;safe&quot; products in the kitchen with stickers so that food can be prepared and served without cross-contamination. Alternatively, if the allergic camper must avoid certain dishes, then allowing that child to be the first in the buffet line and discouraging return trips through the food line for &quot;seconds&quot; should help reduce the risk of a reaction from cross-contact through serving utensils.</p><p>The sharing of care packages of homemade foods should be avoided by those with food allergies, unless prepared by their own parents. Children with food allergies should only consider eating food from care packages if it is commercially prepared and an ingredients list is provided on the packaging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Peanut bans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>School staff and parents may decide to institute peanut-free policies, excluding peanut from schools, specific classrooms, or tables. School-wide bans are particularly controversial because of issues such as a potential false sense of security, difficulty in enforcement, impact on unaffected children, and attention to some food allergens and not others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Unfortunately, reactions have been reported in schools with active peanut bans, indicating that bans are not sufficient to protect allergic children from exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a study of Massachusetts public schools, allergic reactions were still reported in all schools with &quot;peanut-free&quot; policies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Although a number of peanut-free policies were used, schools with peanut-free tables compared with those without this restriction had lower rates of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> administration (2 versus 6 per 100,000 students). Guidelines emphasize that additional safety measures must be in place, even if schools choose to ban specific foods from a classroom or school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>We favor an approach based upon education and cooperation from the entire school community, rather than blanket bans of certain foods. However, bans (in particular allergen-safe tables with increased supervision) are an option for younger children and in specific circumstances. The specific recommendations presented previously should be effective in preventing the majority of reactions and successfully managing the rest. We are not in favor of isolation of the child with food allergy from social settings. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Managing food allergy in schools and camps'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Epinephrine location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children may be permitted to carry self-injectable <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, depending upon local policies. We encourage school staff to recognize that permission to carry is not equivalent to delegation of responsibility solely to the child to self-treat. Ultimately, an adult should be assigned responsibility for ensuring prompt treatment with epinephrine when it is needed.</p><p>In the event that the food-allergic child is not <span class=\"nowrap\">mature/responsible</span> enough to carry their own <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, every effort should be made to ensure that epinephrine is kept in a secure but unlocked location, known to all staff members and accessible within minutes. This sometimes involves epinephrine being &quot;handed off&quot; from teacher to teacher or between camp staff as the child changes locations throughout the day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Providing a safe environment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A focus on avoidance of ingestion of the allergen is key because ingestion is more likely than skin or inhalation exposure to cause anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/27,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,39</a>]. However, special care is needed regarding use of foods in science or craft projects or for younger children who may transfer allergens from hand to mouth.</p><p>Parents and school staff are often concerned about the best methods for removing food from desks, tables, hands, and other surfaces. In one study, investigators sampled the efficacy of a variety of cleaning methods in removing 5 mL of peanut butter from tabletops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The following products effectively reduced peanut allergen to undetectable levels:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain water</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Formula 409 cleaner</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lysol sanitizing wipes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Target brand cleaner with bleach</p><p/><p>Various liquid dishwashing detergents were only partially effective. The investigators concluded that routine cleaning of tables and desks with common cleansers, with the exception of dishwashing liquids, was sufficient to minimize the risk to allergic individuals.</p><p>To remove peanut residue from adults' hands, the following were tested and found effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tidy Tykes Wipes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wet Ones antibacterial wipes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liquid soap</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bar soap</p><p/><p>However, plain water and alcohol-based hand sanitizer did not remove peanut completely from adults' hands. Small children may need help cleaning their hands effectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Legal issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain issues relevant to food allergy in schools and camps have been addressed with specific legislation. These include defining the rights of food-allergic children and protecting those who attempt to help an individual during a food-allergic reaction from subsequent legal action.</p><p>In 2013, the School Access to Emergency <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Epinephrine</a> Act was signed into law in the United States. This act encourages states to adopt laws requiring schools to have &quot;stock&quot; epinephrine autoinjectors on hand. Several studies have underscored the benefit of having stock epinephrine autoinjectors available. In a Chicago survey of school district-issued epinephrine autoinjectors, 55 percent were administered for first-time anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], and, in a survey of 12,275 US schools receiving stock epinephrine autoinjectors, 24.5 percent of administrations involved those with no known allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Legal rights of food-allergic children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with life-threatening food allergies are protected under federal civil rights laws, such as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. This is because a severe food allergy meets the legal definition of a &quot;disability&quot; or &quot;handicap&quot; (ie, a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities [such as eating or breathing]).</p><p>The spirit of these two federal laws is essentially the same: to prevent discrimination on the basis of a disability. The major difference between the laws lies in their application: Section 504 applies to public schools and other institutions that receive federal funding. The ADA, however, typically applies to institutions that are privately run, such as private child care centers, preschools, private schools, and privately run recreational camps.</p><p>Under these laws, schools cannot turn away a child based on the child's food allergies or the school's perceived inability to manage the food allergies. According to the law, facilities must address the health and safety needs of the disabled child and must provide accommodations to ensure that the child participates safely and equally in all normal facets of the program, including classroom activities, field trips, and eating in the cafeteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Similar legislation has been put into effect in other countries. In Ontario, Canada, an Act to Protect Anaphylactic Pupils (Sabrina's Law), which established minimum standards for managing anaphylaxis in schools, was enacted in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Liability for harming a child as a result of improper treatment of allergic reactions is sometimes cited as a concern by schools or camps. However, there is no legal precedent involving a school or camp staff member being sued for administering <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>. In contrast, litigation has been brought against school staff for not responding quickly or appropriately during an anaphylactic reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In addition, most states have &quot;Good Samaritan&quot; laws, which are designed to protect individuals from liability who render emergency assistance in good faith, with no expectation of payment, and who transfer care of the patient to appropriate medical personnel (eg, emergency medical technicians, the school nurse) as soon as possible. Furthermore, some states have enacted Good Samaritan laws that specifically cover epinephrine administration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Resources</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various professional and governmental organizations have created guidance documents on food allergy management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps/abstract/28,30,48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30,48-51</a>].

Approximately one-quarter of these reactions occur in children not previously recognized to have food allergy. Milk and peanut are leading causes of school reactions in the United States. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Characteristics of reactions in schools'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe reactions should be treated with injected <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> administered as rapidly as possible, ideally within a few minutes. Delayed administration of this medication is believed to be a contributing factor in many fatal reactions. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Fatal food reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strict avoidance of the allergy-causing food is extremely difficult. Patients often develop reactions from foods they thought were safe. For these reasons, reactions are virtually inevitable, and schools and similar settings must have plans in place for effective emergency management. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of avoidance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Effective management</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The food allergy management plan of a school or camp should include policies regarding where food is allowed, where medications are stored, and protocols for contacting emergency services and parents during a reaction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78534\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78534 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71557\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71557 \">table 2</a>). It is essential that the staff have access to autoinjectable <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, understand when and how to use it, and have permission to administer it without first having to contact the child's parent or retrieve the school nurse. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Institutional food allergy management plan'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each child who has a food allergy requires a personalized management plan that identifies <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> food allergies, outlines treatment for specific symptoms, and serves as a means of transmitting critical information between the clinician, parent, and staff <a href=\"http://www.foodallergy.org/sites/default/files/migrated-files/file/emergency-care-plan.pdf&amp;token=Vh1FOVYkptiLQmikvZi83sxu+r4LuIvcmJzAJkTo4+vtmqoeqkDq0xHSeatqET0gMr+SYQX06Fhx6IFfRiR1+zD0XM3C19BMhgy0VbQh57NpB/sWu4lPjvgJGLQvk9QJ&amp;TOPIC_ID=5739\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">(Food Allergy Action Plan)</a> <a href=\"http://www.aaaai.org/Aaaai/media/MediaLibrary/PDF+Documents/Libraries/Anaphylaxis-Emergency-Action-Plan.pdf&amp;token=/C5Q/iCB/2LLCwV7T8HK2lwm6sR/kEZoNaIqN/73HXSOVycSIPyputPn68SH00rxz4XgltVFJ9rSmMATkiTNtTCeVQHr44rjlSZkcJVXEDbh+x3d7qqBZUqDAak3uoXk/I0U9CKYd1MPL7MRKdB8kw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5739\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">(Anaphylaxis Emergency Action Plan - English)</a> <a href=\"http://www.aaaai.org/Aaaai/media/MediaLibrary/PDF+Documents/Spanish/Anaphylaxis-Emergency-Action-Plan-Spanish.pdf&amp;token=Ls+BUTXwAuTJRkpRQ4LA1JgGv03onx4w09YFWrjDcTMb8nQK70M4sv3yKBB6Ojk/BSHuni4YwWs1wy9vgRTN0JU2OPH9WbcbiuH8WjlQ7CNVIxv/GWSD5R2OrOOaPAI/dBm3AtkXm1l5Bk3m72nDvg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5739\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">(Anaphylaxis Emergency Action Plan - Spanish)</a>.
