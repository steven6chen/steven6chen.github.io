Conservative approaches to treatment of SUI include pelvic floor muscle training and incontinence pessaries. However, for women who decline or have insufficient improvement following conservative therapy, there are a variety of surgical treatments. The introduction of midurethral slings has changed the decision process for surgical treatment and is likely a factor in the increase in the rate of anti-incontinence surgery in the United States from 0.<span class=\"nowrap\">8/1000</span> women in 1979 to 1.<span class=\"nowrap\">0/1000</span> in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>The process of choosing a surgical procedure for women with SUI who have not had a prior anti-incontinence surgery will be reviewed here.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in women: Preoperative evaluation for a primary procedure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Women who decline or have persistent symptoms following conservative therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, a trial of conservative therapy is advisable prior to surgical treatment because of its low risk profile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Conservative therapy for SUI includes pelvic muscle exercises (PME) with or without biofeedback or incontinence pessaries (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of urinary incontinence in women&quot;</a>). However, some women ultimately need surgical intervention despite such conservative measures. In one study of 198 women treated with PME for SUI, women with severe stress incontinence, age &lt;55 years, and higher educational level were more likely to go on to surgical treatment within 12 months of PME [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>For SUI, surgical treatments have consistently been shown to have a higher efficacy rate than conservative therapy (eg, approximately 40 percent for PME versus 70 to 80 percent for surgery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. As an example, in the only randomized trial to compare surgical and conservative therapy for SUI, midurethral sling surgery compared with physiotherapy had a significantly higher subjective improvement rate (90.8 versus 64.4 percent) and objective cure rate (76.5 versus 58.8 percent) at 12-month follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, SUI surgery is associated with increased morbidity, postoperative voiding difficulty, and development or worsening of urgency incontinence. Thus, surgical intervention is often reserved for those with persistent symptoms despite conservative therapy.</p><p>The minimum evaluation before primary midurethral sling surgery in women with SUI includes: (1) history, (2) urinalysis, (3) physical examination, (4) demonstration of stress urinary incontinence, (5) assessment of urethral mobility, and (6) measurement of postvoid residual urine volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Reduction of urgency symptoms may help the patient sufficiently to avoid surgery for the concomitant stress incontinence symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Mixed incontinence'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women#H16614557\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of urinary incontinence in women&quot;, section on 'Pelvic floor muscle (Kegel) exercises'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3793104\"><span class=\"h2\">Women with occult SUI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advanced pelvic organ prolapse and SUI commonly co-exist; however, in many women, the SUI may become apparent only when the prolapse has been corrected. This phenomenon is known as occult SUI and is not reliably predicted by preoperative urodynamic testing with prolapse reduction. Concomitant anti-incontinence surgery is warranted in some women who are undergoing repair of advanced pelvic organ prolapse. This topic is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence in women: Combined surgical treatment&quot;, section on 'POP with no symptoms of SUI'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Women finished with childbearing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since pelvic support may be disrupted during pregnancy, and particularly following a vaginal birth, most physicians recommend delaying surgical management of SUI until childbearing has been completed.</p><p>The best choice for mode of delivery is uncertain in women who have undergone prior anti-incontinence surgery. A review of case reports suggested that vaginal delivery was associated with a higher risk of recurrent incontinence than cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], but no significant difference was found in a survey of physicians who had performed 3400 retropubic or transobturator midurethral sling procedures (vaginal delivery: 20 percent; cesarean: 13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Women of childbearing age who elect surgical treatment should be counseled on the lack of data regarding the preferred mode of delivery and the risk of recurrent incontinence following delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF PROCEDURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevailing evidence supports using a vaginal approach for anti-incontinence procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaginal approach</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Midurethral sling </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder neck sling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injection of urethral bulking agents</p><p/><p>Currently, bladder neck slings are mainly reserved for women in whom midurethral slings are contraindicated or were unsuccessful. This is largely due to the decrease in morbidity and less voiding dysfunction associated with performing midurethral slings (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Midurethral slings versus other procedures'</a> below). Conditions in which autologous fascia sling in women may be considered include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who decline synthetic materials.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and a nonmobile, fixed urethra. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autologous fascia sling may be preferable to a midurethral sling due to its slightly more obstructive nature. Women undergoing urethral reconstruction (eg, diverticulectomy or fistula repair) are considered for concomitant autologous fascial bladder neck slings. Several investigators reported good incontinence outcomes and low complication rates after urethral diverticulectomy and autologous fascial sling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who have had complications from prior mesh placed in the anterior vagina (for sling or prolapse) may be candidates for autologous fascia sling. Several case series report good outcomes with removal of prior mesh and placement of autologous fascia sling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p/><p>The use of urethral injectable agents is often reserved for women who are unable to tolerate, or wish to defer, surgery. In addition, these agents are used in some patients with recurrent or refractory incontinence after a prior incontinence procedure. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Lack of urethral hypermobility and intrinsic sphincter deficiency'</a> below and <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Women who are elderly or infirm'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The modified Burch retropubic colposuspension (described by Tanagho, also referred to as Burch or retropubic urethropexy) can be performed via laparotomy, conventional laparoscopy, or robot-assisted laparoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1995068058\"><span class=\"h2\">Artificial urinary sphincter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Artificial urinary sphincter placement is rarely used in women but has been reported in several small case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. The procedure can be performed using a vaginal, transabdominal or laparoscopic route for women with stress urinary incontinence and intrinsic sphincter deficiency that is refractory to other common treatments. In this procedure, the Space of Retzius is entered, incisions are made lateral to the bladder neck and the urethra is dissected. An artificial urinary sphincter is circumferentially wrapped around the bladder neck and a fluid-filleeee4d balloon reservoir is left in the Space of Retzius. In one of the largest series, 52 women with intrinsic sphincter deficiency underwent laparoscopic artificial urinary sphincter implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. After a median follow-up of 24 months, 78 percent of women were continent and 16 percent reported improved continence. However, revision of the artificial sphincter was needed in 22 percent of women, including seven patients who required a repeat sphincter placement and four who required permanent removal. Based on the invasive surgery and high revision rate, this procedure is not a first-line therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedures no longer recommended</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical treatment of SUI has evolved, particularly since the introduction of midurethral slings. Several procedures that were once widely used are now no longer recommended since there are more effective alternatives. Data regarding these procedures will be reviewed in this section. Choosing among procedures that are currently in use is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a procedure'</a> below.)</p><p>Retropubic colposuspension has generally been used as the reference standard for these procedures. This is because the procedures in this section precede the widespread use of suburethral slings, particularly midurethral slings. Thus, they can be compared with slings only indirectly, using data that show that the efficacy of midurethral sling placement is comparable to colposuspension. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Midurethral slings versus other procedures'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Anterior colporrhaphy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anterior colporrhaphy (even with Kelly-Kennedy plication) is not an effective approach to surgical treatment of SUI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. A meta-analysis of eight randomized trials found that the SUI treatment failure rate within one to five years was significantly higher after anterior repair compared with retropubic colposuspension (38 versus 17 percent; RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.7-3.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

There are few high quality data regarding use of paravaginal repair for women with SUI. A small randomized trial (n = 36) found that the success rate at one to three years was significantly lower following paravaginal repair compared with Burch colposuspension (72 versus 100 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. No difference was found in perioperative complications between the two procedures. In addition, observational studies have reported that paravaginal repair for treatment of SUI was associated with a 20 to 57 percent failure rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Transvaginal needle suspensions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transvaginal needle suspensions (eg, Raz, Stamey, or Gittes procedures) have largely been replaced by other procedures. These procedures are also referred to as needle urethropexy and consist of transvaginal placement of permanent sutures to attach the suburethral endopelvic fascia to the rectus fascia or pubic bone. A meta-analysis of 10 trials demonstrated a significantly higher SUI treatment failure rate at one-year postoperatively for needle suspension compared with retropubic colposuspension (29 versus 16 percent; RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.5-2.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

The two procedures vary by the site of attachment of the endopelvic fascia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Burch procedure, the endopelvic fascia adjacent to the mid and proximal urethra at the bladder neck is attached to the pectineal (Cooper's) ligaments on the posterior surface of the superior pubic ramus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76932%7EOBGYN%2F59261%7EOBGYN%2F56969\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76932 graphicRef59261 graphicRef56969 \">figure 2A-C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the MMK procedure, the endopelvic fascia next to the bladder neck is attached to the periosteum of the posterior pubic symphysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80731\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80731 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p>Burch appears to be more effective than MMK and also has a lower procedural morbidity. A meta-analysis of four randomized trials found that, at one- to five-year follow-up, the SUI treatment failure rate was lower for Burch compared with MMK (23 versus 34 percent; RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.52-0.99) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. This result had a wide confidence interval, and therefore does not strongly support the superiority of the Burch procedure. However, Burch has additional advantages compared with MMK, including: (1) duration of postoperative bladder catheterization is an average of six days shorter with Burch; (2) osteitis pubis occurs after 1 percent of MMK procedures, but not after Burch; (3) the pectineal ligament is a stronger supporting structure than the pubic periosteum; and (4) Burch corrects small anterior wall support defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/34,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,36,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOOSING A PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the introduction of midurethral slings in the 1990s, these procedures have become the procedure of choice for primary surgical treatment of SUI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].

This applies primarily to women with apical prolapse repaired using abdominal sacrocolpopexy. However, even in this population, many surgeons perform midurethral sling procedures, especially when using laparoscopic or robotically-assisted laparoscopic techniques.

In addition, two prospective cohort studies that followed women for 7 to 11 years after tension-free vaginal tape procedures (the first midurethral sling that was introduced) reported subjective cure rates of 77 to 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>The meta-analysis also noted the following findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The operative duration was significantly shorter for midurethral sling procedures by an average of 71, 15, and 25 minutes compared to bladder neck slings, open colposuspension, and laparoscopic colposuspension, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rate of most perioperative complications did not differ significantly across the procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The notable exception was perforation of the bladder or urethra, which occurred more frequently during midurethral sling surgery compared with open or laparoscopic colposuspension (4.7 versus 1.1 percent and 4.9 versus 1.7 percent); these data reflect mainly bladder perforation since urethral perforation is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. However, this finding does not greatly impact the choice of procedure, since bladder perforations associated with midurethral slings add little to patient recovery time (they are managed with a bladder catheter for a few days) and do not appear to have serious sequelae or affect SUI cure rates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings#H4700528\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in women: Retropubic midurethral slings&quot;, section on 'Bladder injury'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adverse effects on bladder function occurred with less or similar frequency in women who underwent midurethral sling procedures.

The difference is probably greater between midurethral slings and open colposuspension, since an open incision typically requires a longer recovery time than laparoscopic incisions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Midurethral slings appear to be more cost-effective than other procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p/><p>In summary, midurethral slings have comparable efficacy to other procedures but a shorter operative duration and recovery time. While most complication rates are similar across procedures, midurethral slings have a lower rate of de novo urinary urgency symptoms. The main disadvantage of midurethral slings is the risk of bladder perforation, but this complication is easily managed. Thus, we recommend midurethral sling placement for most healthy women with SUI who desire surgical treatment. A meta-analysis of 81 trials including over 12,000 women reported that over 80 percent of women with SUI are cured or have significant improvement in their symptoms for up to five years after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The two common procedures are the retropubic sling (sling insertion through the abdomen behind the pubic bone) or transobturator sling (sling insertion through the groin). Choosing among retropubic, transobturator, and the modified single incision slings is reviewed separately.

The merit of a vaginal versus an open abdominal approach for the treatment of apical prolapse remains a topic of debate among experts. Although data from randomized clinical trials show abdominal repairs to be more durable, vaginal repairs are associated with fewer complications and a faster recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].

Furthermore, an abdominal procedure avoids additional incisions and additional foreign body near the urinary tract.</p><p>Midurethral sling placement is preferable to Burch for most women, as discussed above. This has led some surgeons to perform an abdominal sacrocolpopexy combined with midurethral sling placement. Unfortunately, this combination of procedures limits some of the advantages of midurethral slings. Women who undergo this combination of procedures will not benefit from the usual shorter recovery period following transvaginal sling surgery. On the other hand, the midurethral sling vaginal incisions are minimal and unlikely to increase postoperative discomfort. Wound infection is rare following midurethral sling procedures (8 per 1000 procedures in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The remaining potential advantage of this approach is the finding in a meta-analysis of randomized trials that there may be a lower risk developing of urinary urgency symptoms after a midurethral sling compared with Burch (9 versus 12 percent), but this difference was not statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

ISD has historically been defined as a maximal urethral closure pressure &lt;20 cm H2O <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a Valsalva leak-point pressure &lt;60 cm H2O. These cut-offs are highly arbitrary and have been found to have limited predictive value in determining postoperative outcomes for primary SUI treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Studies have found that lack of urethral hypermobility and ISD are not necessarily a unified clinical entity since these issues co-exist in many, but not all, women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. The current understanding is that urethral sphincter function is compromised to some degree in all women with SUI.</p><p>In our practice, we no longer routinely test for urethral hypermobility (ie, with a cotton swab test) since the results do not impact the choice of a primary anti-incontinence procedure (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure#H1568119\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in women: Preoperative evaluation for a primary procedure&quot;, section on 'Assessing urethral mobility'</a>). Further, since ISD has been considered a urodynamic diagnosis and the clinical utility of routine urodynamic testing in women with uncomplicated SUI remains unknown, there is no rationale to support its routine assessment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in women: Preoperative evaluation for a primary procedure&quot;, section on 'Urodynamic testing'</a>.)</p><p>Women without urethral hypermobility may be successfully treated with a midurethral sling. There are few data regarding colposuspension in this population. Moreover, data are inconsistent regarding whether women with both ISD and a fixed urethra have a higher failure rate than women with ISD alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Some studies have reported that midurethral slings are less effective in women without urethral hypermobility, but in general, observational studies have found high success rates (approximately 70 to 80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/57,61-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,61-71</a>]. This appears comparable to long-term studies of midurethral slings, which have reported success rates of 77 to 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. As noted above, whether retropubic slings are more effective in women clinically suspected of having ISD than transobturator slings is under investigation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-persistent-recurrent-symptoms-after-surgical-treatment#H6172665\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress urinary incontinence in women: Persistent/recurrent symptoms after surgical treatment&quot;, section on 'Periurethral injection therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-type-of-midurethral-sling#H2822326\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in women: Choosing a type of midurethral sling&quot;, section on 'Transobturator versus retropubic midurethral slings'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical dilemma in women with a lack of urethral hypermobility <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> suspected ISD is whether it is possible to identify which women are likely to fail treatment with a sling or colposuspension. There are no comparative studies regarding outcomes of bulking agents and other anti-incontinence procedures. The reported success rate of periurethral bulking agents varies from 48 to 75 percent, which is similar to the success rates for midurethral slings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/4,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,57</a>].

As there is no data-proven optimum treatment order or combination, the patient and clinician weigh the risks of the various therapies, including the time and cost of behavioral therapy, the need for long-term use and possible side effects of medication, and risks of surgery. We typically offer behavioral and medical therapy as they are low-risk and may provide enough symptom relief to avoid the need for surgery. </p><p>For women whose symptoms are nearly all urgency-related (ie, SUI is minor component), we treat the UUI symptoms with behavioral therapy, medication, and neuromodulation (eg, posterior tibial nerve stimulation and sacral nerve modulation). For women who have predominantly SUI symptoms, difficulty obtaining or adhering to behavioral or medical therapy, or symptoms refractory to non-surgical therapy, we offer surgical treatment, typically with a midurethral sling. The presence of mixed incontinence does not influence the choice of sling. Sling choice is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-type-of-midurethral-sling#H68522039\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in women: Choosing a type of midurethral sling&quot;, section on 'Mixed urinary incontinence'</a>.)</p><p>Our rationale for offering SUI surgery to women with mixed incontinence is based on data suggesting that overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome and SUI may not be separate, unrelated conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>] and surgical outcome data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/76-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-78</a>]. As an example, a secondary analysis of three multicenter trials of women with mixed urinary incontinence who underwent one of four anti-SUI procedures (retropubic midurethral sling, transobturator midurethral sling, Burch colposuspension, or autologous pubofascial sling) reported that the majority of women (50 to 70 percent) in each group had reductions in OAB symptoms, including UUI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. The percent of women reporting symptom improvement was not different between the two midurethral sling groups (retropubic sling 66 percent and transobturator sling 71 percent). The Burch colposuspension group improved more than women undergoing a pubovaginal sling (68 percent versus 57 percent). These findings contrast with prior studies that suggested worsening of UUI symptoms after midurethral and pubofascial bladder neck slings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>]. However, the studies that suggested worsening of UUI symptoms were smaller cohort studies and included only women being treated for SUI, not mixed urinary incontinence.</p><p>While SUI surgery reduces mixed incontinence symptoms, it is less successful at resolving incontinence in women with mixed urinary incontinence compared with women with SUI only. In a 2011 systematic review and meta-analysis of six randomized trials and seven prospective studies that assessed the outcome of midurethral sling surgery, women with mixed incontinence had lower cure rates compared with women with only SUI (56 percent versus 85 to 97 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Similarly, a subsequent cohort study of over 1000 women who underwent a midurethral sling procedure reported lower incontinence cure rates for women with mixed incontinence compared with women with SUI only (64 versus 85 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. </p><p>Because there are less data on the Burch colposuspension in women with mixed incontinence and the surgery is more invasive, midurethral slings are generally preferred for these women. However, Burch colposuspension may be indicated to treat mixed urinary incontinence in women having other abdominal procedures. In one prospective study of 40 women who underwent Burch colposuspension, women with mixed incontinence had no significant difference in the overall incontinence cure rate compared with women with SUI only (87 versus 80 percent) at six months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. In addition, Burch colposuspension may be associated with less UUI compared with traditional bladder neck slings. In a follow-up study of surgery for SUI-predominant mixed urinary incontinence, postoperative UUI was less likely in women undergoing Burch colposuspension than in women undergoing bladder neck sling procedures (29 versus 41 percent) six weeks from surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

A case-control study reporting outcomes in 83 women who had retropubic mid-urethral sling surgery detected no significant difference in 18-month continence rates between obese (body mass index [BMI] &gt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> and non-obese (BMI &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> women (87 versus 92 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].

Trials of alternate surgical procedures have also reported treatment efficacy in obese women. In a trial of nearly 550 women randomly assigned to Burch colposuspension or rectus fascial sling for the primary treatment of stress predominant urinary incontinence, BMI was not associated with treatment failure at 24 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. </p><p>While incontinence surgery appears to be effective in obese women, weight loss is also associated with a significant reduction in the number of incontinence episodes and does not entail the risks of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].

As an example, two cohort studies totaling over 1500 women that assessed midurethral sling outcome by age group reported no difference in stress urinary incontinence failure rates or complication rates between older (mean age 75 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>] and 85 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>] years) and younger women (mean age 56 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>] and 58 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>] years). In both studies, the older women reported more persistent urgency urinary incontinence symptoms compared with younger women (32 versus 23 percent, respectively). We counsel women &ge;70 years who are preparing for midurethral sling surgery that their urgency incontinence symptoms are more likely to persist postoperatively compared with younger women, but the surgical efficacy for stress urinary incontinence is the same.</p><p>A validated risk calculator has been developed to calculate individual predicted risks of bothersome SUI, bothersome urgency urinary incontinence, positive stress test, and adverse events 12 months after midurethral sling surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F103962\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103962 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p>Women with SUI who cannot tolerate, or decline, surgery and have failed conservative therapy are candidates for injection of periurethral bulking agents. The overall reported success rate of periurethral bulking agents is 48 to 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/4,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,57</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H563649221\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical treatment of SUI is best avoided in women who plan future childbearing. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Women finished with childbearing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A vaginal or abdominal approach can be used for surgical treatment of SUI. Vaginal procedures include: midurethral sling, bladder neck sling, or injection of urethral bulking agents. Burch retropubic colposuspension is an abdominal procedure for SUI. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Types of procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most healthy women with SUI who desire surgical treatment and accept synthetic surgical materials, we recommend midurethral sling placement rather than Burch colposuspension or bladder neck sling (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Procedures that are clearly less effective than midurethral slings are: anterior colporrhaphy (even with Kelly-Kennedy plication), transabdominal paravaginal repair, and transvaginal needle suspension. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Midurethral slings versus other procedures'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Procedures no longer recommended'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with SUI who are undergoing open abdominal sacrocolpopexy, we suggest retropubic colposuspension rather than midurethral sling placement (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For women undergoing retropubic colposuspension, we suggest the Burch rather than Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz procedure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Apical prolapse'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Procedures no longer recommended'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who decline or cannot tolerate surgery, but have failed conservative therapy, we suggest injection of periurethral bulking agents (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
