Also called oculosympathetic paresis, a Horner syndrome can be produced by a lesion anywhere along the sympathetic pathway that supplies the head, eye, and neck. Causes range from benign to serious, requiring a methodological approach to diagnostic evaluation. The differential diagnosis also differs in children and adults, leading to differences in the diagnostic approach.</p><p>This topic reviews Horner syndrome. Other causes of anisocoria and ptosis are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-anisocoria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with anisocoria&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-ptosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of ptosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Horner syndrome can result from a lesion anywhere along a three-neuron sympathetic (adrenergic) pathway that originates in the hypothalamus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62879\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62879 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first-order neuron descends caudally from the hypothalamus to the first synapse, which is located in the cervical spinal cord (levels C8-T2, also called ciliospinal center of Budge).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second-order neuron travels from the sympathetic trunk, through the brachial plexus, over the lung apex. It then ascends to the superior cervical ganglion, located near the angle of the mandible and the bifurcation of the common carotid artery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The third-order neuron then ascends within the adventitia of the internal carotid artery, through the cavernous sinus, where it is in close relation to the sixth cranial nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The oculosympathetic pathway then joins the ophthalmic (V1) division of the fifth cranial nerve (trigeminal nerve). In the orbit and the eye, the oculosympathetic fibers innervate the iris dilator muscle as well as M&uuml;ller's muscle, a small smooth muscle in the eyelids responsible for a minor portion of the upper lid elevation and lower lid retraction.</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic signs of a Horner syndrome are ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F54798\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54798 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F67538\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67538 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The degree of anisocoria is more marked in the dark than in light. There is associated dilation lag, an asymmetry in pupillary redilation between the two eyes when the light source is moved away from the eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The Horner pupil will redilate more slowly (by 15 to 20 seconds) than the normal pupil.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ptosis is minor (less than 2 mm) and occurs as a result of paralysis of the M&uuml;ller's muscle, which is innervated by the sympathetic pathway. The lower as well as the upper lid is affected, producing the so-called &quot;upside-down ptosis.&quot; This further narrows the palpebral fissure. The levator palpebrae superioris is unaffected; weakness of this muscle produces the more profound upper lid ptosis seen in third cranial nerve palsies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anhidrosis is present in central or preganglionic (first or second-order) lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62879\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62879 \">figure 1</a>). The sympathetic fibers responsible for facial sweating and vasodilation branch off at the superior cervical ganglion from the remainder of the oculosympathetic pathway; thus, anhidrosis is not a feature of postganglionic or third-order lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This sign is frequently not apparent to patients or clinicians.</p><p/><p>In infants and children, impaired facial flushing (Harlequin sign) is often more apparent than anhidrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Acute features of sympathetic disruption can also include ipsilateral conjunctival injection, nasal stuffiness, and increased near point of accommodation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>A congenital Horner syndrome should be suspected when anisocoria is associated with heterochromia (unequal iris color, with the affected iris being lighter). This occurs because formation of iris pigment in the first several months of age is under sympathetic control. This may only be apparent if the natural color is relatively dark.</p><p>Associated neurologic symptoms and signs can be useful in localizing the origin of the Horner syndrome:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brainstem signs (diplopia, vertigo, ataxia, lateralized weakness) suggest a brainstem localization</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myelopathic features (bilateral or ipsilateral weakness, long tract signs, sensory level, bowel and bladder impairment) suggest involvement of the cervicothoracic cord.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arm pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hand weakness typical of brachial plexus lesions suggest a lesion in the lung apex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ipsilateral extraocular pareses, particularly a sixth nerve palsy, in the absence of other brainstem signs localize the lesion to the cavernous sinus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An isolated Horner syndrome accompanied by neck or head pain suggests an internal carotid dissection.</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of Horner syndrome in adults relates to the lesion location (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61280\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61280 \">table 1</a>). In one large case series, 40 percent of cases of Horner syndrome had an unknown diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the remaining 270 patients, 13 percent were related to a first-order (central) lesion, 44 percent to a second-order (preganglionic) lesion, and 43 percent to a third-order (postganglionic) lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">First-order syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lesions of the sympathetic tracts in the brainstem or cervicothoracic spinal cord can produce a first-order Horner syndrome.</p><p>The most common cause is a lateral medullary infarction, which produces a Horner syndrome as part of the Wallenberg syndrome. Typically the patient presents with vertigo and ataxia, which overshadow the Horner syndrome. Other neurologic symptoms and signs include abnormal eye movements, ipsilateral limb ataxia, and a dissociated sensory loss (loss of pain and temperature sensation on the ipsilateral face and contralateral trunk). Hoarseness and dysphagia are also often present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posterior-circulation-cerebrovascular-syndromes#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posterior circulation cerebrovascular syndromes&quot;, section on 'Lateral medullary infarction'</a>.)</p><p>Strokes, tumors, and demyelinating lesions affecting the sympathetic tracts in the hypothalamus, midbrain, pons, medulla, or cervicothoracic spinal cord are other potential causes of a central Horner syndrome. Syringomyelia and cervical cord trauma can also produce a Horner syndrome when the intermediolateral columns are affected.</p><p>These central nervous system lesions are usually associated with other neurologic signs and symptoms such as weakness, sensory deficit, homonymous hemianopia, diplopia, or ataxia. Similarly, myelopathic features (unilateral or bilateral long tract signs, sensory level) indicate a lesion in the cervical or thoracic spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Second-order syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Second-order or preganglionic Horner syndromes can occur with trauma or surgery involving the spinal cord, thoracic outlet, or lung apex. Other cases are related to malignancy, which can be occult at the time of presentation with the Horner syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Ipsilateral axillary or arm pain often accompanies the Horner syndrome in these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Lumbar epidural anesthesia can also produce a Horner syndrome due to pharmacologic disruption of the preganglionic neuron as it exits the spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This is most often described in association with obstetrical procedures; in such cases, a Horner syndrome may indicate high sympathetic blockade. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adverse-effects-of-neuraxial-analgesia-and-anesthesia-for-obstetrics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adverse effects of neuraxial analgesia and anesthesia for obstetrics&quot;</a>.).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Third-order syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Third-order Horner syndromes often indicate lesions of the internal carotid artery such as an arterial dissection, thrombosis, or cavernous sinus aneurysm. Carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting can also produce a Horner syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-carotid-endarterectomy#H101624770\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of carotid endarterectomy&quot;, section on 'Nerve injury'</a>.)</p><p>An acute Horner syndrome with neck or facial pain should be presumed to be caused by carotid dissection until proven otherwise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Between 25 and 60 percent of patients with internal carotid artery dissections present with an isolated painful third-order Horner syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Patients often have an antecedent history of neck trauma, but this can be subtle, and a number of carotid dissections are spontaneous events. Patients with acute carotid dissection are at a high risk for cerebral infarction, which usually occurs within the first few weeks, often within days, after onset of the Horner syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Emergent diagnostic tests should be obtained (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> below). Carotid dissection is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous cerebral and cervical artery dissection: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other causes of postganglionic Horner syndrome include neck masses, otitis media, and pathology involving the cavernous sinus. Abnormalities of eye movements, particularly a sixth nerve palsy, commonly occur when the cavernous sinus is involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>A Horner syndrome is a common feature of cluster headache, occurring with unilateral eye or temple pain and lacrimation, generally lasting no more than an hour or two [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cluster headache: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of Horner syndrome in infants and children differs from the adult population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69658\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69658 \">table 2</a>). Classic causes include birth trauma, neuroblastoma, vascular anomalies of the large arteries, and chest surgery.</p><p>The most common cause is delivery-related trauma to the neck and shoulder, damaging the sympathetic pathway. Associated injury to the lower brachial plexus can produce weakness in the ipsilateral forearm and hand (Klumpke's paralysis).</p><p>In the absence of a clear history of birth trauma, an acquired Horner syndrome in a child should prompt evaluation for a tumor, particularly a paraspinal neuroblastoma, which is known to present with a Horner syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. Testing will often include imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, neck, chest, and abdomen, as well as measurement of urinary catecholamines.

In this setting, pharmacologic testing would only delay appropriate testing and management. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a patient presents to an outpatient clinic with incidentally found isolated anisocoria, confirming the Horner syndrome before obtaining potentially costly and unnecessary tests is helpful. Unlike cocaine drops, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apraclonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apraclonidine</a> drops are readily available, and are a very reliable way to confirm (or to rule-out) a Horner syndrome in adults or even older children. </p><p/><p>However, localization of the lesion along the sympathetic pathway with hydroxyamphetamine is much less often done, and many experts do not recommend its routine use prior to obtaining the work-up of a confirmed Horner syndrome. The test is poorly reliable in children and the difficulty in obtaining such drops limits its use to very specialized centers in most cases. Additionally, it cannot be performed on the same day as the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apraclonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apraclonidine</a> test, making it necessary for the patient to come back a few days later. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Confirmation of Horner syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacological testing with cocaine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apraclonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apraclonidine</a> drops can confirm the diagnosis of Horner syndrome in subtle cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. This can also be used to distinguish a Horner syndrome from a pseudo-Horner syndrome due to physiologic anisocoria in the setting of mild eyelid asymmetry or aponeurotic ptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. If the diagnosis of Horner syndrome is clear clinically, then use of cocaine or apraclonidine drops to confirm the diagnosis can be avoided, as their administration will interfere with the hydroxyamphetamine test for localization.</p><p>Cocaine blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine at the sympathetic nerve synapse and causes pupillary dilation in eyes with intact sympathetic innervation. Cocaine has no effect in eyes with impaired sympathetic innervation, regardless of the lesion location. One hour after instillation of two drops of cocaine (4 or 10 percent), a normal pupil dilates more than the Horner pupil, increasing the degree of anisocoria; anisocoria of 1 mm or more after cocaine administration is considered a positive result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=apraclonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Apraclonidine</a>, a direct alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist, has been proposed as an alternative to cocaine in confirming the diagnosis of Horner syndrome. Apraclonidine has weak alpha-1 and strong alpha-2 activity; the former mediates pupillary dilation, while the latter downregulates norepinephrine release at the neuromuscular junction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In a Horner pupil, denervation supersensitivity to the alpha-1 receptor will cause that pupil to dilate (usually by about 2 mm), while alpha-2 stimulation in the normal eye will cause that pupil to constrict slightly (usually by &lt;1 mm). Thus, one to two drops of 0.5 percent apraclonidine instilled in both eyes causes a reversal of anisocoria in patients with Horner syndrome. Comparison testing in small series of patients suggests that this test compares favorably with cocaine in the diagnosis of Horner syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Localization of the lesion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyamphetamine-and-tropicamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hydroxyamphetamine eye drops</a> will differentiate between a lesion affecting the first (brainstem or cervical cord) or second-order (chest or neck) neuron and one affecting the third-order or postganglionic neuron (above the superior cervical ganglion at the carotid bifurcation). There is no pharmacologic test to distinguish between first and second-order lesions. Because cocaine may interfere with the uptake and efficacy of hydroxyamphetamine drops, it is recommended that 24 to 72 hours elapse between the two tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Hydroxyamphetamine releases stored norepinephrine from the postganglionic adrenergic nerve endings. One hour after instillation of 1 percent hydroxyamphetamine, a normal pupil and a first or second-order Horner pupil will dilate, whereas a third-order Horner pupil will not dilate as well as the normal pupil (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F67538\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67538 \">picture 2</a>). The test is positive for postganglionic Horner lesions when the anisocoria increases by at least 1 mm. This test has a sensitivity of 93 to 96 percent and a specificity of 84 percent for detecting postganglionic lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/6,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,33,34</a>]. This test is not reliable in children in whom transynaptic degeneration occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>An alternative to hydroxyamphetamine is its derivative, pholedrine, which may be more available than hydroxyamphetamine in some locations. The test using 1 percent pholedrine is performed in the same manner as with hydroxyamphetamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While many cases of Horner syndrome have no identified etiology even after extensive investigation, the possibility of a life-threatening condition dictates that some evaluation take place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/horner-syndrome/abstract/6,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,36</a>].
