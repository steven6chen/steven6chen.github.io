Heart block in children can be mild or serious. Mild types of heart block can cause a child's heart to beat more slowly than normal or to skip beats. More serious types can cause a child's heart to stop beating. Without emergency treatment, serious heart block can be fatal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4618270\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes heart block in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heart block happens when the electrical signals that tell the heart to beat either get slowed slow down or stopped. This can be caused by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A problem with the heart that happened before the child was born &ndash; These heart problems are called &quot;congenital heart defects.&quot; Congenital means a condition a person is born with.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An autoimmune disease called &quot;neonatal lupus&quot; &ndash; This can happen when a mother has a certain type of antibodies (proteins in the blood) that are passed on to the baby.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery for another congenital heart defect</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other heart problems, diseases, or injuries</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4618287\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of heart block?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms depend on the type of heart block your child has. There are 3 types of heart block:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First degree &ndash; This is the mildest type of heart block. Often, children with this type have no symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second degree &ndash; This type is more serious than first degree. Children with second degree heart block might or might not have symptoms. Symptoms can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fainting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Feeling dizzy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Feeling tired</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Third degree &ndash; This is the most serious type of heart block. It can cause the same symptoms as second degree, but they will be more severe. Third degree heart block can be life-threatening.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4618302\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your child will have 1 or both of these tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Holter monitor &ndash; This is a small, portable machine the child wears that records all the heart's electrical activity over 1 or 2 days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An echocardiogram &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create a picture of the heart as it beats. It might be used if your child has a history of passing out, or if the ECG or Holter monitor testing are abnormal. It checks to see if there are any structural heart problems (congenital heart defects) and it tests how well the heart is pumping.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4618317\"><span class=\"h1\">How is heart block treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment depends on the type of heart block your child has and his or her symptoms. Often, children who have first degree heart block do not need treatment. But children who have third degree heart block and some who have second degree heart block need a pacemaker. A pacemaker is a device that goes under the skin near the heart. It sends electrical signals to the heart that help it beat normally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4618332\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacemakers-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pacemakers (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
