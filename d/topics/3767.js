As such, seizures may indicate the presence of a potentially treatable etiology and should prompt an immediate evaluation to determine cause and to institute etiology-specific therapy. In addition, seizures themselves may require emergent therapy, since they may adversely affect the infant's homeostasis or they can contribute to further brain injury.</p><p>The clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of neonatal seizures will be reviewed here. The etiology and treatment of neonatal seizures and associated epileptic syndromes are discussed separately.

Reported incidence ranges from 1.5 to 5.5 per 1000 in newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>] and may be even higher in premature infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Seizure incidence varies with some specific risk factors. Occurrence increases with decreasing gestational age and birth weight, and with increasing acuity of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/2,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530064519\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most neonatal seizures (approximately 85 percent) are &quot;symptomatic&quot; seizures, occurring as a consequence of a specific identifiable etiology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73867\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73867 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76726\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76726 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. These etiologies can be broadly categorized as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal encephalopathy and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Structural brain injuries, including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic disturbances (most often glucose and electrolyte abnormalities)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CNS or systemic infections</p><p/><p>Epilepsy syndromes make up about 15 percent of all neonatal seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In well-appearing neonates with a negative work up, recurrent neonatal seizures may be due to a genetic epilepsy syndrome such as benign familial neonatal epilepsy. In contrast, severe neonatal epilepsy syndromes such as early (neonatal) myoclonic encephalopathy (EME) and early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) are associated with an abnormal exam and a poor prognosis.</p><p>The etiology and prognosis of neonatal seizures and neonatal epilepsy syndromes are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-prognosis-of-neonatal-seizures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and prognosis of neonatal seizures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal epilepsy syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530064758\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seizures in the neonate have unique clinical features when compared with those of older infants and children. There are age-dependent properties of the immature brain that enhance seizure initiation, maintenance of the seizure discharge, and propagation of the seizure discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The clinical events that are most consistently due to neonatal seizures are focal-clonic, focal-tonic, some types of myoclonic, and epileptic spasms. Non-seizure paroxysmal events are common in this age group and can sometimes be difficult to distinguish from seizures. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>There have been a number of clinical classifications of neonatal seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/16-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-23</a>]. These mainly classify seizures according to their motor manifestations (focal clonic, multifocal clonic, generalized tonic, myoclonic, and subtle). The &lsquo;subtle&rsquo; semiology refers to seizures with signs such as abnormal eye movements, lip smacking, swimming or pedaling movements, or apnea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59395\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59395 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61962\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61962 \">table 4</a>). Neonatal seizures remain distinct entities according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) seizure classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical seizure types</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A typical electroclinical neonatal seizure is a sequence of clinical events that may include different movements or behaviors that may occur at different times within the same seizure. Importantly, neonatal seizures are not generalized but focal (either unifocal or multifocal).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Focal clonic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Focal-clonic seizures consist of repetitive, rhythmic contractions of specific muscle groups of the limbs, face, or trunk. Clonic movements typically have a slow rate of repetition, particularly when larger muscle groups are involved. They have a close relationship to the EEG seizure pattern, with each contraction having a consistent, time-locked relationship to EEG seizure discharges.</p><p>Compared with non-seizure movements such as clonus or tremor, the jerking movements of a focal-clonic seizure are consistently slower and more rhythmic. Focal-clonic seizures can be differentiated from tremor or clonus by restraint of movement. Tremor or clonus can be stopped by restraint, though clonic seizure activity cannot, and muscle twitching can still be felt in the restrained limb.</p><p>While focal-clonic seizures may be the most easily recognized by observers, these events do have features that may be unique to the neonatal period. Focal-clonic seizures may be unifocal, confined to specific muscle groups including those of the proximal or distal limbs, trunk or neck, or regions of the face. Focal seizures may alternate between sites of involvement within the same seizure. Focal seizures may be multifocal and may exhibit clonic activity simultaneously but asynchronously. If all four limbs are involved, this may give the appearance of a generalized seizure. However, more careful inspection reveals that the limbs are not moving synchronously.</p><p>Focal seizures can migrate from one region to another. Migration may be according to traditional Jacksonian features (ie, contiguous spread over the cortical representation of the limbs, face and trunk) or may be more erratic in spread. Focal seizures may also be hemiconvulsive. In this regard, a seizure may be initially confined to the hand on one side of the body and then abruptly involve the remainder of that side of body without an intervening Jacksonian march.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Focal tonic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Focal tonic seizures occur less often than focal clonic seizures. Focal tonic seizures are characterized by sustained, but transient, asymmetrical posturing of the trunk or extremities or tonic deviation of the eyes. Seizures involving the limbs or trunk may appear as unilateral flexion of the trunk with the body pulling down and to one side or sustained flexion or extension of a limb. When the eyes are involved, there is sustained conjugate deviation of the eyes to one side. Any of these events are typically associated with focal EEG seizure activity.</p><p>Tonic seizures are the hallmark of several neonatal epilepsy syndromes (eg, Ohtahara syndrome, KCNQ2 encephalopathy). Therefore, prominent focal tonic semiology should trigger consideration of neonatal-onset epilepsy as the etiology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal epilepsy syndromes&quot;, section on 'Severe syndromes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Myoclonic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myoclonic seizures in neonates represent a diverse range of movements, some epileptic in origin and some nonepileptic in origin. The movements of myoclonic seizures are characterized by contractions of muscle groups of well-defined regions: proximal or distal limb regions, entire limbs, trunk or diaphragm, or face. The movements are of variable speed depending upon the size of the muscle group involved. The movements may be isolated events or may be repetitive; when repetitive the rate of recurrence may be slow, irregular, or erratic.</p><p>Myoclonic events are distinguished from clonic seizures by the regular rate of repetition and persistence of clonic events. Myoclonic seizures can be classified as focal, generalized, or fragmentary. Focal myoclonic seizures have features similar to focal clonic seizures except that myoclonic events are nonrepetitive and erratic. Generalized myoclonic seizures include bilateral, symmetric jerking of all extremities <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> muscles of the trunk and neck. Fragmentary myoclonus is characterized by rapid, simultaneous but asynchronous, twitching of various small muscle groups that are typically distal. Fragmentary myoclonus is typically nonepileptic in origin.</p><p>Some forms of myoclonic seizures may occur with a consistent EEG seizure discharge, although some do not. This reflects the fact that some myoclonic seizures are generated at a cortical level and others are generated at more caudal levels such as subcortical structures, brainstem, spinal cord, or neuromuscular junction. In addition, some myoclonic seizures may be provoked by stimulation and suppressed by limb restraint or body repositioning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Epileptic spasms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epileptic spasms may occur in neonates, although they are rare. Spasms primarily involve truncal muscles and limbs. They are flexor, extensor, or mixed flexor-extensor. The clinical appearance of the events may be affected by the body position of the neonate at the time of the seizure. The spasm begins with an initial muscle contraction that is transiently maintained, followed by relaxation of the muscle.</p><p>The seizures may occur in clusters and are most often present upon arousal of the infant from sleep. On EEG, the seizures may be associated with a generalized, high voltage, slow wave transient or generalized voltage attenuation. Spasms are considered electroclinical seizures and are epileptic in origin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-infantile-spasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of infantile spasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Autonomic signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical changes related to the autonomic nervous system have been reported to be manifestations of neonatal seizures. These changes include: alterations in heart rate, respiration and blood pressure, flushing, salivation, and pupil dilatation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/21,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25,26</a>]. However, the occurrence of any of these findings in isolation as true electrographic seizures is rare. When they do occur, they do so most consistently in association with other clinical motor manifestations of seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/18,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,27</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H530066660\" class=\"local\">'Abrupt changes in vital signs'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15838532\"><span class=\"h2\">Subclinical seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most neonatal seizures have no overt clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/13,28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,28-32</a>]. A preverbal infant cannot communicate sensory phenomena associated with seizures (eg, a visual change associated with an occipital seizure or a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu due to a temporal lobe seizure), and unless the seizure originates in, or migrates to, the motor cortex, there will generally not be a clear abnormal movement. In a single-center review of 400 continuous video EEG studies performed in critically ill neonates, electrographic seizures were captured in 26 percent of monitored patients, and 24 percent of seizures had no clinical correlate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Others have reported much higher rates of subclinical seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seizures in the neonate can be difficult to distinguish from abnormal, non-seizure paroxysmal events or normal newborn behaviors, and EEG is often required to distinguish among them. As demonstrated by the following studies, bedside clinical observation is inadequate for accurate neonatal seizure diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/18,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,34,35</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurses and physicians were trained to record every suspected seizure event for a sample of high-risk neonates who were undergoing conventional EEG recording. Just 9 percent (48 of 526) of all EEG-confirmed seizures had clinical manifestations that were noted in the bedside logs, while 78 percent (129 of 177) of the abnormal paroxysmal events documented by NICU clinicians had no EEG correlate (ie, the documented events were not seizures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, 137 nurses and doctors reviewed video recordings of electroclinical seizures (EEG-confirmed seizures that had definite clinical manifestations) and non-seizure events (clinically-apparent events that had no corresponding EEG change) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Interobserver agreement was poor (multi-rater kappa 0.21-0.29), and although two-thirds of clonic seizures were correctly diagnosed, only one third of seizures with other semiologies were accurately identified. Importantly, less than half of non-seizure events (eg, non-seizure clonus, benign sleep myoclonus, and other non-specific movements) were classified correctly.</p><p/><p>Inaccurate neonatal seizure diagnosis has important consequences. Neonates with subclinical seizures are undertreated without EEG screening, while those whose paroxysmal events are not seizures may be exposed to unnecessary medications. (See <a href=\"#H15837841\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530064810\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-seizure events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal seizures are generated by hypersynchronous cortical neuronal discharges. They are defined by their EEG patterns and may be electroclinical or subclinical. When infants are examined while they are experiencing electroclinical seizures, such as focal-clonic or focal-tonic seizures, the clinical event cannot be suppressed by restraint or repositioning of the affected limb. In addition, between seizures, clinical events cannot be provoked by stimulation of the infant.</p><p>In contrast, non&ndash;seizure events occur in the absence of any EEG change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/1,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18</a>]. They can sometimes be provoked by stimulation of the infant, and both the provoked and spontaneous events can typically be suppressed by restraint of the infant or by repositioning the infant during the event. In addition, the clinical events may increase in intensity with the increase in the repetition rate of stimulation (temporal summation) or the sites of simultaneous stimulation (spatial summation).</p><p>Examples of non-seizure neonatal events include various motor automatisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61962\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61962 \">table 4</a>) and tonic posturing. Like epileptic seizures, non-seizure paroxysmal events in the neonate are often symptomatic of underlying nervous system pathology and should be evaluated just as systematically as epileptic seizures.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor automatisms &ndash; The term &quot;motor automatisms&quot; is used to characterize clinical events referred to by some as &quot;subtle seizures.&quot; Although these events are sometimes electroclinical seizures, most often they are not (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61962\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61962 \">table 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Motor automatisms can often be provoked by stimulation and are considered a manifestation of brainstem release phenomena. Unless they have associated EEG correlates, they are not seizures. Motor automatisms may appear as oral-buccal-lingual movements including episodic chewing, swallowing, sucking, or repetitive tongue movements. Ocular movements appear as episodic random or oscillatory eye movements, repetitive eye opening, episodic and nonsustained eye deviation, or episodic dysconjugate gaze. Progression movements resemble pedaling or bicycling movements of the legs, swimming-like movements, rotary movement of the upper extremities, or combinations of these movements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tonic posturing &ndash; Bilateral, symmetric tonic posturing may be predominantly flexor, extensor, or mixed. The tonic posture is sustained and may involve bilateral limbs and the trunk. The muscle contractions are relatively long and are of greater duration than spasms. These tonic events can be provoked by stimulation and suppressed by restraint or repositioning of the infant. These events may occur in isolation, or they may occur in infants who are also experiencing motor automatisms.</p><p/><p>Both tonic posturing and motor automatisms are considered to be of nonepileptic origin if they have no associated ictal rhythm on EEG. They have clinical features that resemble exaggerated reflex behavior. They occur in infants who are obtunded or lethargic and with EEG background characterized as depressed and undifferentiated, features indicating the presence of forebrain depression. Tactile stimulation of the infants may provoke posturing or motor automatisms. These characteristics are based in reflex physiology and the events have been referred to as &quot;brainstem release phenomena&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/1,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18</a>].</p><p>Other paroxysmal events in the neonate that can be confused with seizures include hyperekplexia, jitteriness, tremulousness, and clonus. Such events can occur in normal and abnormal infants and can be differentiated from other clinical events, particularly focal-clonic seizures, by their suppression by restraint. The clinical phenomenology of these nonepileptic paroxysmal events, especially in relation to how they are distinguished from epileptic seizures, is discussed separately. Importantly, clinicians have been shown to be inaccurate in distinguishing non-seizure paroxysmal events from electroclinical seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in infancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530064816\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal newborn behaviors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal seizures must be differentiated from normal, non-seizure behaviors of the newborn. Some normal behaviors of preterm and full-term infants may raise suspicions of seizures. Normal behaviors include stretching, nonspecific random movements that can be sudden (particularly in preterm infants), random sucking movements, coughing, and gagging.</p><p>In addition, neonates may experience normal physiologic myoclonus during active sleep (the precursor of rapid eye movement [REM] sleep). Myoclonus may also occur during quiet or non-REM sleep and has been referred to as benign neonatal myoclonus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Importantly, if the neonate is otherwise healthy, the myoclonus virtually always ceases when the infant is awoken, and it only occurs when the neonate is asleep. This may help to distinguish this common phenomenon from neonatal seizures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in infancy&quot;, section on 'Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530066660\"><span class=\"h2\">Abrupt changes in vital signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most abrupt changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and respirations recorded in infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are not manifestations of seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/27,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29</a>]. When changes in these parameters are manifestations of seizures, they most often occur in association with motor phenomena or other clinical manifestations of seizures.</p><p>This was illustrated by a retrospective study of 324 continuous video EEG studies performed for the evaluation of paroxysmal vital sign changes in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Most of the studies were performed in neonates and infants less than one year old, and an index event was captured in 52 percent of the studies. The recorded vital sign changes were rarely related to seizures when the change was hypotension (0 out of 12), hypertension (1 out of 22, 4.5 percent), or bradycardia (2 out of 26, 7.7 percent), and all seizures were associated with additional clinical signs. Vital sign changes were more likely to be ictal when the change included oxygen desaturation (11 out of 82, 13 percent) or apnea (22 out of 83, 27 percent), particularly when accompanied by abnormal eye movements or an abrupt decrease in tone. Tachycardia with or without additional clinical signs was a seizure manifestation in 2 out of 23 studies (9 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15837841\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, the diagnosis of neonatal seizures was most often made based on clinical signs. However, modern electroencephalography (EEG) studies have demonstrated that not all clinically suspicious events are epileptic seizures (in fact, most are not), and most neonatal seizures are subclinical.</p><p>Contemporary diagnosis of neonatal seizures therefore relies on confirmatory electroencephalographic (EEG) characteristics. When at-risk infants undergo EEG monitoring, high rates of both false positive and false negative clinical diagnoses are demonstrated (27 and 81 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>A neonatal seizure is defined as a definitely abnormal EEG pattern which evolves (ie, the abnormal EEG waveform changes morphology, or the location migrates across head regions), is of &gt;2 microvolt (&micro;V) amplitude, and has a duration of &ge;10 seconds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Since this testing is specialized and resource-intensive, it should be reserved for newborns at highest risk for seizures. There are many examples of high-risk clinical scenarios, but in general EEG monitoring should be considered for newborns with proven or suspected acute brain injury <strong>and </strong>comorbid encephalopathy.</p><p>A routine-length, 60-minute EEG is not considered sufficient to screen for neonatal seizures. For newborns at high risk of seizures, the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society recommends that video EEG monitoring be recorded for 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In a prospective study of 426 consecutive neonates with clinically suspected seizures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> electrographic seizures who underwent EEG monitoring (82 percent with confirmed electrographic seizures), the median time to electrographic seizure detection was seven hours from the onset of the recording [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>If the interictal background is stable and no seizures are recorded after 24 hours, then monitoring may be discontinued. An exception is often made for neonates treated with therapeutic hypothermia for hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). These infants are frequently monitored throughout cooling and rewarming due to the high incidence of seizures in this patient population (about 50 percent will have neonatal seizures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p>If seizures are identified, EEG monitoring should continue until the infant is seizure-free for 24 hours, unless this duration of monitoring is not in the infant&rsquo;s best interests (eg, a newborn with seizures due to a severe brain malformation might not be expected to gain complete seizure control). Similarly, the guidelines specify that transfer to a different intensive care facility, solely for the purposes of EEG monitoring, might not always be in the infant&rsquo;s best interest and should be considered on a case-by-case basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>If EEG monitoring is initiated in order to evaluate whether discrete, abnormal paroxysmal events are seizures, then recording should continue until several events are captured. If the events are determined not to be seizures, then monitoring for that purpose may be discontinued.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15837997\"><span class=\"h2\">Serial routine-length EEGs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When video-EEG monitoring is unavailable, routine-length EEG recording with simultaneous observation by clinicians or EEG technologists trained in the recognition and characterization of neonatal seizures remains the standard of care and can provide clinically important information.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15838395\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduced-montage EEG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another option is the limited-channel digital bedside EEG, which combines amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) with 1 or 2-channel EEG. aEEG should not be considered equivalent to conventional multi-channel video EEG, but it can be a useful adjuvant tool when video-EEG is not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>While this technique is increasingly used in both term and preterm infants, there are important limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Not all electrographic seizures are detected by this modality because of limited coverage of the scalp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], low amplitudes, and slow frequency of typical seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In addition, artifact in these unattended recordings with no simultaneous video recording can cause false-positive interpretations. The reported sensitivity and specificity varies between 25 and 80 percent, in part depending upon the experience of the reader [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>] and the use of 1 versus 2-channel aEEG and the associated raw EEG tracings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>].</p><p>Despite these limitations, when standard EEG or continuous standard EEG recordings are not readily available, aEEG can be a useful tool; one study found that the use of aEEG improved clinical decision making and resulted in fewer neonates treated for seizures based solely on clinical findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>The development of automated seizure detection systems holds promise for better and more widely available EEG monitoring in the future, but current systems are not currently sufficiently reliable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/41,50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,50-52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530063767\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a diagnosis of neonatal seizures is being entertained, an expedited evaluation for the etiology is warranted.

Some infants may present with isolated seizures, however. Seizure characteristics that may suggest an underlying metabolic defect include myoclonic seizure semiology and seizures that are refractory to conventional treatment.

Signs and symptoms of systemic and central nervous system (CNS) infection can be subtle and nonspecific in newborns. If infection is suspected, appropriate cultures should be drawn and treatment initiated, including antibiotics at meningeal doses and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acyclovir</a> for herpes simplex virus in the appropriate clinical scenario.</p><p>Lumbar puncture is recommended in all neonates with a positive blood culture and should also be considered whenever there is clinical suspicion for sepsis, since clinical signs of CNS infection can be lacking in young infants and infection is among the most common causes of neonatal seizures.

In addition to routine sequences, MR angiography should be obtained if arterial ischemic stroke or vascular malformation are suspected. MR venography is indicated to evaluate for venous sinus thrombosis; this is particularly important in full term infants. MR spectroscopy can be performed where available to evaluate for certain metabolites such as glycine (nonketotic hyperglycinemia), lactate (mitochondrial disorders), or loss of creatine (disorder of brain creatine metabolism).</p><p>In a single-center prospective study of 77 infants with neonatal seizures, MRI was abnormal in 45 out of 70 infants imaged (64 percent). The most common findings were white matter abnormalities (19 percent), focal cortical abnormalities (14 percent), abnormal deep gray nuclei (13 percent), and multifocal or diffuse cortical abnormalities (11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Isolated subdural or extradural hemorrhage was present in five cases. In nine cases, the diagnosis was made by MRI, as all other investigations were normal or nonspecific.</p><p>If an infant is not sufficiently stable for MRI, or if there is an anticipated delay in obtaining MRI, cranial ultrasound should be performed to evaluate for the presence of intracranial hemorrhage or hydrocephalus. Ultrasound has the advantage of being noninvasive and can be performed at the bedside. Ultrasound has high sensitivity and specificity for locating hemorrhages and defining ventricular size.

Among 29 neonates with epileptic encephalopathy who underwent genetic testing, 83 percent had a genetic etiology identified, most commonly <em>KCNQ2 </em>encephalopathy. Among 23 neonates with brain malformations, 7 had a putative genetic etiology.

When genetic testing is performed, we suggest using a gene panel for epileptic encephalopathies and brain malformations, or whole exome sequencing, rather than serial testing of single genes.

As such, seizures may indicate the presence of a potentially treatable etiology and should prompt an immediate evaluation to determine cause and to institute etiology-specific therapy.

The most common clinical seizure types in neonates are focal-clonic, focal-tonic, some types of myoclonic, and epileptic spasms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59395\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59395 \">table 3</a>), but most neonatal seizures are subclinical.
