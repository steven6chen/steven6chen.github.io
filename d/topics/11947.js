These drugs differ in their dose, drug interactions, and some side effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70067\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70067 \">table 1</a>). Most NSAIDs are absorbed completely, have negligible first-pass hepatic metabolism, are tightly bound to serum proteins, and have small volumes of distribution.</p><p>NSAIDs undergo hepatic transformations variously by CYP2C8, 2C9, 2C19 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> glucuronidation. Half-lives of the NSAIDs vary but in general can be divided into &quot;short-acting&quot; (less than six hours, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoprofen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>) and &quot;long-acting&quot; (more than six hours, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meloxicam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meloxicam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nabumetone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nabumetone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piroxicam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piroxicam</a>). Patients with hypoalbuminemia (due, for example, to cirrhosis or active rheumatoid arthritis) may have a higher free serum concentration of the drug.</p><p>Assessment of toxicity and therapeutic response to a given NSAID must take into account the time needed to reach the steady state plasma concentration (roughly equal to three to five half-lives of the drug). The pathogenesis of symptomatic peptic ulcer disease caused by exposure to NSAIDs is mainly a consequence of systemic (post-absorptive) inhibition of gastrointestinal mucosal cyclooxygenase (COX) activity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Pathogenesis of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Like other drugs, NSAIDs with a longer half-life tend to have greater enterohepatic circulation of active metabolites.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cyclooxygenase inhibition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary effect of NSAIDs is to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX; prostaglandin synthase), thereby impairing the ultimate transformation of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, prostacyclin, and thromboxanes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66146\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66146 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The extent of enzyme inhibition varies among the different NSAIDS, although there are no studies relating the degree of COX inhibition with antiinflammatory efficacy in individual patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Cyclooxygenase enzymes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two related isoforms of the COX enzyme have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]: COX-1 (PGHS-1) and COX-2 (PGHS-2). The COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms possess 60 percent homology in those amino acid sequences apparently conserved for catalysis of arachidonic acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. A splice variant derived from the COX-1 gene has been described, but the relevance of this isoform is still unclear.</p><p>The degree to which a particular NSAID inhibits an isoform of cyclooxygenase may affect both its activity and toxicity; there are important differences in the regulation and expression of these enzymes in various tissues:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>COX-1 </strong>&ndash; COX-1 is expressed in most tissues but variably.

The mRNA for COX-1b appears to be expressed at a high level in the central nervous system, with transcripts accounting for 5 percent of COX mRNA in some studies; it has also been found in the heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>COX-2 </strong>&ndash; COX-2 is a highly regulated enzyme that is constitutively expressed in the brain, kidney, bone, and probably in the female reproductive system, but which is undetectable in most other tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Its expression is increased during states of inflammation, or experimentally in response to mitogenic stimuli.

This observation may contribute to the significant antiinflammatory effects of the glucocorticoids. The efficacy and safety of selective COX-2 inhibitors are discussed in further detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of selective COX-2 inhibitors&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>COX-2 has an important role in the inflammatory process, although the effect of COX-2 inhibition on inflammation is not completely understood:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>COX-2 knockout mice are less susceptible to inflammation in some models than intact mice, but responses differ depending upon the model of inflammation employed for study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>COX-1 knockout mice show less ulceration after the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> than intact mice, even though their gastric prostaglandin E2 levels are reduced by 99 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>COX-2 may have antiinflammatory properties. Using an animal model of inflammation and carrageenin-induced pleurisy, one study showed that maximal COX-2 expression coincided with inflammatory resolution and was associated with minimal prostaglandin E2 synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human T lymphocytes express the COX-2 isoenzyme where it may serve a role in both the early and late events of T-cell activation, such as the production of IL-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interferon-gamma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although selective COX-2 inhibition may produce less gastric toxicity, there has been concern that COX-2 inhibition could delay healing of gastric erosions or ulcers and may enhance injury in an inflamed tissue, as in an experimental model of colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. These observations may have clinical importance in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in whom nonselective NSAIDs can exacerbate the disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of ulcerative colitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A clinically significant delay in healing of ulcers was not observed in the clinical trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>, which is considered a relatively selective inhibitor of COX-2 at usual therapeutic doses. However, approximately 40 percent of the patients included in the trials were required to be free of ulcers prior to study entry. Thus, the effect of celecoxib on ulcer healing in patients with preexisting ulcer disease has not been well-established.</p><p/><p>Some older NSAIDs are also relatively selective for the COX-2 receptor at low doses. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nabumetone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nabumetone</a>, for example, appears to be a more effective inhibitor in some experimental systems of COX-2 than COX-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etodolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Etodolac</a> also inhibits the COX-2 isoform more than COX-1 (10 to 1 ratio) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>Further discussion relating to COX-2 inhibitors is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of selective COX-2 inhibitors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Studies with salicylates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a human whole cell system, salicylates are very potent inhibitors of both COX-1 and COX-2, with the latter inducible form being more sensitive to the effects of the drug than the constitutive enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, salicylates barely inhibit the COX enzyme in pure cell-free enzyme systems, and their effects are not measurable in cell membrane systems. Although the nonacetylated salicylates are not good prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors in vitro, clinical studies have shown that these drugs (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salsalate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salsalate</a>) may be as effective as other NSAIDs with respect to their antiinflammatory effects in patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> are described in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-mechanism-of-action-major-toxicities-and-use-in-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin: Mechanism of action, major toxicities, and use in rheumatic diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The effects of acetylsalicylic acid on COX-2 activity are very different from the effects on COX-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Acetylated COX-1 and COX-2 cannot form the intermediate products of prostaglandin synthesis. However, acetylated COX-2 retains the capacity to alter arachidonic acid to form 15(R)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15R-HETE), while acetylated COX-1 does not. 15R-HETE has unknown biochemical effects, but it may be important as a modulator of proliferation since it is a product of an inducible enzyme during states of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This effect on proliferation may have several interesting ramifications, including the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for the prevention of colon cancer. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Apoptosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Role in prevention of colorectal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23148739\"><span class=\"h3\">Studies with topical NSAIDs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several NSAIDs are now available as topical formulations. There is evidence that these agents are effective compared with placebo for several chronic painful conditions, including osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Moreover, there are data demonstrating that these agents are absorbed and penetrate local tissues in the area of application [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].&nbsp;Topical application of NSAIDs limits systemic absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] and the associated side effects and drug interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-prostaglandin-mediated effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several non-prostaglandin-mediated mechanisms of action have been postulated to explain the antiinflammatory actions of the nonacetylated salicylates, although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (the only acetylated NSAID) is not thought to have antiinflammatory effects other than those related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis; these observations may also apply, to a varying degree, to the nonsalicylate NSAIDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some of these effects appear to be related to the physicochemical property of NSAIDs that enables them to insert into biological membranes and disrupt important interactions necessary for cell function (eg, transmembrane anion transport, oxidative phosphorylation, and uptake of arachidonate).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neutrophil function is inhibited by nonacetylated salicylates and other nonsalicylate NSAIDs in vitro. As an example, NSAIDs interfere with the neutrophil-endothelial cell adherence that is critical for the ability to respond to inflammation. NSAIDs decrease the expression of L-selectin, which removes a crucial step in the migration of granulocytes to sites of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p>The role of these non-prostaglandin-mediated processes in clinical inflammation remains unclear. Despite the fact that nonacetylated salicylates have shown equal antiinflammatory efficacy when compared with acetylsalicylic acid in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], there is no clear evidence that COX inhibition is not achieved at the doses of drug required to achieve an antiinflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/2,3,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,38</a>].</p><p>NSAIDS have also been demonstrated in vitro to inhibit nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-dependent transcription, leading to inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. NOS, once induced by cytokines and other proinflammatory mediators, produces NO in large amounts, thereby leading to increased inflammation (including vasocongestion, cytotoxicity, and vascular permeability) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Therapeutic levels of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> inhibit expression of iNOS and the subsequent production of nitrite in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Sodium salicylate and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> have no such effects at pharmacologic doses, although, at suprapharmacologic dosages, sodium salicylate also inhibits nitrite production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>The inhibition of NF-kappaB by salicylates may be responsible for the capacity of salicyl salicylate (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=salsalate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salsalate</a>) to reduce levels of HbA<sub>1c</sub> and to improve other markers of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes; such studies were based, in part, on the observation that NF-kappaB is activated by obesity and promotes insulin resistance and risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Apoptosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A novel effect of NSAIDs has been described involving prostaglandin inhibition. Prostaglandins inhibit apoptosis (programmed cell death) in vivo; NSAIDs, therefore, establish a more normal cell cycle in the inflammatory state via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. An important extension of these observations may be the association between the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, and perhaps other NSAIDs, and a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Role in prevention of colorectal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The mechanism of this protective effect cannot be entirely attributed to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. The two prerequisites for the development of cancer are proliferation and the inhibition of apoptosis. One study found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulindac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulindac</a> decreased the size of adenomatous polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis by increasing apoptosis rather than altering proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Celecoxib</a> has also been shown to reduce the development of adenomas in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and in patients with sporadic adenomatous polyps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>].

Although the nonacetylated salicylates are not good prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors in vitro, clinical studies have shown that these drugs (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salsalate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salsalate</a>) may be as effective as other NSAIDs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Studies with salicylates'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several non-prostaglandin-mediated mechanisms of action have been postulated to explain the actions of the nonacetylated salicylates; these observations may also apply, to a varying degree, to the nonsalicylate NSAIDs. These include disruption of interactions necessary for cell function through actions in cell membranes and inhibition of neutrophil function, including endothelial cell adherence, by nonacetylated salicylates and other nonsalicylate NSAIDs in vitro. NSAIDS have also been demonstrated in vitro to inhibit nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-dependent transcription, leading to inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS).
