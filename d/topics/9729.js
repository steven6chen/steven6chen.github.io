In 2008, the first international consensus meeting established the feasibility and safety of LLR and defined its indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>The subsequent decade saw an increase in the overall number of liver surgeries performed and an exponential growth in LLR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. A 2016 review documented close to 10,000 procedures of LLR performed worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The technical expertise associated with LLR has also improved as more procedures were performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/3,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,7</a>]. </p><p>The use of LLR for minor hepatectomy has increased more rapidly than that for major hepatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In 2014, a second consensus conference concluded that LLR had become standard practice for minor hepatectomy but remained &quot;exploratory&quot; for major hepatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, these recommendations were made based on low-quality evidence, as no randomized trial has been performed to compare LLR with its open counterpart.</p><p>In this topic, we review the indications, patient selection, learning curve, surgical techniques, and outcomes of LLR. Other aspects of liver surgery, such as preoperative imaging to determine future liver remnant and techniques for open liver resection (OLR), are discussed in other topics.

Approximately 25 percent of LLRs for malignancy are performed for CRLM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

However, experts caution that the availability of LLR is not a reason to expand the resection criteria for benign conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/3,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20</a>]. </p><p>Common indications for resecting benign hepatic lesions include relevant clinical symptoms, size &gt;5 cm in patients with hepatic adenoma, lesions with potential for malignant transformation (eg, mucinous cystadenoma), and imaging findings concerning for malignancy (eg, suspicious nodules in a cirrhotic liver or malignant-appearing mass with nonspecific tissue diagnosis). Patients not meeting these criteria are best managed with observation rather than surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Those with underlying liver diseases (eg, cirrhosis, chemotherapy) must have sufficient future liver remnant after resection as determined by preoperative imaging. Additionally, the following disease and patient factors determine whether or not a patient is a good candidate for LLR:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesions most amenable for LLR are solitary masses of &le;5 cm located in one of the peripheral liver segments (II to VI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81897\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81897 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Laparoscopic resection of such lesions typically entails a minor hepatectomy, which is widely performed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Larger (&gt;5 cm), posterosuperior segment (VII and VIII), multiple, or bilobar lesions are anatomically more difficult to resect laparoscopically. Although initially considered contraindicated, LLRs for such lesions are performed at centers of expertise around the world with increasing frequency. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hilar lesions and centrally located tumors in close proximity to major hepatic vessels or the inferior vena cava remain relative contraindications for LLR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/3,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22</a>], although some centers have performed LLR of such lesions with outcomes comparable to those of OLR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with intolerance of pneumoperitoneum due to cardiopulmonary disease should not undergo LLR. The establishment of pneumoperitoneum may cause an initial reduction in cardiac index, which some patients with aortic stenosis or other cardiac conditions may not tolerate. Proper risk stratification of such patients is essential during preoperative assessment for potential LLR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with upper abdominal adhesions that cannot be lysed laparoscopically should not undergo LLR. In one report, patients undergoing LLR for colorectal liver metastasis were more likely to have intraoperative complications following a previous open, as opposed to laparoscopic, colorectal resection (26 versus 14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rate of conversion from LLR to OLR in the literature ranged from 0 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Patients with one of these risk factors should be warned about the possibility of a conversion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the authors' experience, advanced liver cirrhosis, including portal hypertension, is not a contraindication to LLR. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For selected nonperipheral intraparenchymal lesions in the posterosuperior segments, laparoscopic parenchymal-sparing liver resection has been successfully performed without compromising safety or perioperative and oncologic outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2850125838\"><span class=\"h1\">LEARNING CURVE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LLR is a difficult procedure that requires expertise in both liver surgery and advanced laparoscopy. Studies evaluating the skill acquisition process for LLR have suggested a learning curve of 45 to 60 cases for major hepatectomy and 20 to 25 cases for minor hepatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/28-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-33</a>]. </p><p>The learning curve for LLR is often not linear &ndash; an initial steep rise is followed by a plateau, only to be followed by a second steep rise brought on by attempting more complex cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/28-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-33</a>]. A nonlinear learning curve calls for continued vigilance while performing LLR and a graduated approach to taking on more challenging and complex resections (eg, right hepatectomy) as the surgeon's experience grows.</p><p>For complex LLRs such as right hepatectomy, standardizing techniques and dividing the procedure into smaller components (steps) have been proposed to make the operation more reproducible and teachable. A standardized, stepwise approach also permits identification of variances in performance and suggesting areas for improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4212427679\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LLR can be performed with purely laparoscopic, hand-assisted, and hybrid techniques. The choice depends primarily on the training and experience of the surgeon but can also be influenced by patient and tumor factors. As an example, large or posterior tumors are more amenable to a hand-assisted resection than a purely laparoscopic approach. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Purely laparoscopic LLR</strong> is performed using only laparoscopic instruments. Besides trocar placements, only a small incision is required for specimen extraction. This approach is least invasive but most technically challenging. In case of unexpected bleeding, there are fewer options for rapid control than the other techniques. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hand-assisted LLR</strong> uses a 5- to 9-cm abdominal incision to admit the surgeon's or assistant's hand into the operative field via a gastight port (hand port). Having a hand in the operative field permits palpation of the liver with tactile feedback, facilitates manipulation of the liver during dissection, and enables manual compression in case of unexpected bleeding. Extraction of the specimen is also done through the hand port site. Compared with purely laparoscopic LLR, hand-assisted LLR has disadvantages of a greater risk of incisional hernia at the hand port site and partially obstructed laparoscopic visualization by the hand. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The hybrid technique</strong> mobilizes the liver with laparoscopic instruments and transects the liver parenchyma through a small laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/3,30,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,30,33</a>]. The hybrid technique was advocated early in the development of LLR primarily due to concerns of gas embolus associated with exposing the raw cut surface of the liver to carbon dioxide under pressure of the pneumoperitoneum. Subsequent studies have ameliorated this concern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, the hybrid technique is used less commonly than the other two techniques.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3763161357\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is placed supine on the operating table for intubation and induction of general anesthesia. Patients typically require secure intravenous access to allow large-volume fluid and blood product resuscitation, intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring, and low central venous pressure until liver parenchyma is divided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-liver-disease#H2640527372\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the patient with liver disease&quot;, section on 'Anesthesia for hepatic resection'</a>.)</p><p>Orogastric tube and Foley catheter are routinely placed. A nasogastric tube is appropriate if bile duct resection with bile duct to bowel anastomosis is planned. </p><p>The supine position is used for left or right hepatectomy and minor hepatectomies such as left lateral segmentectomy or nonanatomic resection of lesions in segments IV or V (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81897\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81897 \">figure 1</a>). Patients with right posterior sector tumors (segments VI and VII) are placed in a left semilateral decubitus position with the right side up at approximately a 45&deg; angle. Patients are secured in that position with a bean bag, the right arm is supported by an armrest, and pillows are placed between the legs that have a slight bend at the knees (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106621\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106621 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p>Following this, the patient's knees and upper chest are strapped or taped to the bed in anticipation of possible radical changes in the bed position, including steep Trendelenburg (head up) or reverse Trendelenburg (head down) positions. All bony prominences must be appropriately padded. </p><p>The abdomen is then prepped and draped from midchest to symphysis pubis and bilaterally to the midaxillary lines. We outline a bilateral subcostal incision with a marker in all patients in preparation for possible conversion to open surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3636193276\"><span class=\"h2\">Peritoneal access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We prefer to establish pneumoperitoneum with a Veress needle placed 2 cm below the left costal margin at the midclavicular line. After confirmation of intra-abdominal position of the needle, the abdomen is insufflated with carbon dioxide to a pressure of 15 mmHg. A history of prior abdominal operations, hepatosplenomegaly, or left upper quadrant adhesions may require an alternative technique, such as the open Hasson technique or the optical trocar peritoneal entry technique. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-access-techniques-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery#H651891356\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal access techniques used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Peritoneal access'</a>.)</p><p>Laparoscopic ports are then placed under direct vision based on the planned procedure. Although the general locations of ports are standardized for each procedure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111685\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111685 \">figure 3</a>), the surgeon still needs to fine-tune port placement for each patient by taking into account the patient's body habitus, liver size, and tumor <span class=\"nowrap\">location/size</span>. </p><p>Because LLR approaches the abdomen anteriorly, posterior (segment VII) or superior tumors (segment VIII) are particularly challenging to resect. These tumors may lend themselves to additional modifications in technique by combining abdominal and transdiaphragmatic trocars for optimal access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542411402\"><span class=\"h2\">Laparoscopic and ultrasound exploration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After gaining peritoneal access, a 30&deg;, 5-mm laparoscope is inserted and the abdominal cavity is assessed for any evidence of metastatic disease or other contraindications to resection. The liver surface is inspected for tumors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> evidence of liver cirrhosis or fibrosis. Large or peripheral tumors can be readily identified laparoscopically.</p><p>Following that, laparoscopic ultrasound is routinely performed to identify tumors deep in the parenchyma, characterize the intrahepatic vascular anatomy, and search for unexpected pathology in the future liver remnant.

The gallbladder is sometimes used as a handle for retraction and not removed until a later time of the operation. Division of avascular attachments to the right liver requires caution to avoid injury to the right diaphragm, right adrenal gland, and inferior vena cava. In laparoscopic surgery, short venous branches to the vena cava can be divided more expeditiously with a bipolar vessel-sealing device or hemoclips than with ties or suture ligatures (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=instruments-and-devices-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Instruments and devices used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Devices for hemostasis'</a>). Division of such short venous branches is typically required during right hepatectomy.</p><p>For lesions located in the left lobe of the liver, the left triangular ligaments are divided to the level of the left hepatic vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67698\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67698 \">figure 4</a>). This dissection requires caution to avoid injury to the left diaphragm and can occasionally be difficult because of diaphragmatic motion caused by the beating heart.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H253406439\"><span class=\"h2\">Cholecystectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Removal of the gallbladder is required for major hepatectomy but is infrequently necessary for nonanatomic resections, with the exceptions of tumors in segments IVb or V (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81897\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81897 \">figure 1</a>). In major hepatectomy, cholecystectomy may be delayed until later in the operation to use the gallbladder as a handle for retraction. When performed, laparoscopic cholecystectomy should follow the standard technique established to ensure identification of the critical view of safety before division of the cystic artery and duct and removal of the gallbladder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-cholecystectomy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic cholecystectomy&quot;, section on 'Standard procedure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2360532204\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In major hepatectomy (eg, right or left hepatectomy), control of vascular inflow and outflow minimizes blood loss during parenchymal transection. Vascular control can be accomplished in the extrahepatic space or within the liver parenchyma. Minor hepatectomy does not typically require formal vascular control before parenchymal transection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H371281703\"><span class=\"h3\">Inflow control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extrahepatic inflow control is accomplished by dissection and division of the right or left hepatic artery and portal vein in the porta hepatis. </p><p>Dissection in the porta hepatis begins by dividing anterior connective tissue and small vessels with a vessel-sealing device. It is safe to dissect the hilar plate close to the liver capsule and &quot;drop&quot; the critical structures (ie, exposing more length of vessels beyond the respective bifurcations). </p><p>Assuming normal anatomy, the common hepatic artery is identified on the anteromedial (left) side of the portal triad (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F103682\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103682 \">figure 5</a>). Once the hepatic artery bifurcation is confirmed, the right or left hepatic artery is divided with a vascular stapler. The bifurcation of the portal vein is easier to identify once the divided hepatic artery has retracted away, and division of the right or left portal vein is also accomplished with a vascular stapler. A curved-tip stapler may be required to divide the portal vein because the portal vein bifurcation is close to the liver capsule and the space to insert a stapler is often limited. </p><p>A Glissonian approach permits division of the hepatic inflow from within the liver parenchyma. We most commonly use a Glissonian approach for right hepatectomy. The Glissonian approach to inflow control begins with making small incisions in the liver capsule in the gallbladder fossa and the caudate lobe. Through these small incisions, the right hepatic inflow is bluntly dissected and encircled with a silk suture. The suture then guides passage of a vascular stapler. It usually takes three or four serial &quot;firings&quot; of the stapler to completely divide the vascular pedicle with associated liver parenchyma. Other surgeons have described Glissonian approaches to dividing second-order vascular pedicles, which would permit sectorial or segmental resections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Depending on the clinical situation, location of the lesion, and surgeon expertise, the Glissonian approach can be performed with either the purely laparoscopic or hand-assisted technique. </p><p>Inflow control during LLR has been associated with decreased blood loss and operative time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] and has been advocated by experts along with other methods of bleeding control such as maintaining pneumoperitoneum at a pressure of at least 10 to 14 mmHg and low central venous pressure of &lt;5 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3880798313\"><span class=\"h3\">Outflow control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extrahepatic control of the right or left hepatic vein begins with elevation of the posterior liver off the vena cava and division of short hepatic veins. </p><p>For the right hepatic vein, dissection between the right and middle vein is facilitated by a &quot;notch&quot; typically visible on the anterior surface of the liver along the medial edge of the right hepatic vein. Along the undersurface of the liver, a thick, often vascularized ligament of tissue along the lateral aspect of the vena cava (&quot;caval ligament&quot;) is located just below the origin of the right hepatic vein. This is divided with a stapler facilitating the encircling of the right hepatic vein with dissection from anterior and posterior surfaces. The right hepatic vein is then divided with a vascular stapler. </p><p>The left and middle hepatic vein typically have a common origin, and therefore both are divided if extrahepatic vascular outflow control is needed in the setting of left hepatectomy. Dissection on the anterior surface is facilitated by the same &quot;notch&quot; on the lateral side of the middle hepatic vein described above. On the undersurface of the liver, connective tissue over the caudate lobe (gastrohepatic <span class=\"nowrap\">ligament/pars</span> flaccida) is divided. A vessel loop is then passed around the origins of both the middle and left hepatic veins to retract the veins and facilitate division with a vascular stapler. </p><p>Intrahepatic division of the hepatic vein is most often done with a vascular stapler during the final portion of liver parenchymal transection. Such divisions typically proceed in an <span class=\"nowrap\">anterior/caudal</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">posterior/cranial</span> direction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2938694309\"><span class=\"h2\">Parenchymal transection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once major hepatic inflow (hepatic artery and portal vein) has been interrupted to either the right or left lobe of the liver, a line of ischemic demarcation should become evident. Intraoperative ultrasound may again be used to confirm that the target lesion lies within the devascularized hepatic parenchyma and not the future liver remnant. When in doubt, it may be necessary to extend a portion of the parenchymal transection beyond the line of ischemic demarcation and prepare for greater blood loss. </p><p>We place an umbilical tape around the portal triad through the foramen of Winslow for selective use of temporary complete vascular inflow occlusion (Pringle maneuver) whenever necessary during parenchymal transection. </p><p>Electrocautery is typically used to score the hepatic capsule and create the initial line of transection. Liver parenchyma is then transected with a combination of vessel-sealing (energy) devices for liver tissue and small vascular and biliary structures and a vascular stapler for larger intrahepatic vascular structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H855537750\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemostasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For hand-assisted LLR, we first apply direct manual pressure to the cut surface of the liver with a warm sponge for 5 to 10 minutes. Following that, we routinely use a bipolar vessel-sealing device (eg, Aquamantys) to treat the liver surface (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=instruments-and-devices-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Instruments and devices used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Devices for hemostasis'</a>). Other commonly used methods of achieving hemostasis include the argon beam electrocautery device and hemostatic agents such as oxidized cellulose, bovine collagen, and fibrin-based sealants (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives#H1853646402\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of topical hemostatic agents and tissues adhesives&quot;, section on 'Hemostatic agents'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibrin-sealants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibrin sealants&quot;</a>). Since pneumoperitoneum may mask some bleeding by tamponade, we release the pressure for several minutes before reinsufflating and examining the cut surface for bleeding for the final time. </p><p>Once the liver parenchyma is divided and hemostasis is achieved, it is important to communicate to the anesthesia team so that the patient can be fluid-resuscitated back to euvolemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/39,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3615381141\"><span class=\"h2\">Specimen extraction and closing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An impermeable bag is introduced through one of the larger trocars and used for specimen removal with slight extension of the incision. In hand-assisted LLR, the specimen is usually removed through the hand port incision while keeping the wound protector portion of the hand port device in place. Port sites &gt;5 mm are closed at the fascial level. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-access-techniques-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery#H651891636\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal access techniques used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Fascial closure'</a>.)</p><p>Prior to closing, we place one closed suction drain along the cut surface of the liver after major hepatectomy if there are any intraoperative concerns for bile leak. Otherwise, no drain is placed. In several retrospective studies, perihepatic drain placement did not prevent bile leak or the need for subsequent interventions and might have actually increased the complication rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-liver-resection/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3873471685\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMONLY PERFORMED PROCEDURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Basic steps of laparoscopic right hepatectomy, left hepatectomy, and left lateral segmentectomy are described below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111688\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111688 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3687463864\"><span class=\"h2\">Laparoscopic right hepatectomy</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Position the patient supine and insert five laparoscopic ports (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111685\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111685 \">figure 3</a>).
