The major question that follows detection of a pulmonary nodule is the probability of malignancy, with subsequent management varying accordingly. The approach in this topic applies to nodules found <strong>incidentally </strong>in patients &ge;35 years old without signs or symptoms attributable to the lesion and with a baseline risk of lung cancer equivalent to that of the general population. Separate strategies and individual adjustments are needed for other populations including patients who are undergoing lung cancer screening and for those who are immunocompromised, have a history of malignancy actively under treatment or follow-up, or are presenting with pulmonary symptoms (ie, suspected lung cancer). </p><p>The approach to patients with suspected lung cancer and indications for lung cancer screening are discussed separately.

Morphologically, nodules are classified as solid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F113384\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef113384 \">image 1</a>) or subsolid; subsolid nodules are subdivided into pure ground-glass nodules (ie, no solid component) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F113385\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef113385 \">image 2</a>) and part-solid nodules (ie, both ground-glass and solid components) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F113386\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef113386 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Lesions that measure &gt;30 mm are considered masses, rather than nodules, harbor a much higher likelihood of being malignant, and are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the initial evaluation, diagnosis, and staging of patients with suspected lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Multiple pulmonary nodules are, on occasion, also encountered incidentally. In this setting, the diagnostic evaluation refers to the predominant type or the most suspicious nodule (eg, largest, growing). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of incidental pulmonary nodules can be categorized as benign or malignant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62644\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62644 \">table 1</a>). The estimated frequency of each etiology varies substantially among studies, reflecting differences in the population studied and the methodology used to establish a diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/5-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-11</a>]. Nonetheless, screening studies of smokers who are at high risk of malignancy suggest that the vast majority of nodules identified on computed tomography (CT) are benign. As an example, in the Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer and the British Columbia Cancer Agency studies, among the 12,029 nodules found, only 144 (1 percent) were malignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The incidence of malignant nodules is likely much lower in patient at average or low risk for lung cancer. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignant etiologies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common causes of a malignant nodule include primary lung cancer, lung metastases, and carcinoid tumors.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary lung cancer &ndash; Adenocarcinoma is the histologic subtype of primary lung cancer that most commonly presents as a pulmonary nodule, followed by squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma. Both adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma share a tendency to originate as a peripheral lesion, whereas squamous cell carcinoma presents more frequently as a central lesion than as a peripheral nodule. In one review, most of the malignant nodules were adenocarcinoma (50 percent) and squamous cell carcinoma (20 to 25 percent); each of the other pathologic categories accounted for less than 10 percent of malignant pulmonary nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Rarely, primary extranodal lymphomas and primary pulmonary sarcomas can present as an incidental pulmonary nodule.

In a patient with a history of extrathoracic malignancy, the probability of metastasis is approximately 25 percent when a pulmonary nodule is detected on a chest radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, most metastases do not present as an <strong>incidental</strong> pulmonary nodule because the patient typically already carries the diagnosis of the primary cancer. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carcinoid tumors &ndash; Although carcinoid tumors are typically endobronchial, approximately 20 percent present as a peripheral, well-circumscribed pulmonary nodule.

Endemic fungi (eg, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis) and mycobacteria (either tuberculous or nontuberculous mycobacteria) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F99561\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99561 \">image 4</a>) are the most frequently recognized causes of infectious granulomas presenting as a pulmonary nodule. While not pathognomonic, they classically appear as a well-demarcated and fully-calcified or centrally calcified nodule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F99558\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99558 \">image 5</a>). However, more frequently, they are not diagnosed until the lesion is resected as a presumed cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Less commonly, infection with abscess-forming bacteria (eg, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em>) can present as a pulmonary nodule, which may cavitate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. Rarely, dirofilariasis, a mosquito-borne disease, presents as a pulmonary nodule. Injected larvae embolize to the lungs and induce a granulomatous response, typically resulting in a noncalcified, peripheral nodule that is mistaken for cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=miscellaneous-nematodes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Miscellaneous nematodes&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Benign tumors</strong> &ndash; Hamartomas cause approximately 10 percent of benign nodules found in the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/2,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,10</a>]. They typically present in middle age, grow slowly over years, and are radiologically and histologically heterogeneous. Cartilage (with scattered calcification), fat, muscle, myxomatous tissue, and fibroblastic tissue may all exist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61914\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61914 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62271%7EPULM%2F72996\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62271 graphicRef72996 \">picture 2A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F99567\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99567 \">image 6</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The classically described and pathognomonic appearance of a hamartoma on a chest radiograph is a nodule with &quot;popcorn&quot; calcification, although this pattern is observed in less than 10 percent of cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80219\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80219 \">image 7</a>). High-resolution CT of the lesion is particularly useful because it may demonstrate focal areas of fat, or calcification alternating with fat, which are virtually diagnostic of a hamartoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F99563\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99563 \">image 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Less common benign neoplasms such as fibromas, leiomyomas, hemangiomas, amyloidoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F99733\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99733 \">image 9</a>), and pneumocytoma (also called pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma) do not have characteristic features on imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F99566\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99566 \">image 10</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vascular </strong>&ndash; Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are common in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia but can also be idiopathic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56072\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56072 \">image 11</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F99565\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99565 \">image 12</a>). When a PAVM is suspected on CT (eg, a feeding artery and vein is seen) biopsy should be avoided. Rarer causes of incidental pulmonary nodules that are vascular in nature include pulmonary infarcts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F99736\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99736 \">image 13</a>), pulmonary varices, and pulmonary contusion or hematoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62644\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62644 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations: Clinical features and diagnostic evaluation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other</strong> &ndash; Inflammatory lesions (granulomatosis with polyangiitis [formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis], rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, rounded atelectasis), perifissural pulmonary lymph nodes, and developmental lesions (bronchogenic cyst) are unusual causes of benign nodules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62644\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62644 \">table 1</a>). The presence of systemic disease elsewhere may increase the likelihood of an inflammatory nodule, but not all patients will have such a history since nodules can occasionally be the initial presenting feature of the underlying disease. Rarely are pulmonary nodules due to artifact such as pseudotumor (loculated fluid in the interlobar fissure) or mucoid impaction; simple maneuvers such as diuresis and cough assistance may result in the resolution of nodules due to such entities on follow-up imaging. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation should use clinical features, radiographic features, and occasionally quantitative models to determine the likelihood of malignancy.

Studies that have compared the accuracy of clinician judgment with quantitative prediction models report modest to excellent agreement in estimating the probability of malignancy, suggesting that clinical assessment and prediction models may be complementary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. </p><p>Although no single quantitative predictive model is superior, they all combine clinical and imaging features to estimate the probability of malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/25,27-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27-33</a>]. They are most useful for nodules that are 8 to 30 mm to facilitate patient discussion and guide management choices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Typically, lesions &gt;30 mm are resected because they have such a high likelihood of malignancy that the benefit of resection outweighs the associated risk of surgery. In contrast, nodules &le;8 mm (without documented growth) are often followed with serial CT because these lesions have a low likelihood of malignancy such that the benefits of resection do not justify the risk of technically difficult resective surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/3,34-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,34-40</a>]. Thus, estimating the probability of malignancy in both of these settings is unlikely to change the diagnostic strategy. However, the risk of malignancy and diagnostic options are widely variable in nodules that are 8 to 30 mm. Thus, estimating the pretest probability of malignancy in that setting will facilitate the selection and interpretation of subsequent diagnostic tests. </p><p>Quantitative predictive models that have been validated for use include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/12,27-29,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,27-29,41</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A full and simplified version of one model was derived using data collected from the Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer screening study and validated using data from the British Columbia Cancer Agency study (Brock model) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Predictors of cancer were identified in 2961 patients with nodules found on first screening CT and included the following: older age, female sex, family history of lung cancer, emphysema, larger nodule size, location of the nodule in the upper lobe, part-solid nodule type, lower nodule count, and spiculation. Both full and simplified versions of the model showed excellent discrimination between benign and malignant nodules, even when applied to nodules typically difficult to characterize (nodule &le;10 mm). While the negative predictive value of this model was consistently high (99 percent), the sensitivity ranged from 60 to 86 percent when different cut-off thresholds were used. The probability of malignancy can be calculated using the calculator (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-solitary-pulmonary-nodule-malignancy-risk-in-adults-brock-university-cancer-prediction-equation\" class=\"calc calc_patient\">calculator 1</a>).

The increased incidence of adenocarcinoma, which is more likely to present as a subsolid and part-solid nodule, gives this model a distinct advantage over the others. However, this model only estimated the probability of malignancy in a population at high risk for lung cancer (current or ex-smokers).

Independent predictors of malignant nodules included the following: smoking history (current or former) (odds ratio [OR] 7.9), older age (OR 2.2 per 10-year increment), larger nodule diameter (OR 1.1 per 1 mm increment), and time since quitting smoking (OR 0.6 per 10-year increment). This model showed excellent agreement between the predicted probability and the observed frequency of malignant nodules.

Solid nodules &le;8 mm (also known as &quot;subcentimeter&quot; nodules) are less likely to be malignant, are difficult to biopsy, not reliably characterized by functional imaging, and, hence, best characterized with CT surveillance.

Compared with solid nodules, subsolid nodules are often less amenable to functional imaging and biopsy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The incidence of subsolid nodules is increasing, likely due to the rising incidence of adenocarcinoma worldwide and the increasing use of CT.

As examples, malignancy is rare in small (&le;10 mm) nodules that are pure ground-glass and more common (10 to 50 percent) in larger lesions (&gt;10 mm). In contrast, malignancy will be identified in at least half of ground-glass lesions that have a large (&gt;50 percent) or newly developed solid component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1397156789\"><span class=\"h5\">Growth or stable size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For solid nodules, growth is defined as an increase in size of &gt;2 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. For subsolid nodules, growth can also be identified as an increased attenuation or an increase in the size of or development of a solid component. Size is measured as the average of the long and short axes, rounded to the nearest millimeter. Reliable assessment of nodule growth requires chest CT acquired as contiguous 1 mm section images for pulmonary nodule evaluation. </p><p/><p>Differences in scanning techniques, such as use of thick sections for previous imaging, may make comparison less accurate, especially for smaller nodules. Reader variability is also a factor, especially for small nodules. One study found that, when measuring nodules 20 mm or less, the limits of intra-reader and inter-reader variability were 1.32 mm and 1.73 mm, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. This means that a nodule can only be confidently said to have grown if its diameter has increased beyond these limits. </p><p>Traditionally, a nodule that remained stable for two years or longer on a chest radiograph was considered benign. However, retrospective studies suggest that lack of appreciable growth on a chest radiograph over a two-year duration has a poor positive predictive value (65 percent) for a benign lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/2,61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,61,62</a>]. Compared with chest radiography, CT can better detect changes in diameter (0.5 mm change versus 3 to 5 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Studies that assess the volume doubling time (VDT) of cancers have been helpful in predicting the probability of malignancy in a pulmonary nodule. Most malignant nodules have a VDT between 20 and 400 days, with slower VDTs (&gt;400 days) observed in typical carcinoid and in preinvasive or low grade adenocarcinoma (eg, adenocarcinoma in situ [AIS] and minimally-invasive adenocarcinoma [MIA]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/2,5,63-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,63-66</a>]. Thus, a nodule that has increased in size over a short period of time (&lt;20 days) or is stable for a prolonged period of time on CT (&gt;2 years) is likely benign. These data largely apply to solid nodules. In contrast, subsolid nodules are more likely to be seen with early or low grade adenocarcinoma, which has a slower average VDT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. One retrospective study reported median VDTs of malignant nodules according to their CT attenuation characteristics as: ground-glass (813 days), ground-glass with a solid component (457 days), and solid (149 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Thus, purely ground-glass lesions may be less readily detected as actively growing by CT, and follow-up for five years to determine stability is probably warranted in that population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. </p><p>Some groups consider a &lt;25 percent change in volume as not significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

There are four benign patterns of calcification, which are central, diffuse, laminated, and &quot;popcorn.&quot; Central, diffuse, and laminated are typically seen with prior infection, particularly histoplasmosis or tuberculosis. Popcorn calcification is characteristic of chondroid calcification in a hamartoma. However, lung cancers, typical and atypical pulmonary carcinoid tumors may calcify. Metastases from chondrosarcoma or osteosarcomas, in patients who carry a diagnosis of these cancers, may demonstrate calcified nodules that resemble benign granulomas. Indeterminate patterns of calcification (eg, punctate, eccentric, and amorphous) are nonspecific and not useful for diagnosis.</p><p>The presence of fat (attenuation, -40 to -120 Hounsfield units) within the nodule is a reliable indicator of a hamartoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F113387\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef113387 \">image 14</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/21,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,69</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3771946764\"><span class=\"h5\">Border and lobar location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the appearance of a nodule border can suggest a diagnosis, it cannot reliably distinguish between benign and malignant nodules. Typically, benign nodules have a well-defined, smooth border, whereas malignant lesions have a spiculated or lobular border. Spiculation is attributed to growth of malignant cells along the pulmonary interstitium, and lobulation to differential growth rates within nodules. While the majority of lesions with a spiculated margin (also described as a corona radiate sign) are malignant, this can also be seen with benign lesions. Conversely, a smooth margin does not exclude malignancy with many pulmonary metastases, and up to 20 percent of lung cancers have smooth margins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F99732\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99732 \">image 15</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/21,70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,70,71</a>].</p><p>Although malignant nodules can be found in any lobe of the lung, those that are located in the upper lobe have an increased probability of being malignant<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/12,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,27</a>].<strong> </strong>In one study of over 7000 nodules, among the 102 that were subsequently found to be malignant, almost two-thirds were located in the upper lobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The CT acquisition protocol includes non-contrast images, and images at one, two, three, and four minutes after the onset of intravenous contrast administration. Enhancement is calculated by subtracting the precontrast attenuation of the nodule from the peak attenuation after contrast. Typically, malignant nodules enhance more than 20 Hounsfield units, whereas nodules that enhance less than 15 Hounsfield units are likely benign (sensitivity, 98 percent; specificity, 58 percent; negative predictive value, 96 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H872574741\"><span class=\"h3\">Chest radiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most nodules detected on chest radiography will require chest CT without contrast for further evaluation.

Despite the provision of guidelines, the approaches used in practice are often inconsistent with these guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/26,88-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,88-91</a>]. </p><p>The evaluation strategy described here is intended to strike a balance between potentially life-saving benefits of detecting resectable lung cancer with possible morbidity associated with testing and interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/3,23,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,23,78</a>]. Our approach is based on an assumption that the risk of malignancy is that of <strong>incidental</strong> nodules of patients &ge;35 years old without signs or symptoms attributable to the lesion and with a baseline risk of lung cancer equivalent to that of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Direct applicability of this approach to nodules encountered in <strong>other</strong> <strong>clinical settings</strong> is less clear as the risk of malignancy varies. As an example, the likelihood of benign lesions (ie, infection, inflammation, benign tumor) is higher among patients &lt;35 years old. In contrast, the likelihood of malignancy is higher among patients who meet criteria for lung cancer screening. Thus, separate strategies and individual adjustments are needed for patient populations including those who are immunocompromised, with history of malignancy actively under treatment or follow-up, or presenting with pulmonary symptoms (ie, suspected lung cancer). Nodules detected during lung cancer screening should be managed according to guidance provided by <a href=\"https://www.acr.org/-/media/ACR/Files/RADS/Lung-RADS/LungRADS_AssessmentCategories.pdf?la=en&amp;token=ws4nli/CLc+DS4ie2cbtylxUifh9H3qmJorSp0gbUwbbXEj/7iwOkBt4Gb+CJa8ATuEDkNLnSrP8uKRX7Nk+/PYpE44ff78Vdi46EPkF8krwNjhINCgx0oD9YD8XCD6t&amp;TOPIC_ID=6986\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Lung-RADS</a> (used in the United States) which differs from the approach for incidental nodules.

Some individuals prefer no treatment or suboptimal therapy, especially those with life-limiting comorbid conditions. For others who are risk averse, particularly to potentially curative lobectomy, discussion of alternative noncurative therapies for lung cancer is appropriate. For patients who prefer no therapy, monitoring clinically or with computed tomography (CT) surveillance may be preferred. In contrast, surgical excision may be preferred by those who have a strong desire for diagnostic certainty, are noncompliant with follow-up, and are willing to accept the risks associated with surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1858933503\"><span class=\"h2\">Growing nodule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pulmonary nodule that has clearly grown on serial imaging is likely to be malignant and should be evaluated pathologically.

The rationale for this strategy is based upon the low prevalence of malignancy as well as the procedural difficulty and high risk of tissue biopsy in this population. Any increase in nodule size should prompt redirection of the management strategy toward biopsy or excision. </p><p>Studies that report growth for nodules found on CT suggest that the detection of growth is dependent upon the presence of risk factors in the study population. One retrospective review reported that in patients with no risk factors for lung cancer who had pulmonary nodules &lt;5 mm, no nodules grew over a 3 to 24 month follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In contrast, another study reported growth in 11 percent of nodules during a 24-month period when risk factors for malignancy or extrathoracic malignancies were present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. These studies provide the basis for more aggressive CT surveillance strategies in patients at risk for lung cancer compared with those at low risk. Thus, the frequency with which CT examinations should be performed is determined by the patient's risk for lung cancer as well as by the size of the nodule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/3,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,78</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H513816847\" class=\"local\">'CT surveillance'</a> below.)</p><p>Thus, we suggest the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With a &lt;6 mm solid nodule, further follow-up is not typically required; for a patient with a relevant risk factor for cancer (eg, smoking history), a CT at 12 months is optional, bearing in mind that cancer risk is considerably less than 1 percent even in patients at high risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/12,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,95</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With a 6 to 8 mm solid nodule, a CT should be performed at 6 to 12 months.

If the nodule resolves, no further follow-up is needed. If the nodule grows or develops a solid component, tissue diagnosis should be sought. This approach is based upon the observation that many ground-glass nodules will resolve spontaneously and are presumed to be infectious or inflammatory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].

Each category of nodule is accompanied by an overall estimate of malignancy and guidance for the next step in management. The approach to nodules with Lung-RADS is in many ways analogous to those presented here for incidental nodules. However, there are differences that reflect the higher risk of lung cancer in the patients undergoing screening, including the continuation of annual low-dose CT scans as part of the screening protocol even if no nodules are found on the initial scan. Following the protocol for annual screening also means that patients with solid nodules &lt;6 mm found on screening are followed annually, compared with no follow-up if the nodule were found incidentally. In addition, the pure subsolid (ground-glass) nodules found on screening are followed at one year if they are &lt;20 mm and at six months if they are &ge;20 mm; in contrast, incidental subsolid nodules are not followed if &lt;6 mm and followed at 6 to 12 months if &gt;6 mm.

However, approximately 7 percent of TTNB procedures result in a pneumothorax requiring chest tube drainage. This risk is increased in patients with emphysema, greater distance between pleural surface and lesion, and when the needle crosses a fissure, and when the biopsy needle traverses greater than two pleural surfaces. Thus, TTNB is preferred for biopsy of peripheral nodules, for deeper lesions if fissures do not need to be traversed, and in patients without underlying emphysema. </p><p>Needle (core) <strong>biopsy</strong> techniques are often obtained in addition to needle <strong>aspiration</strong> for both benign and malignant diagnoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/64,117,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,117,119</a>]. The decision to get both is sometimes driven by the availability of intraprocedural cytology. This preference is based upon the need for histologic architecture for benign diagnoses and the observation that although a diagnosis of malignancy can be made on cellular material, larger biopsy samples are often needed for additional immunohistochemical and mutational analysis. </p><p>The most common complication of TTNB is pneumothorax (10 to 17 percent). Hemoptysis occurs less commonly (1 to 9.5 percent) and hemorrhage requiring intervention is very rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/114,115,120-123\" class=\"abstract_t\">114,115,120-123</a>].

For patients who are surgical candidates, a diagnostic wedge resection by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) is the preferred procedure for pulmonary nodules at high risk (&gt;65 percent) or intermediate risk of malignancy when nonsurgical biopsy is nondiagnostic or suspicious for malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/124,125\" class=\"abstract_t\">124,125</a>].

However, for deeper lesions, digital palpation or localization techniques can be performed to increase the diagnostic yield during thoracoscopy. Localization techniques include preoperative placement of a hook wire, fiducials, or microcoils and percutaneous injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>; or intraoperative imaging with technetium-99 radioguidance, ultrasound, or fluoroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/126-130\" class=\"abstract_t\">126-130</a>]. </p><p>The diagnosis is typically established intraoperatively by frozen section analysis after wedge resection. When the diagnosis is consistent with non-small cell carcinoma (NSCLC), the surgery is preferably converted to a VATS lobectomy (or segmentectomy when preservation of lung function is important) with mediastinal node sampling, which is the optimal treatment for early stage NSCLC. The advantage of this approach is that for nodules that are malignant, diagnosis, staging, and therapy are performed in a single operative procedure. However, frozen section pathology is less reliable for lesions &lt;1.1 cm and for specific pathologies, including low grade or pre-cancerous adenocarcinoma (eg, minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, adenocarcinoma in situ, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia) and carcinoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. Thus, when frozen section is initially unrevealing for cancer and subsequently found by routine histology to be definitive for NSCLC, a second surgery (completion lobectomy) may be required for treatment.
