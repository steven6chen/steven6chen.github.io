No randomized clinical trials have evaluated the effectiveness of bilateral CEA for such patients. However, bilateral carotid occlusive disease appears to increase the risk for complications during and after unilateral CEA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. As an example, in one study of 700 patients undergoing CEA, 15.4 percent had contralateral disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The combined death and stroke rates in these patients were almost twice that of matched patients with unilateral disease (5.6 versus 2.4 percent).</p><p>The impact of severe contralateral carotid artery stenosis or occlusion on the benefit and risk of unilateral CEA in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic disease is discussed separately in the appropriate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease&quot;, section on 'Contralateral carotid stenosis or occlusion'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease#H1424721199\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of asymptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease&quot;, section on 'Contralateral carotid stenosis or occlusion'</a>.)</p><p>The risks associated with respiratory compromise secondary to neck hematomas or recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, frequent difficulty with blood pressure control after manipulation of the carotid sinus, concerns about cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome and the unknown effect of bilateral cerebral ischemia (although temporary) generally contraindicate a combined approach. (See <a href=\"#H93838577\" class=\"local\">'Perioperative morbidity and mortality'</a> below.)</p><p>When the extent of contralateral carotid disease is significant enough to warrant bilateral CEA, most surgeons stage the approach. When one side is symptomatic and the other asymptomatic, the symptomatic lesion is generally addressed first and the asymptomatic side addressed once the patient has recovered from the first CEA. If both sides are asymptomatic and of similar severity, the lesion supplying the dominant hemisphere is addressed first. When one lesion is significantly worse than the other and both are asymptomatic, the lesion of greater severity is addressed first and the second later as a staged procedure. Vocal cord paralysis following the first procedure should be ruled out by otolaryngologic examination prior to performing the second procedure. (See <a href=\"#H101623404\" class=\"local\">'Laryngoscopy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83593145\"><span class=\"h3\">Prophylactic carotid endarterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prophylactic carotid intervention in patients with severe carotid artery stenosis prior to another surgery is rarely needed, and a decision to proceed should be individualized depending upon the clinician's best estimate of the risk of perioperative stroke. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93838471\"><span class=\"h4\">Coronary artery bypass surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurologic complications are second only to heart failure as a cause of morbidity and mortality following cardiac surgery. New stroke or transient ischemic attack occurs in approximately 3 percent of patients following CABG. As a result, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is often considered in conjunction with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with significant carotid stenosis. However, there have been no trials examining the use of CEA in patients having CABG. In addition, it is not clear if CABG should be combined with CEA or should be staged (ie, performed before or after CEA). Whether to offer prophylactic CEA before or after CABG is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-in-patients-with-cerebrovascular-disease#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with cerebrovascular disease&quot;, section on 'Prophylactic carotid intervention'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93838478\"><span class=\"h4\">General surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of stroke appears to be lower following general (nonvascular) surgical procedures than following cardiac surgery, with a reported incidence in patients undergoing general anesthesia of less than 0.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. The risk may be slightly higher (1 percent) in asymptomatic patients with a carotid bruit who undergo general surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>There have been no randomized trials examining the use of prophylactic CEA in patients with carotid stenosis prior to general surgery. A retrospective review suggests that prophylactic CEA is probably not warranted in most patients with asymptomatic carotid disease to lower their risk of perioperative stroke as a complication of their anticipated general surgical procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This study was a chart review of 284 patients who had undergone nonvascular surgery requiring general anesthesia and had preoperative carotid ultrasound. While a previous history of stroke or TIA, a carotid bruit, or both were present in 250 patients, all were considered to have asymptomatic carotid stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Ten of 284 patients (3.5 percent) had perioperative ischemic strokes within 30 days of the index procedure, and 8 of 224 (3.6 percent) with &gt;50 percent carotid stenosis had an ipsilateral perioperative stroke (bilateral lesions were present in three patients). While this stroke risk exceeds that of the general population and of patients with carotid bruits, the increased risk appears to be insufficient to mandate prophylactic CEA for asymptomatic carotid stenosis in the general surgical population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83593195\"><span class=\"h4\">Vascular procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are no trials of prophylactic CEA prior to abdominal aortic aneurysm repair or other major peripheral vascular procedures, many vascular surgeons support performing prophylactic CEA in those patients with appropriate indications for CEA, in anticipation of a major vascular procedure that may involve significant hemodynamic fluctuations. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83592089\"><span class=\"h3\">Endarterectomy in patients with intracranial aneurysm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ipsilateral intracranial aneurysms that are distal to a cervical internal carotid artery stenosis may be susceptible to sudden hemodynamic changes associated with CEA leading to aneurysm rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. On the other hand, surgical clipping of an aneurysm distal to a severe internal carotid stenosis may increase the risk of ischemic stroke.</p><p>Unfortunately, data are too sparse to allow firm conclusions as to which problem should be treated first. However, caution is advised if CEA is performed in this setting, especially if the ipsilateral aneurysm is &ge;7 mm in diameter or if there is a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage from another aneurysm.

A search can be made for evidence of atherosclerotic disease elsewhere, including abdominal aortic aneurysm and peripheral artery disease. The cost effectiveness and medical benefit of screening under such circumstances is unknown.

Advances in perioperative management have led at least some surgeons to conclude that among patients with appropriate indications for CEA, the proportion of patients with an unacceptable surgical risk is extremely small and continues to shrink [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. In one large database study, the investigators noted that morbidity and mortality had declined by 36 percent during the last five years of the study compared with the previous five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Modifications in surgical practice, refinement of anesthetic techniques and alternatives, refinements in the use of vasoactive medications in the perioperative period, and the declining use of routine preoperative contrast angiography may be responsible for the observed reduction in perioperative complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. For patients deemed unfit for general anesthesia, regional anesthesia is an alternative shown to have equally good perioperative outcomes in patients with and without certain risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

However, a large database review that included all carotid interventions from New York performed between 2000 and 2009 (27,439 women and 36,295 men) found a higher rate of stroke and acute myocardial infarction for asymptomatic women undergoing carotid intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Two large database reviews support the above risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/27,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,32</a>]. The later and larger of these included 3845 patients from the 2012 CEA-targeted American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database undergoing CEA for asymptomatic disease in 58.1 percent, and symptomatic disease in 41.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The overall 30-day postoperative <span class=\"nowrap\">stroke/death</span> rate was 3.0 percent (asymptomatic: 1.9 percent; symptomatic: 4.6 percent). Two factors in asymptomatic patients (contralateral 80 to 99 percent ICA stenosis, ASA Physical Status Classification 4 or 5), and four factors in symptomatic patients (contralateral 80 to 99 percent ICA stenosis, preoperative stroke, emergency procedure, physiologic high-risk characteristic [age &gt;80 years, renal failure, severe chronic lung disease, and requirement for aortocoronary bypass or cardiac valve surgery &le;30 days]) were independently associated with an increased incidence of postoperative (30-day) <span class=\"nowrap\">stroke/death</span>. These factors were noted to be generally related to the comorbidities of the patient and specific characteristics of their carotid disease, rather than technical features of the CEA procedure. Factors associated with nonstroke 30 day postoperative major morbidity included non-independent functional health status, operative time &ge;150 minutes, age &ge;80 years, ASA Physical Status Classification 4 or 5, bleeding disorder, anatomic high-risk factor, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and preoperative beta blocker use.</p><p>Although the specific factors that increase perioperative risk following CEA remain debated, patients deemed to be high risk have worse long-term outcomes following CEA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/12,23,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,23,53</a>]. In a retrospective review of 625 patients that compared patients at high risk (anatomic and pathophysiologic) with normal risk patients, no significant differences were found for perioperative outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

However, there is no evidence that immediate cardiac intervention alone reduces perioperative procedural risk of stroke or death for carotid endarterectomy.

However, a chest radiograph for most patients prior to carotid endarterectomy may be justified due to the association of carotid atherosclerosis with smoking and coronary heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

Other useful noninvasive methods to assess the degree of stenosis of the internal carotid artery include computed tomography angiography, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography. The utility of these noninvasive methods and cerebral angiography in the initial evaluation of carotid stenosis is discussed in detail separately.

In support of this point of view is a lack of uniformly applied, prospectively-validated criteria in some settings for quantifying the degree of internal carotid artery stenosis with duplex ultrasound. Against this point of view are the disadvantages, risks, and costs associated with other imaging modalities such as catheter-based angiography; magnetic resonance angiography, which tends to overestimate the degree of stenosis; and computed tomographic angiography, which may underestimate the degree of stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>].

The recommendations are by consensus and further state that the utility of the recommendations should be verified in individual vascular laboratories, and the suggested parameters should not replace duplex parameters that are locally well documented as providing accurate assessment of carotid stenosis. As such, it may be reasonable for the surgeon who has access to a certified vascular laboratory with ongoing quality assurance programs and staffed by registered vascular technologists to use duplex ultrasound as a sole imaging modality of the cervical internal carotid artery prior to performing carotid endarterectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83592233\"><span class=\"h3\">Brain imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the symptomatic patient, the preoperative evaluation should also include computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to assess the degree of cerebral infarction, if any, and to exclude other disorders that might be responsible for symptoms (eg, subdural hematoma, tumor).</p><p>The added risk and costs of catheter-based arteriography probably outweigh the benefit of obtaining more anatomic detail. The Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) found a 1.6 percent incidence of stroke associated with routine arteriography, although the risk was less in other reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. However, arteriography is the gold standard for evaluating intracranial atherosclerotic disease, which is present, to some degree in many patients with stenosis of the extracranial internal carotid artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>].</p><p>In an analysis of a subset of patients from NASCET, the relative risk of stroke associated with intracranial atherosclerotic disease in medically-treated patients was 1.3 for extracranial stenosis &lt;50 percent, and 1.8 for extracranial stenosis 85 to 99 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. CEA reduced this risk, suggesting that detection of intracranial atherosclerotic disease, particularly in those with moderate extracranial carotid stenosis, may help stratify patients into a group that is more likely to achieve benefit from CEA. Of the available noninvasive tests (ie, transcranial Doppler, CTA, MRA), CTA may be more accurate for identifying intracranial large artery stenosis.

In its distal (cranial) course, it passes beneath the hypoglossal nerve, the digastric muscle, the stylohyoid muscle, the occipital artery, and the posterior auricular artery.

The carotid sinus baroreceptors are located within the adventitia of the origin of the internal carotid artery and are innervated by the sinus nerve of Hering, which is a branch of glossopharyngeal nerve. In response to low blood pressure, the nerve fibers decrease their firing rates stimulating the sympathetic nervous system and inhibiting of the parasympathetic nervous system via a centrally-acting mechanism. Carotid sinus reactivity may be altered in patients with carotid atherosclerosis.

Endarterectomy, removal of atheromatous debris, and reconstruction of the carotid artery may increase tension on the carotid sinus baroreceptor, increasing its activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. The opposite is also possible if damage to the carotid sinus or sinus nerve occurs. As an example, eversion endarterectomy requires division of the carotid artery, and as a result, the longitudinal fibers of the carotid sinus nerve are transected. A study that measured baroreceptor sensitivity following CEA found increased sensitivity with conventional CEA and decreased sensitivity with an eversion technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Correspondingly, postoperative blood pressures were significantly increased for eversion compared with conventional CEA (systolic: 127, diastolic: 64, mean: 86; versus systolic: 111, diastolic: 55, mean: 75). Compensation over time occurs due to intact baroreceptor mechanisms from the contralateral side and aortic arch.

Blood pressure in the perioperative period is affected by the method of anesthesia. General anesthesia reduces blood pressure during anesthesia induction and may require the use of pressor agents.

No significant differences were found for other measures, including myocardial infarction, postoperative bleeding, pulmonary complications, or length of stay. In the NSQIP study above, adjusted analysis identified general anesthesia as a risk factor for postoperative myocardial infarction (odds ratio 2.18, 95% CI 1.17-4.04) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A post-hoc analysis of the GALA trial found that local anesthesia may be more cost-effective than general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. The difference in cost was primarily due to differences in the length of intensive care unit stay and the use of consumables, with a mean cost difference of &#8356;178 ($285 US). Two other nonrandomized studies have similarly suggested a cost difference between the two anesthesia techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/87,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,91</a>].

The most commonly used methods are discussed in detail elsewhere. The author prefers EEG monitoring.

For the latter incision, preoperative imaging and palpation of the neck will guide the surgeon to the optimal placement of the incision. No significant differences between these approaches have been identified in terms of stroke, wound complications, or nerve complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p>The underlying platysma muscle and subcutaneous tissues are divided, the carotid sheath exposed, and the internal carotid artery (ICA) is carefully identified and dissected. The extent of exposure of the artery is dependent upon the distribution of disease determined by intraoperative findings. Typically, dissection is needed from the common carotid artery (CCA) to a point distal to the bifurcation of the ICA and ECA that is beyond palpable ICA plaque to allow for clamping of normal soft artery. </p><p>After proximal and distal control of the artery is obtained, the patient is given a bolus of heparin, intravenously. Monitoring of the activated clotting time (ACT) is not usually needed owing to the short duration of carotid clamping, typically less than an hour. </p><p>Carotid stump pressures can be obtained after clamping the proximal common and external carotid arteries. A needle attached to a transducer is introduced into the common carotid artery to obtain a waveform. Mean pressures greater than 30 to 50 mmHg imply adequate collateralization via the circle of Willis down the ipsilateral carotid artery. Lower stump pressures are an indication for shunt placement and higher pressures are associated with stroke rates &lt;0.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Critics of this technique caution that pressures are only obtained after initial clamping, and, therefore, represent a &quot;snapshot&quot; in time. In addition, the criteria above should be used with caution in patients who have suffered prior ipsilateral strokes since there is a poor correlation between adequate perfusion pressures and outcomes in this setting. The accuracy of the pressure in the face of a preocclusive (string) lesion may also be questionable. (See <a href=\"#H22422514\" class=\"local\">'Assessing brain perfusion'</a> above.) </p><p>The internal, common, and external arteries are then clamped sequentially; the internal carotid artery is usually clamped first to prevent embolization. Manipulation of the carotid bulb during carotid endarterectomy not infrequently results in hemodynamic instability intraoperatively and in the early postoperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Adequate cerebral perfusion pressure should be maintained during periods of hemodynamic instability to avoid low cerebral blood flow and cerebral ischemia. </p><p>A longitudinal arteriotomy is performed below the level of the bifurcation and extended proximally and distally. With general anesthesia and mandatory shunting, the shunt is placed after the vessel is opened and prior to the endarterectomy. For patients who are undergoing general anesthesia, some surgeons routinely place a carotid shunt while others use cerebral perfusion monitoring to guide the need for selective shunt placement. For these patients and those undergoing awake carotid endarterectomy using local anesthesia (with or without cervical block), the endarterectomy is often completed prior to the need to place a shunt, as indicated by brain monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H22422128\" class=\"local\">'Carotid shunting'</a> below and <a href=\"#H22422514\" class=\"local\">'Assessing brain perfusion'</a> above.)</p><p>The carotid plaque, which is consistently found at the carotid bifurcation and the origin of the internal carotid artery, is then freed and removed through a dissection plane developed in the layers of the deep media. Great care is taken to create a smoothly tapered transition between the endarterectomized portion of the artery and its normal distal extent. This maneuver avoids intimal flaps that might lead to arterial dissection after flow is reestablished. Some surgeons will place &quot;tacking sutures&quot; at the distal end of the endarterectomy to further guard against possible dissection of the distal internal carotid artery following restoration of blood flow.</p><p>After meticulous inspection of the endarterectomized surface to remove any residual plaque or debris, attention is directed at repair. Some surgeons choose to repair primarily, while others patch the artery with saphenous vein or prosthetic material such as polyester (eg, Dacron), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, eg, Gore-Tex), or bovine pericardium. There is evidence that routine patch use lowers the risk of perioperative carotid thrombosis, stroke, and late restenosis of the endarterectomy site. (See <a href=\"#H93838549\" class=\"local\">'Patch angioplasty versus primary closure'</a> below.)</p><p>Just prior to completion of the arterial closure, the carotid clamps are sequentially briefly released and re-clamped to back bleed (ECA, ICA) and forward flush (CCA) the vessel which is then irrigated with heparinized saline and suctioned of any residual debris. After the suture line is completed, flow is restored first to the ECA, then to the ICA. </p><p>A topical hemostatic agent may be used over the suture line to slow any oozing of blood. The only randomized trial comparing protamine with no protamine found significantly lower rates of wound drainage, but cautioned that protamine might increase the risk for carotid thrombosis and stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. In a retrospective analysis of 4587 patients in a regional registry, reversal of heparin with protamine was associated with a lower incidence of serious bleeding requiring reoperation (0.64 versus 1.7 percent) compared with no reversal, without increasing the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. A later systematic review that included the randomized trial, the registry study, and 10 other observational studies, similarly found no significant differences for stroke (9 studies), myocardial infarction (3 studies), or mortality (7 studies) for those who received protamine compared with those who did not; however, protamine use significantly decreased the risk of major bleeding complications requiring reoperation (relative risk [RR] 0.57; 95% CI 0.39-0.84) (10 studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. Dosing of heparin (fixed dosing, per body weight), dosing of protamine, and use of monitoring via ACT varied across the studies, and could not be adequately evaluated. A subgroup analysis suggested that stroke risk may be higher for primary carotid closure compared with patch closure when using protamine, but the overall number of events was small, limiting the ability to draw a firm conclusion.</p><p>Although a small Jackson Pratt drain can be placed, drains are generally not required and have not been shown to definitively reduce the rates of significant postoperative incisional hematomas.

The nerve is isolated and gently retracted. </p><p>The ansa hypoglossus nerve, which innervates the strap muscles of the neck, is typically seen coursing along the carotid sheath. The ansa can be divided without clinically significant consequence when dissection needs to be carried more cranially. The posterior belly of the digastric muscle can also be divided.

The internal carotid artery is transected horizontally at its origin at the carotid bulb and then the artery is everted, or turned inside-out, which creates an exposure not seen with vertical arteriotomy. A modification of the technique that uses a linear incision over the common carotid artery and proximal internal carotid artery has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. Eversion endarterectomy is particularly appealing in small arteries and in patients with significant carotid redundancy as a means to eliminate carotid kinks and coils. However, in our opinion, the bulk of the evidence does not favor one technique over the other.</p><p>The largest and best designed trial comparing eversion endarterectomy with conventional endarterectomy (EVEREST trial) was a multicenter trial that included 1342 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. No significant differences were found for the primary endpoints (perioperative stroke and death, carotid occlusion) or secondary endpoints (any stroke, ipsilateral stroke, transient ischemic attack, cranial nerve injury, neck hematoma, myocardial infarction). For eversion CEA compared with conventional CEA, the odds ratio for a combined endpoint of perioperative major stroke or death was 1.0 (95% CI 0.4-2.9), and for any perioperative stroke, 1.2 (95% CI 0.5-2.7). Compared with CEA performed without a patch, eversion CEA and conventional patched CEA each had a lower risk of carotid restenosis (hazard ratio [HR] 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.6, and HR 0.2, 95% CI 0.07-0.6, respectively). A metaanalysis that included the EVEREST trial and five other smaller trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/113-119\" class=\"abstract_t\">113-119</a>] identified a trend toward a reduced risk of perioperative (30-day) stroke for eversion CEA compared with conventional CEA (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33-0.96) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. Among the included randomized trials, one single-center trial found a significantly reduced risk for perioperative stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]; the other trials found no significant differences between the techniques. In this trial, perioperative stroke occurred in 2.9 percent of patients undergoing conventional CEA and no patient undergoing eversion endarterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. Two of the four strokes involved the contralateral hemisphere, not necessarily related to endarterectomy technique, and the other two strokes were related to angulation at the interface of the artery and the patch material. </p><p>Randomized trials and other observational studies that have evaluated conventional versus eversion CEA have included patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. A post hoc analysis of data from the Stent-Protected Angioplasty versus Carotid Endarterectomy in Symptomatic Patients (SPACE-1) trial found no overall difference between the techniques; however, perioperative outcomes were better for conventional CEA, while later outcomes favored eversion CEA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. Ipsilateral stroke or death &le;30 days was significantly reduced for conventional versus eversion CEA (9 versus 3 percent), but the risk of ipsilateral stroke &gt;30 days was significantly lower for eversion compared with conventional CEA (3 versus 0 percent). Interestingly, eversion CEA was not found to have a significantly lower incidence of restenosis in contrast to other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/120,123\" class=\"abstract_t\">120,123</a>]. </p><p>Proponents of eversion CEA feel that once the technique has been mastered, it may be easier to perform than conventional CEA. Although this may be so, advocates of conventional CEA point out that shunt insertion during eversion CEA can be more difficult since the plaque must be completely removed before the shunt can be inserted. In addition, eversion CEA is less commonly introduced during vascular surgery training and, for those who adopt it later, the technique may be associated with a learning curve. A retrospective review at an academic medical center compared the outcomes of the first 100 patients on whom they performed eversion endarterectomy with 100 patients who underwent conventional endarterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. The rate of perioperative neurologic deficits and deaths were not significantly different. One case of amaurosis occurred after eversion CEA, and one case each of transient cerebral ischemia and retinal infarction after conventional CEA; one cardiac death occurred with each. No significant differences were seen in the rate of critical (&gt;80 percent) residual or recurrent stenosis, late stroke, or late carotid occlusion at 36 months follow-up. However, eversion endarterectomy had a higher rate of &gt;50 percent recurrent stenosis (38 versus 6 percent) compared with conventional CEA in spite of similar residual stenosis rates. The significance of this late mild to moderate stenosis is unknown. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93838549\"><span class=\"h3\">Patch angioplasty versus primary closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, some surgeons choose to repair to the carotid artery primarily, while others patch the artery with saphenous vein or material (eg, polytetrafluoroethylene, Dacron, bovine pericardium) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/125-129\" class=\"abstract_t\">125-129</a>]. We recommend patch closure for all patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (non-eversion).</p><p>The trials that have been performed suggest two benefits from use of a patch: a marked reduction in the frequency of &ge;50 percent restenosis and a lower rate of ipsilateral stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/130,131\" class=\"abstract_t\">130,131</a>]. A systematic review of patch angioplasty versus primary closure during CEA identified 10 eligible randomized controlled trials involving 1967 patients undergoing 2157 operations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. Many of the trials were limited by significant methodological flaws; most were small, and none could be analyzed on a true intention-to-treat basis because of losses to follow-up. The use of a patch is associated with: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction in the risk of ipsilateral stroke in the perioperative period (odds ratio [OR] 0.31, 95% CI 0.1-0.63 and long-term OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.16-0.63).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reduced risk of perioperative arterial occlusion (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.08-0.41).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased restenosis during long-term follow-up in eight trials (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.17-0.34). These results are more certain than those of the previous review since the number of operations and events have increased. However, the sample sizes are still relatively small, data were not available from all trials, and there was significant loss to follow-up. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No significant correlation was found between use of patch angioplasty and the risk of either perioperative or long-term all-cause death rates.</p><p/><p>A separate systematic review identified 13 trials involving 2083 operations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>]. Seven trials compared vein patch closure with PTFE patch closure and six trials compared Dacron patches with other synthetic materials. No significant differences were found comparing synthetic patches versus vein patches for stroke, stroke or death, arterial occlusion, arterial rupture, nerve palsy, wound infection, or recurrent arterial stenosis during perioperative or one-year follow-up. The review identified one high-quality trial that compared Dacron with PTFE patches and found that Dacron patches were associated with an increased risk for perioperative stroke and an increased risk for both perioperative and late recurrent carotid stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/126,127\" class=\"abstract_t\">126,127</a>]. </p><p>Using a synthetic patch was found to decrease the risk of pseudoaneurysm relative to using a vein patch (odds ratio 0.09, 95% CI, 0.02-0.49). However, the studies that examined pseudoaneurysm outcomes were older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/132-134\" class=\"abstract_t\">132-134</a>], using saphenous vein, jugular vein, or other vein sites; the technical aspects of vein handling were not included. In one of these studies, the incidence of pseudoaneurysm was 17 percent using jugular vein, 9 percent using saphenous vein or PTFE, and 5 percent with primary closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>]. The use of vein during initial open carotid endarterectomy has declined, but when vein is needed (eg, graft infection, re-do carotid surgery), we prefer to use proximal saphenous vein harvested from the groin. A later trial comparing PTFE (Acuseal) with bovine pericardium also found no significant differences between these materials for ipsilateral stroke, recurrent carotid stenosis, or other perioperative complications (eg, neck hematoma); mean hemostasis time was slightly lower for the PTFE patch.</p><p>Very few arterial complications, including hemorrhage, infection, cranial nerve palsies, and pseudo-aneurysm formation, have been evaluated with patch compared with primary closure but the available data suggest no significant differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22422128\"><span class=\"h2\">Carotid shunting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although carotid stump pressures were used to determine the need for carotid shunting in the past, EEG (raw or processed) is more commonly used in patients undergoing general anesthesia to monitor brain perfusion. A neurologist monitors the tracings during the course of the procedure for cerebral ischemia as indicated by the presence of theta and delta waves or disorganized rhythms that indicate the need for shunting. (See <a href=\"#H22422514\" class=\"local\">'Assessing brain perfusion'</a> above.)</p><p>If the patient demonstrates evidence of cerebral ischemia by any neuromonitoring technique, shunting should be performed expeditiously. Shunt placement is indicated for awake patients who develop agitation, slurred speech, disorientation, or extremity weakness, or the presence of theta and delta waves or disorganized rhythms on EEG monitoring in the patient who is asleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>]. A temporary shunt is placed beyond the proximal and distal extent of the arteriotomy from the common to the internal carotid artery. Blood flows through the shunt providing continuous cerebral perfusion during the procedure. Neurologic reassessment is performed again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22422183\"><span class=\"h3\">Routine versus selective shunting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies targeted at defining the best approach (mandatory shunting, selective shunting) have been equivocal with respect to demonstrating any difference in important clinical outcomes. Given that there is no consensus, neurologic monitoring with selective shunting versus routine shunting has been largely a matter of surgeon preference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/92,137-140\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,137-140</a>]. When a shunt is used, the distal end is placed first into the internal carotid artery and the shunt back-bled to wash out any debris within the shunt prior to placing it into the common carotid artery and restoring cerebral perfusion. To minimize trapping debris within the shunt, it is mandatory to place the shunt in relatively disease-free segments of the internal and common carotid arteries.</p><p>Surgeons who routinely shunt feel that shunt complications are less likely to occur if shunting is routinely performed. The advantages of routine shunting may include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Familiarity of the surgeon and surgical team with the technique &ndash; Data from the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE) database found that surgeons who routinely shunted had lower stroke rates during carotid endarterectomy in patients with contralateral carotid occlusion compared with those who selectively shunted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>]. The higher rate of stroke amongst practitioners who selectively shunted may be attributable to a lack of familiarity with the procedure. Other groups have also reported a higher rate of shunting in patients with contralateral carotid occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/142,143\" class=\"abstract_t\">142,143</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebral flow is assured with a properly placed shunt without need for neurological monitoring (EEG, stump pressure, awake neurological examination).</p><p/><p>Although some surgeons prefer to use carotid shunts routinely to avoid the need for intraoperative neuromonitoring, it should be recognized that shunting is unnecessary in approximately 90 percent of patients. Proponents of carotid shunting argue that selective shunting exposes patients to the risks of shunting that may include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Formation of an intimal flap during shunt insertion, resulting in arterial dissection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dislodgement of plaque emboli during vessel manipulation </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Air embolism due to bubbles in the shunt</p><p/><p>With awake carotid endarterectomy, a carotid shunt is needed in &lt;5 percent of patients.

Surgeons are encouraged to keep accurate records of their individual stroke rates to ensure that standards are upheld. Low patient volume (&lt;3 CEAs performed every two years) and a greater number of years since licensure of the surgeon are associated with worse outcomes following CEA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/150,151\" class=\"abstract_t\">150,151</a>].</p><p>A retrospective review of the United States Medicare database evaluated outcomes of 454,717 CEA and 27,943 carotid artery stenting (CAS) patients before and after the 2005 National Coverage Determination to reimburse CAS for Medicare beneficiaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-endarterectomy/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>]. CEA rates declined from 18.1 to 12.7 per 10,000 beneficiaries between 2002 and 2008 (overall rates also declined).

(See <a href=\"#H93838527\" class=\"local\">'Statins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend antibiotic prophylaxis prior to carotid endarterectomy to reduce the risk of surgical site infection due to the frequent use of prosthetic material (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Antibiotics should be discontinued within 24 hours. (See <a href=\"#H83592851\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carotid endarterectomy can be performed using general anesthesia or local anesthesia (with or without cervical block). Statistically significant differences for major endpoints (perioperative stroke, myocardial infarction, and death) have not been consistently shown for differing anesthetic approaches. The choice of anesthesia technique is largely dependent on the preferences of the patient, the anesthesiologist, and the surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H83592649\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No one technique for plaque removal has been found to be superior over another with respect to the incidence of stroke, death, or other morbidity. As with many surgical techniques, one technique may be preferable to another for specific circumstances and the choice of technique is largely dependent on the preferences and experience of the surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H83592614\" class=\"local\">'Endarterectomy procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to carotid artery clamping, the patient is systemically anticoagulated. At the completion of the procedure, we suggest reversal of heparin with protamine over no reversal (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H83592614\" class=\"local\">'Endarterectomy procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following carotid plaque removal, we recommend patch closure of the carotid artery over no patch (non-eversion technique) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). With conventional CEA, carotid patch techniques are associated with decreased rates of stroke and carotid restenosis. No one patch material (synthetic, vein, bovine pericardium) has been shown to be superior over another.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the completion of the procedure, the patient's neurologic status and blood pressure are carefully monitored. We keep the systolic blood pressure between 100 and 150 mmHg. Hypotension and hypertension are both associated with adverse outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H83592498\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The perioperative mortality associated with CEA ranges from &lt;0.5 to 3 percent. Complications associated with carotid endarterectomy include perioperative complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke, hyperperfusion syndrome, nerve injury, parotitis and bleeding, which can lead to neck hematoma requiring reoperation, and late carotid restenosis. (See <a href=\"#H93838577\" class=\"local\">'Perioperative morbidity and mortality'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-carotid-endarterectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of carotid endarterectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H436955615\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We are saddened by the death of Emile R Mohler, III, MD, who passed away in October 2017.
