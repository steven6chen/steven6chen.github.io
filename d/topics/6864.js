It is a result of either inadequate development (congenital) or atrophy (acquired) of the diaphragm.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of diaphragmatic eventration in infants will be discussed here. Eventration of the diaphragm in adults is discussed separately.

In this cohort, the diagnosis was made in 26 neonates, 17 infants between one month to one year of age, and the remaining 26 patients between 1 to 17 years of age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the second study from a single Chinese tertiary center of 177 patients with <strong>congenital</strong> eventration of the diaphragm from 2000 to 2011, the diagnosis was made by three months in 71 patients (40 percent), from three months to one year in 58 patients (33 percent), and the remaining 41 patients between 1 to 18 years of age (23 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p>Case series demonstrate a male predominance with boys accounting for two-thirds of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Congenital eventrations can either be an isolated defect or be associated with other developmental defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15294033\" class=\"local\">'Congenital eventration'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eventration of the diaphragm can be congenital or acquired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/1,3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-5</a>]. In the previously mentioned large case series from the United States, two-thirds of the cases were due to congenital eventration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15294033\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital eventration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital eventration results from inadequate development of the diaphragmatic muscle or absence of the phrenic nerve. All or part of the diaphragmatic muscle is replaced by fibroelastic tissue resulting in either total (diffuse) or partial involvement of the diaphragm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/1,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6-8</a>]. The diaphragm retains its continuity and attachments to the costal margin. However, the weakened hemidiaphragm is displaced into the thorax, which can compromise breathing due to lung compression by abdominal contents.</p><p>Partial defects occur in two-thirds of congenital cases, and most commonly affect the right hemidiaphragm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>In patients with total or diffuse eventration, the defect tends to be unilateral and there is no difference in involvement between the two sides. In total congenital eventration, the diaphragm consists of a thin, diaphanous membrane that is attached peripherally to normal muscle. In contrast, the continuity between the diaphragm and the costal margin is disrupted in patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia.</p><p>In patients with congenital eventration, the incidence is two- to threefold greater in males than in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Congenital eventrations can be isolated, although they sometimes are associated with other developmental defects such as hypoplastic lung, cleft palate, congenital heart disease (CHD), situs inversus, or urogenital abnormalities (eg, undescended testicles) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15294039\"><span class=\"h2\">Acquired eventration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of acquired eventration is injury to the phrenic nerve, resulting from either traumatic birth or thoracic surgery for CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. In these patients, the central tendon is normal and the diaphragm consists of normally-developed muscle. The loss of contractility leads to muscle atrophy with elevation of the hemidiaphragm and a small phrenic nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Both sides are affected equally. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diaphragmatic-paralysis-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diaphragmatic paralysis in the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When birth trauma is the underlying etiology, patients may also have brachial nerve palsy due to stretching of the nerve roots as a concomitant finding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-brachial-plexus-palsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal brachial plexus palsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited data from case series demonstrate a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations varying from patients who are asymptomatic to those with severe respiratory distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/1,2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4</a>]. The most common manifestations involve the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Patients with partial defects usually have mild or no significant findings, whereas those with complete defects will have significant respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Typically, the most severely affected patients present as neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The decisions regarding the need for intervention is based on the severity of clinical findings and their effects on the ability of the infant to feed and gain weight.</p><p>Asymptomatic patients present with an incidental finding of an elevated hemidiaphragm on a frontal or lateral view of a chest radiograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51466\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51466 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F108271\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108271 \">image 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1707984548\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory findings vary and include tachypnea, respiratory distress, use of accessory muscles of respiration, and cyanosis. Hypoxemia may result from several associated conditions, including lung hypoplasia, <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> mismatch due to atelectasis or pneumonia, or pulmonary hypertension with right-to-left intracardiac or ductal shunting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/1,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,10</a>]. Clinical severity increases with increasing compromise of lung function due to associated pulmonary hypoplasia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> compression by abdominal contents that extrude into the hemithorax causing atelectasis. In the most severe cases, respiratory failure may require mechanical ventilation. There is also an increased risk of recurrent lower lobe bronchopneumonia due to regional lung compression and atelectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/2,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H444353298\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrointestinal findings are more common for infants with complete defects and include vomiting and failure to thrive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In one case series of 69 patients, gastric volvulus was diagnosed in three patients who presented with repeated episodes of vomiting, poor feeding, and inadequate weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In these cases, the left-sided large defect allowed the stomach to rise above the elevated diaphragm resulting in rotation of the gastric fundus. In some cases, there may be a scaphoid abdomen accompanied by bulging of the hemithorax as abdominal contents migrate into the hemithorax.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of eventration is typically made when a hemidiaphragm appears elevated on a frontal or lateral view on chest radiograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51466\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51466 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F108271\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108271 \">image 2</a>). This usually occurs when a chest radiograph is being performed in a patient with respiratory distress or occasionally, as an incidental finding in an asymptomatic patient in whom a chest radiograph is being performed for another reason. The lateral view should demonstrate that the anterior and posterior diaphragmatic attachments are in the correct positions. Other radiographic findings that may be seen include atelectasis, elevated dome of the liver (right-sided involvement), and elevation of the stomach (left-sided involvement).</p><p>If there is uncertainty of the diagnosis, ultrasound can be used to confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating diaphragm movement during breathing is minimal or paradoxical, rising with inspiration and falling with expiration. Although dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is a diagnostic modality that holds some promise in the diagnosis of this condition, its lack of portability, time to complete the study, and cost are still obstacles that preclude its utility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15294429\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevation of the hemidiaphragm also occurs in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. However, the lateral chest radiograph may demonstrate the anterior and posterior diaphragmatic attachments are in the correct positions distinguishing diaphragmatic eventration from herniation. In addition, there are similar radiographic findings in patients between the two conditions including cardiomediastinal shift, abnormal position of the stomach, and the appearance of bowel contents in the thorax and no bowel gas in the abdomen. Ultrasound may be useful in differentiating the two conditions, since the ultrasonographer is usually able to distinguish between an intact <span class=\"nowrap\">diaphragm/diaphragmatic</span> tissue with an eventration and a defect in the diaphragm in patients with a diaphragmatic hernia with protruding bowel. However, the results of the study may not always be definitive, and thus the diagnosis in these unresolved cases is only made with direct visualization in the operating room.</p><p>Pulmonary sequestration and congenital pulmonary airway malformations may be considered as well; however, these entities are more likely to appear as lung masses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchopulmonary-sequestration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchopulmonary sequestration&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital pulmonary airway (cystic adenomatoid) malformation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fryns syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], trisomy 18 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] are also associated with congenital diaphragmatic eventration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4324701\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, most patients with severe defects present as neonates. Management initially focuses on supportive medical care with pulmonary function stabilization and administration of adequate nutrition. Initial medical management may be sufficient with resolution of symptoms and surgical repair not necessary particularly in patients with partial defects. However, a subgroup of patients will require surgical intervention due to persistent respiratory symptoms, poor growth due to inadequate intake, and significant gastrointestinal complications (eg, gastric volvulus).</p><p>The following management approach primarily focuses on patients who present as neonates as they are the most likely group of patients to present with symptoms and severe disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26319735\"><span class=\"h3\">Medical management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General supportive care during the initial hospitalization includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory support &ndash; Management is based on the infant's respiratory status.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Oxygen supplementation is provided to maintain target oxygen levels between 90 to 95 percent for preterm infants and above 95 percent for term infants. The initial supplementation of oxygen is provided through nasal cannula or hood. In our center, we commonly provide heated, humidified oxygen by nasal cannula at a low flow of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> or less.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For infants who require oxygen supplementation with FiO<sub>2</sub> (fraction of inspired oxygen) concentration greater than 30 percent, additional respiratory support may be needed, by either the use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP, 6 to 8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O pressure) or high-flow, heated, humidified nasal cannula (HFHHNC) with a flow rate between 4 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span>.

For this group of patients, there appears to be little benefit in postponing diaphragmatic plication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/5,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15</a>]. In particular, surgical plication is likely to benefit infants who respond to CPAP, as both interventions stabilize the diaphragm and increase functional residual capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infants with inadequate nutritional intake after initiation of medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/5,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15</a>].

Most pediatric surgeons would prefer to wait four weeks after injury before moving to plication. For these patients, the above indications for surgical plication apply at the end of this four week time period.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26319769\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical plication</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2122566629\"><span class=\"h4\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical repair consists of superimposed rows of plicated sutures designed to take up the slack in the diaphragm and fix it to a lower position. This results in a flattened dome of the diaphragm, which increases resting lung volume and improves action of the intercostal and abdominal muscles during breathing.</p><p>Open thoracostomy has been the traditional approach for surgical plication. Video-assisted thoracic (VAT) surgery may offer a less invasive method because it avoids the incision of the lower intercostal muscles, which may adversely affect ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, VAT is not universally available and further study comparing the two approaches is needed to determine if one approach is better than the other.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3970845081\"><span class=\"h4\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most appropriate timing for surgical correction is unknown. Surgical plication is seldom an emergency operation, and patients should be medically stabilized prior to operation. However, once the criteria for surgical plication are reached, there is evidence that suggest early intervention improves weight gain and growth and may prevent subsequent lung injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In our institution, patients with congenital eventration who require more than oxygen administration and cannot take adequate oral caloric intake will have their procedure performed within the first 7 to 10 days after birth. Patients who have traumatic or postoperative eventration will usually be supported until the pediatric surgeon is convinced that there will be no further improvement of diaphragmatic function (neural recovery). This usually will require the infant to have moderate to intensive medical support for three to four weeks before surgical plication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1490979626\"><span class=\"h4\">Outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The outcome of patients who undergo surgical plication is generally excellent.

Postoperative complications were reported in 13 patients (15 percent) and included pleural effusion and pneumonia. One month post-plication, symptoms were reported in only seven patients (tachypnea, vomiting, and recurrent respiratory infections).

In a subgroup of patients with more severe disease, surgical plication may be needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Respiratory supportive care is initiated to maintain target oxygen levels. In our center, target oxygen levels are between 90 to 95 percent for preterm infants and above 95 percent for term infants. Interventions range from supplemental oxygen via low-flow nasal cannula or hood to mechanical ventilation for infants with respiratory failure. (See <a href=\"#H26319735\" class=\"local\">'Medical management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The administration of adequate nutrition is dependent on the respiratory status of the infant. In patients with significant respiratory distress or requiring more invasive support (continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] or mechanical ventilation), nutrition is provided by gavage feedings or parenteral nutrition. (See <a href=\"#H26319735\" class=\"local\">'Medical management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest surgical plication be performed for patients with serious gastrointestinal abnormalities (eg, gastric volvulus) and those who continue to require moderate to intensive respiratory support (CPAP, high-flow, heated, humidified nasal cannula [HFHHNC], or mechanical ventilation) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In our institution, patients with congenital defects who require moderate to intensive level of care will have surgical plication performed within the first 7 to 10 days after birth. Patients with acquired eventration will undergo surgical repair if they need moderate to intensive support four weeks after the injury when no further neural recovery is expected. (See <a href=\"#H26319769\" class=\"local\">'Surgical plication'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eventration-of-the-diaphragm-in-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Wayne ER, Campbell JB, Burrington JD, Davis WS.
