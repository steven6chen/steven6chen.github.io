There are a few different types of sickle cell disease. A common type is called &quot;sickle cell anemia.&quot;</p><p>The red blood cells carry oxygen to organs in the body. Normal red blood cells are round. When people have sickle cell disease, some of their red blood cells can have an abnormal shape. They look like a crescent (or an old-time tool called a &quot;sickle&quot;). The abnormally shaped cells get stuck in the blood vessels easily, and so they don't bring enough oxygen to the body's organs. This can cause pain or organ damage.</p><p>Sickle cell disease is a life-long condition that people are born with. It is caused by an abnormal gene:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a person gets the sickle cell gene from both their mother and father, they will have a form of sickle cell disease called &quot;sickle cell anemia.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a person gets the sickle cell gene from 1 parent, and a different abnormal gene from the other parent, he or she will have one of the other forms of sickle cell disease. Examples of these different abnormal genes include several genes that affect hemoglobin. (Hemoglobin is a protein found inside red blood cells.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a person gets the abnormal gene from only 1 parent, and a normal gene from the other parent, this is called &quot;sickle cell trait.&quot; People with sickle cell trait generally do not have any of the symptoms of sickle cell disease. But they can pass the gene along to their children.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11333223\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of sickle cell disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms usually start after a baby is a few months old. Most commonly, people with sickle cell disease have episodes of pain. Some doctors use the term &quot;sickle cell crisis&quot; or &quot;sickle cell pain episode.&quot; The pain can be in the bones, chest, or other parts of the body. It can be mild or severe, and last hours to days. People can have other symptoms with their pain, too. The symptoms depend on how old they are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Babies can have pain in the hands and feet with swelling and redness.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older children and adults can have pain in the chest with trouble breathing, fever, or coughing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older children and adults can have pain in the bones.</p><p/><p>Most episodes of pain just happen because of the abnormal red blood cells, and can't be predicted. But sometimes, the pain can be related to other things, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection &ndash; People with sickle cell disease are more likely than others to get certain infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dehydration &ndash; Dehydration is when the body loses too much water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weather or air conditions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Travel to high-altitude places &ndash; These are places where there is less oxygen in the air, such as mountains. Flying in an airplane might also cause symptoms for people with sickle cell disease. Talk to your doctor about whether travel is safe for you, and what you can do to prevent problems.</p><p/><p>Sickle cell disease can also cause other symptoms and problems, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe anemia &ndash; Anemia is the medical term for having too few red blood cells. It makes people tired or weak. Most people with sickle cell disease have anemia. But in some cases, it can be severe and need treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very severe infections, which can be life threatening.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung problems &ndash; Symptoms can include trouble breathing or chest pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strokes &ndash; A stroke is when a part of the brain is damaged because of a problem with blood flow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open sores on the skin (usually on the legs)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A problem with the bone in the shoulder or hip &ndash; This happens when the bone doesn't get enough blood, leading to pain in the bone or joint. In some cases this can cause permanent damage. Doctors call this problem &quot;osteonecrosis&quot; or &quot;avascular necrosis.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In men, an erection that lasts too long and is very painful</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11333238\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for sickle cell disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. A blood test can show if someone has sickle cell disease. All newborn babies in the United States are tested for sickle cell disease before they leave the hospital.</p><p>Some parents are tested for the sickle cell gene before getting pregnant. This is to find out their risk of having a baby with sickle cell disease. Talk to your doctor about whether you should be tested.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11333253\"><span class=\"h1\">How is sickle cell disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sickle cell disease involves life-long treatment. Some treatments help prevent the different problems sickle cell disease can cause. Others are aimed at relieving pain or treating other problems, like infection. Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics &ndash; Daily antibiotics help prevent infections in young children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaccines &ndash; Getting all vaccines helps prevent infections. This is especially important in children and also true for adults.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Hydroxyurea</a> (sample brand names: Droxia, Hydrea) &ndash; This medicine helps the body make more normal red blood cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood transfusions &ndash; A blood transfusion is when a person gets blood that was given by another person. People who have a high chance of having a stroke might get blood transfusions to help prevent strokes. People might also get blood transfusions to treat anemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Folic acid</a> &ndash; A vitamin called folic acid (also called folate) is needed for people with sickle cell disease to make red blood cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain medicines &ndash; Doctors can use different medicines to treat pain. Your doctor can help you make a plan for treating pain at home. If the pain is severe, people might need treatment in the hospital or regular pain medicines every day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to treat infection (antibiotics) &ndash; It is important for people with sickle cell disease to be treated for infections right away. It is very important to call your doctor if you think you might have an infection.</p><p/><p>A procedure called a &quot;bone marrow transplant&quot; or &quot;stem cell transplant&quot; can cure sickle cell disease. This procedure replaces the cells that make your blood with healthy cells. But this treatment is not done very often for sickle cell disease. That's because it has many side effects and can be done only if people meet certain conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11333268\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will tell you what to look for and when to call for help. In general, you should call right away if the person with sickle cell disease has any of the following problems. Do not wait to call, even if it's the middle of the night, because it's important to get treatment right away. Call for help if the person:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gets a fever or has other signs of infection (for example, feeling very tired, loss of appetite, stiff neck, headache, trouble breathing, or cough).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has pain that doesn't get better after it is treated at home</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has an erection that lasts longer than 2 to 4 hours</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has trouble breathing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has symptoms of a stroke. Symptoms might include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Seizure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Not being able to wake up</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trouble speaking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Drooping of the face on one side</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Weakness in an arm or leg</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some of these stroke symptoms are shown in the picture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73487\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73487 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11333283\"><span class=\"h1\">What else can people with sickle cell disease do to stay healthy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with sickle cell disease should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>See their doctor for regular check-ups, and follow his or her instructions about treatments and tests.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get the vaccines that the doctor or nurse recommends. Vaccines can prevent certain serious or deadly infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take good care of themselves, including staying well hydrated, exercising, eating a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11333298\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I have sickle cell disease and want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have sickle cell disease and want to get pregnant, talk with your doctor or nurse. He or she might recommend that you see a &quot;genetic counselor.&quot; This person can tell you your baby's chance of having sickle cell disease or sickle cell trait.</p><p>If you have sickle cell disease and are pregnant, your doctor will follow you and your baby closely throughout your pregnancy. That's because sickle cell disease can cause problems for both you and your baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11333313\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-your-child-has-sickle-cell-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When your child has sickle cell disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-cell-trait-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sickle cell trait (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-babies-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for babies and children age 0 to 6 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-marrow-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone marrow transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=priapism-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Priapism (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-infants-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Adult vaccines (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Stroke symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-bone-marrow-transplantation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (bone marrow transplantation) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
