The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies patients with PH into five groups, as shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-definition-classification-risk-factors-screening-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. SSc is most often associated with group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and group 3 PH, and less commonly with group 2 PH. Due to the varied and sometimes mixed etiology underlying PH in SSc, the precise classification of the type of PH can be challenging.</p><p>The following is a brief description of the WHO classification of PH:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group 1 consists of patients that have pulmonary <strong>arterial</strong> hypertension (PAH). Most patients in this category have idiopathic PAH. However, others include inheritable, drug-related, and connective tissue disease-associated PAH.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group 2 consists of patients who have pulmonary <strong>venous</strong> hypertension, which is usually due to left heart disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group 3 consists of patients who have PH due to chronic lung disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic hypoxemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group 4 consists of patients with chronic thromboembolic disease causing PH.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group 5 consists of patients who have PH that is of uncertain cause and likely multifactorial.</p><p/><p>When all five groups are described collectively, the term PH is used. When referring to patients in group 1, the term PAH is used (the focus of this topic). A more detailed description of the classification of PH is discussed separately.

PAH is the leading cause of death in SSc, with two-year survival rates ranging from 64 to 89 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-definition-classification-risk-factors-screening-and-prognosis/abstract/12,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,15</a>]. In addition, a significant proportion of patients with SSc-PAH (approximately 22 percent) are asymptomatic at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-definition-classification-risk-factors-screening-and-prognosis/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. This high prevalence rate, poor survival, and lack of symptoms, combined with the observation that early treatment of milder disease improves symptoms and may prolong survival, provides a rationale for screening for PAH in patients with SSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-definition-classification-risk-factors-screening-and-prognosis/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].

SSc patients who are at greatest risk for PAH are those with long-standing limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc), a low (&lt;70 percent predicted) or progressive decline in the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a high forced vital <span class=\"nowrap\">capacity/DLCO</span> ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">(FVC/DLCO</span> &gt;1.6). Additional risk factors include anticentromere, anti-U1-ribonuleoprotein, and nucleolar pattern antinuclear antibodies. Exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with SSc has also been associated with the development of PAH during the course of their disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F93544\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93544 \">table 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H174327834\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63163110\"><span class=\"h3\">Long-standing SSc</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-standing SSc has been associated with the development of PAH in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-definition-classification-risk-factors-screening-and-prognosis/abstract/11,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,22-24</a>]. One meta-analysis reported longer SSc disease duration correlated positively with the development of PAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-definition-classification-risk-factors-screening-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Age has also been identified as a risk factor for the development in PAH in SSc. It is thought that this may be due to an association between age and long-standing disease. A prospective observational study of 709 SSc patients reported a 22 percent increase in the risk of PAH for every 10 years after disease onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-definition-classification-risk-factors-screening-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In the same study, patients &gt;60 years had a twofold greater risk of PAH compared with those &lt;60 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63163104\"><span class=\"h3\">Limited cutaneous SSc</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc) has historically been associated with an increased risk for the development of PAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-definition-classification-risk-factors-screening-and-prognosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Most series of PAH in scleroderma have significantly more patients with lcSSc. However, subsequent studies have more carefully evaluated patients with the diffuse form of cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) and PAH is more frequent in this population than initially thought [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-definition-classification-risk-factors-screening-and-prognosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. For example one 2008 study reported that the prevalence of PAH was similar in both SSc subsets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-definition-classification-risk-factors-screening-and-prognosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Since dcSSc patients are more likely to have pulmonary or cardiac fibrosis, distinguishing PAH from other types of PH in these patients is challenging. &#160;</p><p>Patients with lcSSc have skin manifestation limited to the hands and frequently have prominent vascular manifestations (eg, Raynaud phenomenon and telangiectasia). The total burden of cutaneous telangiectasias, common in lcSSc, also correlates positively with the risk of PAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-definition-classification-risk-factors-screening-and-prognosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

This was best demonstrated by a case control study of 106 patients with lcSSc with PAH who were matched to patients without PAH according to age, gender, extent of skin involvement, and disease duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-definition-classification-risk-factors-screening-and-prognosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Compared with controls, patients with systemic sclerosis-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (SSc&ndash;PAH), had a lower DLCO (52 versus 81 percent of predicted) that preceded the development of PAH by, on average, five years. In addition, the DLCO declined linearly in patients with PAH over a 10- to 15-year period but remained unchanged in the control group. Other observational studies of patients with SSc have reported a low <span class=\"nowrap\">DLCO/alveolar</span> volume ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">(DLCO/V<sub>A</sub></span> &lt;70 percent) or a DLCO that is decreased disproportionately to the forced vital capacity (ie, FVC <span class=\"nowrap\">percent/DLCO</span> percent &gt;1.6) as predictors for the development of SSc-PAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-definition-classification-risk-factors-screening-and-prognosis/abstract/3,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,30</a>].

The most commonly used assessment tools are clinical evaluation, pulmonary function testing (PFTs), and echocardiography. The initial screening for both PAH and interstitial lung disease (ILD) in patients newly diagnosed with SSc is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-complications-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary complications of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)&quot;, section on 'Evaluation for lung disease at time of SSc presentation'</a>.)</p><p>Most experts agree that screening should be considered at the initial visit with re-evaluation at intervals throughout the disease course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-definition-classification-risk-factors-screening-and-prognosis/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. In addition, most clinicians agree that routine screening with echocardiogram <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> right heart catheterization (RHC) is not practical. Consequently, screening algorithms that combine clinical, physiologic, and echocardiographic findings in high-risk SSc patients have been used to identify those in whom RHC is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-definition-classification-risk-factors-screening-and-prognosis/abstract/42,43,47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43,47-49</a>]. Specific algorithm parameters vary among studies and further validation is needed before for they can be routinely used. The potential pitfalls of screening with echocardiography include the impact of false positive and false negative results. False positive results may lead to unnecessary RHC and related complications, as well as unnecessary patient anxiety. False negative results may lead to false reassurance and decreased vigilance in the clinical assessment of symptoms and signs of PAH, potentially delaying diagnosis and initiation of therapy. False positives are particularly common among patients with SSc who also have ILD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-definition-classification-risk-factors-screening-and-prognosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Our practice is the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with SSc are screened for the signs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms of PAH (eg, dyspnea, syncope, signs of right heart failure, loud pulmonic [P2] heart sound) at initial presentation and every visit during follow-up.

We decrease the frequency of PFTS to every two years in patients with long-standing SSc (more than five years) if they have a normal DLCO, no dyspnea or exercise intolerance, and in those with PFTs that have remained unchanged over several years (more than three years). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography on the initial visit in patients with SSc who have symptoms (eg, dyspnea on exertion) or are at substantially increased risk for PAH (eg, long-standing disease, limited cutaneous SSc [lcSSc], low DLCO) or when other SSc-associated complications are suspected (eg, constrictive cardiomyopathy, pericardial effusion). We do not advocate routine echocardiographic PAH screening for patients with SSc who have no suggestive symptoms and have a normal DLCO. When the DLCO is decreased, we assess for concomitant restrictive disease or abnormal high resolution computed tomography findings that might suggest interstitial lung disease as an alternate explanation for the reduced DLCO. If systemic sclerosis-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (SSc&ndash;PAH) is suspected based on the clinical features, pulmonary function tests, and echocardiogram, then a RHC is performed.
