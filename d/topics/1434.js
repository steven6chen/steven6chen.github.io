The term used in the medical literature for this observation is patient-ventilator asynchrony or dyssynchrony. Clinical signs include anxiety, agitation, tachypnea, tachycardia, use of accessory muscles of breathing, uncoordinated thoracic wall or abdominal movement, and asynchrony with the ventilator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Because respiratory distress may signify the onset of a life-threatening complication, a rapid, focused evaluation is required (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52670\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52670 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Respiratory distress that occurs soon after the initiation (or reestablishment) of mechanical ventilation is often the result of inadequate ventilator support or insufficient sedation. Errors in setting the ventilator are common, and also should be considered if respiratory distress occurs during procedures or patient transport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Respiratory distress can often be managed by observing the patient's breathing pattern, and changing the ventilator settings to match respiratory rate, triggering efforts, and requirements for peak inspiratory flow (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>). Prospective data suggest that adjusting the ventilator is more effective than sedation at reducing breath-stacking, a common and potentially hazardous form of dyssynchrony, than increasing sedation and analgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Detecting and effectively treating dyssynchrony to improve patient-ventilator interaction is an important skill for clinicians who care for ventilated patients, since dyssynchrony is associated with respiratory muscle fatigue and a longer duration of mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis and evaluation of respiratory distress in a previously stable patient receiving mechanical ventilation will be reviewed here. The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-epidemiology-pathophysiology-pathology-and-etiology-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, pathology, and etiology in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation of adults in acute respiratory distress syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory distress in mechanically ventilated patients can be classified anatomically as originating in the airway, the pulmonary parenchyma, or outside the lungs. Common causes include endotracheal tube obstruction, heart failure, pneumonia, patient-ventilator asynchrony due to inadequate sedation, and compression of the lungs by pleural fluid or ascites (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65177\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65177 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The artificial airway is composed of the endotracheal tube (ETT) and, in many cases, a heat and moisture exchanger (HME). The artificial airway is an important cause of respiratory distress. As an example, the HME may become saturated with secretions, leading to increased airway resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Endotracheal tube</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Problems related to the endotracheal tube include obstruction by secretions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F98321\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98321 \">picture 1</a>), blood, torsion, kinking, or a foreign body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F93200\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93200 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, the patient can bite on, or completely through, the ETT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F98323\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98323 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Excessive neck movement can cause significant displacement, with neck extension leading to superior migration of the ETT and neck flexion leading to inferior migration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55694%7EPULM%2F68470\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55694 graphicRef68470 \">figure 2A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Specific, dedicated endotracheal tube holders have become common in many intensive care settings, and preliminary evidence suggests that endotracheal tube displacement is less likely with these devices than with adhesive or non-adhesive tape in cadaveric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] or manikin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] models. Whether these findings are applicable in patients is unknown.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superior migration of the ETT to a position above the vocal cords results in incomplete delivery of the set tidal volume or pressure and the escape of air from the nose and mouth during the ventilator-delivered breath.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inferior migration of the ETT may result in unilateral intubation of a mainstem bronchus, putting the patient at risk for barotrauma and pneumothorax as the entire set tidal volume or pressure is delivered to one lung. When this occurs, the right mainstem bronchus is more frequently intubated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis, management, and prevention of pulmonary barotrauma during invasive mechanical ventilation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The balloon cuff at the end of the ETT may leak or rupture, leading to incomplete delivery of the set tidal volume or pressure and loss of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). This usually results in an audible air leak and a deflated pilot balloon. Similarly, patients can bite through the pilot balloon tube, causing cuff deflation. Herniation of the ETT cuff over the end of the tube has been reported as a cause of respiratory distress and increased airway pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Large and medium-sized airways</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory distress can also be caused by abnormalities in the large and medium sized airways of the tracheobronchial tree.</p><p>Abundant thick airway secretions may become impacted in the lower airways, causing obstruction and atelectasis. The character and volume of secretions prior to the onset of the respiratory distress can help establish this diagnosis. Excessive airway secretions can sometimes be detected by examining the flow-volume loop on the ventilator display, where a sawtooth pattern may represent intermittent changes in airway resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Ensuring adequate humidification of the inspired gases may diminish inspissation of secretions. Frequent airway suctioning, pulmonary toilet, and bronchoscopy have also been used to facilitate clearance of secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In some cases, unrecognized foreign body aspiration at the time of intubation can result in acute respiratory decompensation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-foreign-bodies-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway foreign bodies in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to underlying lung disease and mechanical obstruction, bronchospasm may cause acute respiratory distress, most commonly in patients with COPD, asthma, or volume overload. Bronchoscopy, airway suctioning, the use of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, and allergic reactions can also contribute to bronchospasm and respiratory distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Conventional treatment with inhaled bronchodilators is usually sufficient; in severe cases of upper airway edema caused by the endotracheal tube, corticosteroids may be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-the-endotracheal-tube-following-initial-placement-prevention-and-management-in-adult-intensive-care-unit-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of the endotracheal tube following initial placement: Prevention and management in adult intensive care unit patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bronchospasm may also be complicated by dynamic hyperinflation (also called auto-PEEP), which will exacerbate patient distress by increasing work of breathing. In addition, auto-PEEP may cause hypotension and, in severe cases, may present as a cardiopulmonary arrest with pulseless electrical activity. Auto-PEEP usually occurs in the setting of obstructive lung disease, but it may also occur in patients with markedly increased minute ventilatory requirements, for example, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Auto-PEEP may be precipitated by an increase in either airway resistance or minute ventilation or by a reduction in the peak inspiratory flow setting.</p><p>Auto-PEEP may be appreciated on physical examination and confirmed by review of the flow-time waveforms. Auto-PEEP can be quantified by execution of an expiratory hold maneuver during mechanical ventilation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52820\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52820 \">figure 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-and-pathophysiologic-consequences-of-mechanical-ventilation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic and pathophysiologic consequences of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Auto-PEEP'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary parenchyma and vasculature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atelectasis, pneumonia, aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastroesophageal contents, pulmonary edema, and pulmonary emboli can all cause respiratory distress in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.</p><p>With the exception of acute pulmonary embolism, these conditions can usually be differentiated by physical examination and plain chest radiography. Acute pulmonary embolism is notoriously difficult to diagnose, since there are no specific symptoms, signs, or chest radiograph findings, but it is even more difficult in the mechanically ventilated patient for several reasons. Ventilation scans are difficult to perform in mechanically ventilated patients. In addition, interpretation of perfusion scans in the presence of preexisting pulmonary disease, and without the benefit of a ventilation scan, is difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. CT scans and angiograms are diagnostic but require patient transport, which may be difficult in severely ill patients. Although echocardiography can be done emergently at the bedside with a high degree of diagnostic sensitivity in hemodynamically compromised patients, it is not specific. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Problems outside the lung</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extrapulmonary processes can cause respiratory distress by restricting inspiration or increasing respiratory drive. Thoracic processes that cause restriction include pneumothorax and large pleural effusions. Abdominal problems, such as ascites, ileus, or splinting from abdominal pain, may limit chest wall expansion and lower the compliance of the respiratory system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal compartment syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fever, shock, pain, delirium, and anxiety can increase respiratory drive and cause apparent respiratory distress and agitation without a change in respiratory mechanics or gas exchange. These are diagnoses of exclusion, however, and life-threatening disorders must always be considered before administering sedatives, analgesics, or neuroleptics. The source of the patient's pain or discomfort should be sought and specifically treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Primary measures to prevent and treat delirium (such as minimizing sleep deprivation, reassurance, and providing orientation to time, place, and situation) may be effective. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute toxic-metabolic encephalopathy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pain-control-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pain control in the critically ill adult patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Selection, initiation, maintenance, and withdrawal&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in the evaluation is to perform a rapid assessment of the patient and the monitoring equipment, to determine the urgency of the situation, and to identify obvious problems, while acquiring relevant information from the bedside nurse and respiratory therapist. This quick survey should evaluate the appearance of the patient, the vital signs (including pulse oximetry), cardiac rate and rhythm, the patency of the ventilator circuit connections, and the position and condition of the artificial airway, including a check for air leaking from the nose or mouth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52670\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52670 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Following this brief assessment, if the cause of patient distress is not determined, a chest radiograph, arterial blood gas, and electrocardiogram should be obtained. A chest radiograph is central to the evaluation of respiratory distress in ventilated patients. Important findings include the position of the endotracheal tube (ETT) as well as signs of pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or atelectasis. Further diagnostic evaluation may be based on the findings of the plain chest film.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial stabilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If respiratory distress is severe, or the patient is hemodynamically unstable, stabilization is essential and must take precedence over a detailed evaluation or diagnostic procedures. The patient should be disconnected from the ventilator and manual ventilations with 100 percent oxygen should be administered. This maneuver allows the clinician to focus on the patient and &quot;feel&quot; the mechanics of the respiratory system, while supporting oxygenation and ventilation. If the patient's status improves immediately after the institution of manual ventilations, the ventilator or the ventilator settings are the source of the problem (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52670\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52670 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the patient's condition rapidly deteriorates despite manual ventilation, empiric treatment of immediately life-threatening conditions may be required before a definitive diagnosis is made. As an example, respiratory distress accompanied by hypotension and unilaterally decreased breath sounds may require presumptive treatment of a tension pneumothorax with needle decompression followed by placement of a thoracostomy tube. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of thoracostomy tubes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If manual ventilations meet with minimal resistance, the clinician must verify that air is not escaping from the patient's nose or mouth. Air leaking from the nose and mouth suggests that the ETT has migrated superiorly (above the vocal cords) or that the cuff has ruptured or deflated. Inspection of the ETT position with respect to the incisors, and examination of the pressure within the pilot balloon are essential (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55694\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55694 \">figure 2A</a>). In general, either problem requires replacement of the ETT. If an air leak is not audible, the expiratory tidal volume should be compared to the set tidal volume during mechanical ventilation; an expiratory tidal volume smaller than the set tidal volume suggests the presence of a leak in the system. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-the-endotracheal-tube-following-initial-placement-prevention-and-management-in-adult-intensive-care-unit-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of the endotracheal tube following initial placement: Prevention and management in adult intensive care unit patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If manual ventilations are difficult and do not improve the patient's condition, the patency of the ETT should be assessed using a suction catheter. Failure of the catheter to pass easily confirms obstruction of the ETT. Reversible causes of ETT obstruction should be treated empirically by repositioning the patient's head (to alleviate kinking) or inserting a bite block. If these maneuvers fail, the ETT can be replaced using a flexible exchange catheter. In select cases, the ETT can be removed, and the need for continued mechanical ventilation assessed. If the patient is unlikely to tolerate extubation, and there is no improvement after ETT replacement, urgent bronchoscopy to assess airway patency should be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Indications and contraindications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the suction catheter passes easily, a trial of increased sedation, with or without short-term neuromuscular paralysis, may help determine whether respiratory distress is the result of an intrinsic respiratory problem, or the consequence of an increase in the patient's respiratory efforts. If the distress resolves with sedation, active respiratory effort is the likely cause and the underlying etiology must be sought. Possibilities include hypercapnia or hypoxemia, delirium, pain, fever, shock, or a structural CNS lesion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Selection, initiation, maintenance, and withdrawal&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-neuromuscular-blocking-agents-in-critically-ill-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of neuromuscular blocking agents in critically ill patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Persistent difficulty with manual ventilations despite sedation or paralysis suggests the presence of a new lower airway, parenchymal, or thoracic wall problem.

A brief discussion among those caring for the patient, including the clinician, nurse, and respiratory therapist, often reveals important clues to the cause of a patient's distress. Examples include recent chest pain, a change in the quality or quantity of respiratory secretions, administration of new medications, or changes in ventilator parameters.</p><p>The physical examination frequently localizes the cause of respiratory distress. Trends in the vital signs and all available hemodynamic data should be reviewed. Tachypnea is almost universal in this setting. Hypotension in combination with an increase in central venous pressure may accompany excessive auto-PEEP, tension pneumothorax, or massive pulmonary embolism. Fever may complicate infection, pulmonary embolism, or allergic reaction. Hypertension and tachycardia are common during an episode of respiratory distress; in the absence of other findings, they may signify pain or anxiety.</p><p>The cardiopulmonary examination should focus on evidence of bronchospasm, equality of breath sounds, and signs of volume overload. Bronchospasm usually presents with wheezing or rhonchi. Unequal breath sounds suggest unilateral mainstem bronchus intubation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. Crackles, wheezing, or rhonchi may reflect pulmonary edema. The presence of any nonpulmonary abnormalities, including abdominal distension and signs of deep venous thrombosis, should be noted.</p><p>Most intubated patients are continuously monitored with pulse oximetry, which can detect decreases in the oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>). However, there are important technical limitations to pulse oximetry. Significant drops in the arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) may not result in a corresponding change in the SaO<sub>2</sub>, especially when they occur at high oxygen tensions (&gt;100 mmHg). Other conditions associated with inaccurate pulse oximetry include poor peripheral perfusion, excessive patient movement, abnormal hemoglobin, very low SaO<sub>2</sub>, and certain dyes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulse-oximetry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulse oximetry&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Arterial blood gases should be measured if the cause of respiratory distress is not immediately apparent, if pulse oximetry demonstrates desaturation, or if the pulse oximetry waveform is unreliable. The presence of hypoxemia or hypercapnia on blood gas analysis suggests diagnostic possibilities and indicates specific therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Recognizing trends and acute changes in respiratory mechanics can aid in the diagnosis of respiratory distress. The peak inspiratory pressure (Ppeak), the plateau pressure (Pplat), and the difference between the two (delta Ppeak &ndash; Pplat) provide important information about the resistance and compliance of the respiratory system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. These pressures should be measured only during volume-controlled ventilation with a constant flow (ie, square wave) pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Accurate assessment may require additional sedation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71863\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71863 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>The Ppeak is the highest pressure measured during the respiratory cycle, and is a function of both the resistance of the airways and the compliance of the respiratory system. Pplat is the pressure recorded during a pause at end-inspiration; because the Pplat is measured while there is no airflow, it reflects the static compliance of the respiratory system, including the lung parenchyma, chest wall, and abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>An increase in the Ppeak with a widening of the delta Ppeak &ndash; Pplat suggests that an increase in airway resistance is the cause of respiratory distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Obstruction of the ETT (eg, by inspissated secretions, a kinked tube, or the patient biting the tube) and bronchospasm can cause this change in respiratory mechanics.</p><p>In contrast, an increase in both the Ppeak and Pplat with a delta Ppeak &ndash; Pplat that narrows or stays the same suggests a decrease in respiratory system compliance.

Alternatively, it is often referred to as &quot;bucking&quot; or &quot;fighting&quot; the ventilator. Signs include agitation, tachypnea, tachycardia, use of accessory muscles of breathing, uncoordinated thoracic wall or abdominal movement, asynchrony with the ventilator, and deterioration in gas exchange. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mechanical ventilator, endotracheal tube, airways, and lung parenchyma are all potential sources of respiratory distress, as are extrapulmonary processes. Frequent causes include endotracheal tube obstruction, mucus plugging, heart failure, pneumonia, aspiration, pulmonary embolism, and extra-pulmonary etiologies such as pleural effusion and ascites. In addition, it may reflect an increase in the respiratory drive without any change in respiratory mechanics, such as due to pain, fear, anxiety, delirium, or a new intracerebral process. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe respiratory distress or hemodynamic instability should be disconnected from the ventilator and manually ventilated with 100 percent oxygen. This allows the clinician to feel the mechanics of the respiratory system, while supporting oxygenation and ventilation. The resistance and response to manual ventilation provide important information regarding the etiology of the respiratory distress. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Initial stabilization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the clinical condition is stable, a definitive diagnostic evaluation can be initiated. This includes a focused history, physical exam, arterial blood gas analysis, and chest radiograph, as well as assessment of lung mechanics using measurements from the ventilator. The likely cause of the respiratory distress is usually identified by this evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Focused assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory mechanics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An algorithm for the evaluation and management of acute respiratory distress in mechanically ventilated patients is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52670\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52670 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-respiratory-distress-in-the-mechanically-ventilated-patient/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Glauser FL, Polatty RC, Sessler CN.
