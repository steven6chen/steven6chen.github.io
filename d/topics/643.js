People sometimes refer to alternative medicine as &quot;complementary medicine.&quot; Other related terms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Holistic care&quot; &ndash; This means considering the whole person, including their spiritual and emotional state, when treating a health problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Integrative medicine&quot; &ndash; This means including alternative treatments as part of mainstream medical practice, based on evidence.</p><p/><p>Examples of alternative medicine include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acupuncture</strong> &ndash; People having acupuncture have thin needles inserted into their skin in different places. The needles do not hurt, or they hurt very little.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Herbal remedies</strong> &ndash; Herbal remedies are usually pills or liquids that contain substances found in plants. Even though herbal remedies are &quot;natural,&quot; they are not always safe. Plants sometimes have chemicals that can hurt the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Homeopathy</strong> &ndash; People who use homeopathy take small amounts of substances that would make them sick if they took them in large amounts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mind-body techniques</strong> &ndash; Examples of mind-body techniques include hypnosis and guided imagery. These techniques are supposed to calm you and help you change the way you think about your symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Massage therapy</strong> &ndash; During massage therapy the person giving the massage rubs, kneads, and presses on the other person's body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reiki and other &quot;energy therapies&quot;</strong> &ndash; People who believe in energy therapies such as Reiki think that energy flows throughout the body. During Reiki treatment, the person giving the treatment &quot;directs&quot; energy toward the person having treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Special diets</strong> &ndash; People with cancer and other health problems sometimes hear that their condition could improve if they ate a special diet. These diets might contain no meat, or require people to take special supplements.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39184963\"><span class=\"h1\">Is it safe to try alternative medicine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many forms of alternative and holistic care are safe. And some can be helpful. But it's important to be cautious, especially if you are trying supplements or herbal treatments. In some countries, including the United States, these products are not regulated by the government the way standard medicines are. In some cases they contain ingredients that can cause harm. They can also be expensive. Be careful about any non-prescription product that claims to be a &quot;miracle pill,&quot; or says it cures cancer or another serious disease.</p><p>If you use or are thinking about using alternative medicine, be sure to talk with your doctor or nurse. He or she can tell you if there are any risks involved with the alternative medicine you have in mind.</p><p>It is important to talk with your doctor or nurse, because:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some herbal medicines, such as the herbal antidepressant Saint John's Wort, can interact with prescription medicines and keep them from working.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some herbal medicines are toxic and dangerous. For example, kava kava (which people take for anxiety) can damage the liver and might not be safe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some special diets cause people to lose weight very quickly. And that can cause health problems. Plus, special diets can be very expensive even though they might not help people get better.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2960897102\"><span class=\"h1\">Where can I find reliable information about herbs and supplements?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It can be hard to know where to look for accurate information about herbal remedies or dietary supplements.
