IgE levels are sometimes useful. Serum immunoglobulin D (IgD) is not used in the diagnosis of immunodeficiency.</p><p>There are several methods for determining serum immunoglobulin levels, and laboratories use different systems. Therefore, it is critical that age-adjusted normal reference ranges are provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F110584\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110584 \">table 1</a>). Hypogammaglobulinemia is defined as an IgG less than two standard deviations from normal, and agammaglobulinemia is usually considered when IgG is &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. Panhypogammaglobulinemia (ie, low levels of IgA, IgG, and IgM) is a hallmark of most forms of severe combined immunodeficiency. In other combined immunodeficiencies, as well as in several predominantly humoral immunodeficiencies, there are characteristic alterations in the profile of immunoglobulin isotypes that may aid in diagnosis (eg, selective IgA deficiency, selective IgM deficiency, and hyperimmunoglobulin M immunodeficiencies).</p><p>In addition to IgG, IgA, and IgM, measurement of IgG subclasses and IgE may be useful:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of IgG subclasses may be valuable in children older than one year of age and in adults, particularly if the IgG level is borderline low <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> there is a weak or absent antibody response to vaccination.

Antibody function cannot be measured if a patient has received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> in the past months. Antibody function is critical for determining the integrity of humoral immunity for two reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinically significant impairment in antibody function can be present even when serum antibody levels are normal.

This pattern is typically seen with secondary causes of hypogammaglobulinemia, such as that caused by medications, protein loss, or severe malnutrition.

Routine vaccinations provide examples of both types:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of antibody titers to tetanus, diphtheria, <em>H. influenzae</em> B, and protein-conjugated pneumococcal vaccines (eg, Prevnar) are used to assess response to protein antigens. Antibody titers to other vaccines (eg, hepatitis A and hepatitis B, measles, others) can also be used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of antibody titers to multiple serotypes in pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (Pneumovax 23, Pnu-imune 23) are used to assess response to polysaccharide antigens. This evaluation is useful in adults and children older than two years. This response is particularly important in making a diagnosis of selective antibody deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-antibody-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific antibody deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isohemagglutinins are antibodies generated in response to polysaccharides of gut flora and which cross-react with A or B blood group erythrocyte antigens. They generally appear in the blood by six months of age in individuals who have blood types <strong>other than</strong> AB. Antibodies to streptococcal antigens (eg, Streptolysin O and Anti-DNAase) are normally present in all subjects after two years of age; very low titers also suggest antibody deficiency. However, vaccine responsiveness is generally considered to be a more reliable indicator of intact humoral immune function. Isohemagglutinin testing is reviewed in more detail separately.

However, because antibody production by B cells requires intact T cell function, most T cell defects lead to combined (cellular and humoral) immunodeficiency.</p><p>An evaluation of cellular immunity is appropriate for patients with severe viral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bacterial illnesses or opportunistic infections. The disorders that can impair cellular immunity are different in various age groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children younger than one year of age, primary immunodeficiencies are the most common cause of impaired cellular immunity, although perinatal cytomegalovirus (CMV) and other herpes virus infections can cause transient or persistent cellular immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In older children and adults, the major causes are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and iatrogenic immune suppression due to therapy for autoimmune disease, malignancy, or transplantation. Occasionally, mild forms of primary combined immunodeficiency or DiGeorge syndrome escape diagnosis until adolescence or adulthood.</p><p/><p>The most profound combined immunodeficiencies are classified under the heading &quot;severe combined immunodeficiency&quot; or SCID. SCID disorders usually present in infancy, while less severe combined immunodeficiencies present in children and occasionally in adolescents or adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=combined-immunodeficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Combined immunodeficiencies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Complete blood count with differential and blood smear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The complete blood count (CBC) with differential and blood smear provides valuable information about the cellular immune system. Normal lymphocyte counts in infants are much higher than in older children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In many primary immunodeficiency disorders, cell populations are initially normal and then decline over time. Thus, normal results in the past cannot be relied upon as a reflection of the current state.</p><p>In patients suspected of having a defect in cellular immunity, the CBC establishes the presence or absence of lymphopenia and any associated gross hematologic abnormalities, some of which may greatly assist in diagnosis. For example, patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome have low numbers of small platelets. A single finding of lymphopenia should be interpreted with caution, since transient lymphopenia is frequently found in a variety of common infectious illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, significant lymphopenia that does not rapidly correct should not be ignored, since lymphopenia may be the first indication of cellular immunodeficiency or another serious disease (eg, lymphoma) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F58469\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58469 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In rare situations, a normal lymphocyte count can be seen in the presence of a severe immunodeficiency. If the clinical presentation is highly suggestive of an underlying disorder (eg, a patient with <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia and invasive candida), then lymphocyte subsets should be evaluated with flow cytometry, even if the total lymphocyte count is normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H674032\"><span class=\"h4\">Evaluation of lymphopenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphopenia can be caused by an array of disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F58469\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58469 \">table 2</a>).

In the absence of other indicators of immune dysfunction, there should (at the very least) be subsequent measurement of the lymphocyte count to document normalization.

This test measures the recall response to an intradermal injection of an antigen to which an individual has already been exposed over a period of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. For that reason, skin testing is usually not of much value under the age of one year.</p><p>A positive response to intracutaneous antigen injection requires uptake and processing of antigen by antigen-presenting cells, their interaction with CD4+ helper T cells, cytokine production by T cells, and subsequent recruitment and activation of monocytes and macrophages. Thus, skin testing is a sensitive indicator of intact cellular immunity, but negative results must be interpreted with caution, because an impairment in any step of the response pathway will lead to a negative response. In addition, the DTH response is unreliable in children under one year of age (even with prior antigen exposure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and is often suppressed during viral and bacterial infection (even with live-attenuated vaccines as in the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine). DTH skin reactivity is also suppressed by anti-inflammatory drugs (glucocorticoids) and other immunosuppressants (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, mycophenolic acid).

A control tube with cells and media alone is also incubated. During the last 24 hours of culture, tritiated thymidine is added to the cultures. Dividing lymphocytes incorporate the thymidine into their DNA. The extent of proliferation is determined by measuring the radioactivity taken up by cells. The test is interpreted as negative, partial, or normal by comparing patient results with normal control lymphocytes assayed simultaneously and with the normal ranges for controls in the laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Many laboratories also report results as a stimulation index (SI).

Thus, these tests should be performed when the patient is relatively well and not receiving glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive medications, whenever possible.

Mitogens are powerful stimulants for T cells, and responses may be assessed in patients of any age, even newborns, regardless of immunization status.</p><p>Normal reference ranges are derived from studies on the cells of healthy adults. Newborns generally have higher mitogen responses compared with adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Depending upon the mitogens and the laboratory, the range of CPM reported for normal controls is approximately 50,000 to 300,000, and SI is between 10 and 200. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) is most commonly used. Results for patients in comparison with controls are roughly interpreted as normal (&gt;50 percent of control), low (25 to 50 percent), very low (10 to 25 percent), or absent (&lt;10 percent). Results expressed as SI vary widely between laboratories. In general, a SI &lt;10 may be considered as no response.</p><p>Some researchers have also used in vitro stimulation with the OKT3 monoclonal antibody as a measure of T cell function. OKT3 binds to the epsilon chain of the T cell CD3 complex and stimulates T cells (in the presence of accessory or antigen-presenting cells) in a manner analogous to T cell mitogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Cell response to mitogen or OKT3 is generally similar, although they may sometimes give different patterns in the context of distinct immune defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. There are no published comparisons in a large group of normal individuals or immune-deficient patients. Most clinical reference laboratories use one or more mitogens and one or more antigens, but do not routinely use OKT3.</p><p>Diminished or absent proliferation signals a serious derangement of T cell function. Mitogen responses will be severely depressed (usually well below the control fifth percentile) in the vast majority of patients with profound lymphopenia (eg, complete DiGeorge syndrome), SCID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], or advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). By comparison, the response may be partial or normal in milder syndromes of combined deficiency (eg, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome), in mainly humoral deficiency, or in those with infections (especially CMV and other herpes viruses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h4\">Response to specific antigens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific antigen tests are more sensitive than mitogen assays as indicators of defects in T cell function, since the mechanisms of activation are more complex than those for mitogens. These tests require antigen processing and presentation by antigen-presenting cells, although T cell recruitment of effector cells (eg, in vivo DTH) is not necessary. As with DTH, in vitro-specific antigen proliferation tests are not useful in infants or other patients who have not completed a primary series of immunizations.</p><p>Tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and monilia (<em>Candida</em>) are antigens frequently used for this assay. Since only a small number of cells respond, the cultures must be maintained longer, and incorporation of radioactivity is lower than for mitogen stimulation. Results expressed as CPM are often reported from 5000 to 50,000; results as SI generally range from 4 to 50. In general, a SI for specific antigen &gt;4 is usually considered adequate, although an isolated SI &lt;4 is not a reliable indicator of impaired cellular immunity.</p><p>In many cases of combined immunodeficiency, responses to specific antigens are diminished or even absent while mitogen responses remain intact. In secondary immunodeficiency, specific antigen responses will also generally be suppressed more easily than mitogen responses. However, these generalizations are not always true [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. As with DTH testing, booster immunization with tetanus followed by a repeat in vitro proliferation assay may detect a significant response.</p><p>Another way to assess function of T cells is to measure cytokine release following antigen exposure.

Special tests involving western blotting or flow cytometry can pinpoint the exact molecular defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Defects in PRRs can cause increased susceptibility to infections that is most severe in infancy, before the adaptive (ie, humoral and cellular) immune system has developed. The frequency and severity of infections generally lessen as the patient matures, in contrast to most other types of immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of the innate immune system&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The toll-like receptors (TLRs) are one group of PRRs that, after ligation with specific micro-organisms, initiate a series of steps that eventually activate the nucleus to initiate cytokine synthesis. Several genetic disorders of the signaling pathways have been identified, including an IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 defect (IRAK4), a myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 defect (MYD88), a nuclear factor (NF)-kappa-B essential modulator defect (NEMO), a TLR3 receptor defect, and a UNC93B defect. Screening tests to evaluate these defects are available, including a flow cytometric assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].

These studies can be used to try to identify molecular defects in patients with a primary immunodeficiency in which the genetic basis is not defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system/abstract/34-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-44</a>]. These techniques are largely performed at research centers, but availability is likely to expand. Older techniques such as linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping worked well for identifying monogenic traits, particularly in patients with syndromic features, although a large pedigree (or several smaller pedigrees) is needed. Microarray methods of comparative genomic hybridization can detect relatively large areas of gain or loss of copy number and may identify clinically relevant changes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=next-generation-dna-sequencing-ngs-principles-and-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Targeted NGS is a cost-effective method to screen for defects in known primary immunodeficiency-associated genes. It can identify patients with atypical presentations of known genetic defects and can also be used to identify the defect in patients with a primary immunodeficiency that has multiple associated candidate genes. WES is usually performed next if targeted NGS screening is negative.</p><p>WES assesses about 2 percent of the genome that encompasses most of the coding genes (the exons), while WGS includes the entire genome including the introns. Thus, WES is less laborious, less expensive, and usually as informative as WGS. Both are used for identifying rare genetic defects, particularly in patients with early-onset severe disease. The underlying biology does not need to be understood.</p><p>These techniques also work well if several genes are involved (polygenic traits), although analysis can be challenging and laborious in that circumstance. Mutations identified by NGS methods still require further study to determine the biologic effects of the mutations identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H790564315\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

In infants and children, height and weight records should be reviewed to detect failure to thrive and poor growth. Routine laboratories can provide clues about other causes of infections and help focus further immunologic evaluation. Screening laboratories include complete blood count (CBC) with differential, chemistry panels, urinalysis, test to diagnose specific organ involvement (eg, sinus computed tomography [CT] or chest radiograph), and C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate to look for elevations that may accompany chronic infections. (See <a href=\"#H19688153\" class=\"local\">'Initial approach to the patient'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunologic testing is best performed in a graded fashion, and referral to an <span class=\"nowrap\">allergist/immunologist</span> should be sought early in the process, when possible, because many tests require varying degrees of expertise to perform and interpret, may not be widely available, and are often costly. (See <a href=\"#H22450812\" class=\"local\">'Referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Defects in humoral immunity, which account for about 65 percent of primary immunodeficiencies, usually result in recurrent and severe sinopulmonary infections with encapsulated bacterial strains. Immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin M (IgM) should be measured initially. The next step in evaluation is the measurement of serum-specific antibody titers (IgG) in response to intentional immunization (vaccine response) or natural infection. (See <a href=\"#H17005404\" class=\"local\">'Antibody deficiency and defects'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessing the immunologic response to vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Defects in cellular immune function (T cell disorders) are often accompanied by antibody defects, yielding combined immunodeficiencies. Isolated cellular defects and combined defects together account for about 20 percent of primary immunodeficiencies. These disorders should be considered in any child presenting with recurrent or severe viral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bacterial illnesses or opportunistic infections in the first year of life. Presentation in adulthood is uncommon, although it does occur. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Defects in cellular immunity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lymphopenia is an early indicator of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in infants and of combined immunodeficiencies in older children and occasionally adults. This should be followed by flow cytometry to determine which lymphocyte subsets are deficient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78061\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78061 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F110585\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110585 \">table 4</a>). In most cases, the evaluation should be repeated at several points in time, as viral infections and other factors can influence lymphocyte counts.

For these reasons, DTH testing can be used as a simple and economical means to exclude a defect in cellular immunity in adults and older children. However, negative results must be interpreted with caution, because there are multiple reasons for nonresponse.

Mitogen responses may be assessed in patients of any age, regardless of immunization status. Specific antigen tests are only useful in patients who have been previously immunized to that antigen, but may be more sensitive than mitogen assays as indicators of defects in T cell function. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'In vitro studies of T cell function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Advanced tests for T cell deficiencies may include cytokine levels, cytokine release assays, autoimmune anti-cytokine antibodies, radiosensitivity assays, and cytotoxic assays using human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched target cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary phagocytic cell deficiencies, which account for about 10 percent of primary immunodeficiencies, characteristically lead to recurrent and severe fungal (eg, <em>Candida</em> and <em>Aspergillus</em>) and bacterial infections. The most common sites of infection are the respiratory tract and skin, but deep tissue and organ abscesses are also seen. Initial testing for these disorders is the CBC with differential, followed by various specific tests of phagocyte function, depending upon the disorder suspected. (See <a href=\"#H5551356\" class=\"local\">'Neutrophil defects (defects in phagocyte function)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complement defects should be considered in patients with recurrent pyogenic infections with normal white blood cell counts and immunoglobulins and in patients with a personal or family history of recurrent neisserial infections. A total hemolytic complement (CH50) is the initial screening test. (See <a href=\"#H5551391\" class=\"local\">'Complement defects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Defects in innate immune mechanisms are rare disorders that should be suspected in patients with recurrent infections, often of a specific type (eg, herpes viruses), in which other immunodeficiencies have been excluded.
