The procedure is centuries old and continues to be performed for a variety of religious, cultural, and medical reasons.</p><p>Parents of newborn males often have questions about circumcision: Is it necessary? What are its benefits? What are its risks? In addition to these medical issues, other factors that influence parental decision-making include the father's circumcision status, opinions of family members and friends, a desire for conformity in their son's appearance, and the belief that the circumcised penis is easier to keep clean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. </p><p>The risks and benefits of circumcision will be reviewed here, with the focus on circumcision of neonates. Procedures for neonatal circumcision are discussed separately.

Circumcision rates in the United States vary according to geographic area, socioeconomic status, religious affiliation, insurance coverage, hospital type, and racial and ethnic group. The overall prevalence is estimated to be about 80 percent for males aged 14 to 59 years, with most of these procedures performed in newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Circumcision rates are highest in the Midwestern states (74 percent), followed by the Northeastern states (67 percent) and Southern states (61 percent), and are lowest in the Western states (30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The rate is higher in non-Hispanic whites (91 percent) than in non-Hispanic blacks (76 percent) and Mexican Americans (44 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Circumcision rates outside of the United States vary widely, from less than 5 percent to over 90 percent of males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>There are no studies that give reliable data about the number of males who are circumcised after birth for elective or surgical indications. An Australian survey found that approximately 18 percent of males who were not circumcised as infants reported that they were circumcised subsequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">COUNSELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parents should receive factually correct, nonbiased information about the potential medical benefits and risks of neonatal circumcision and should understand that the procedure is elective. This discussion needs to consider the social, cultural, and religious aspects of the procedure, and the parents&rsquo; personal preferences, which may be more important to them than a decision based on medical benefits alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/1-3,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,9,10</a>]. In cross-sectional studies performed in the United States, 40 to 67 percent of parents reported they chose to have their son circumcised because of its hygienic and medical benefits; 23 to 37 percent had the procedure performed for social reasons (eg, father circumcised); and 11 to 19 percent of procedures were performed for religious reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>].</p><p>Ideally, counseling is provided when parents first begin to consider circumcision, which may be early in pregnancy or before. Written informed consent is obtained prior to the procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-for-neonatal-circumcision#H1016964206\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques for neonatal circumcision&quot;, section on 'Informed consent'</a>.)</p><p>Parents who are considering deferring circumcision until their son reaches an age where he can make an informed decision should be informed that circumcision performed in adults has greater risks and costs, more postprocedure discomfort, and a longer recovery period than newborn circumcision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. It also delays protection from sexually transmitted infections, which is important if the male becomes sexually active before the procedure is performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">POTENTIAL BENEFITS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Circumcision has been associated with a number of medical benefits, including lower rates of urinary tract infection (UTI), penile cancer, penile inflammation, penile dermatoses, and sexually transmitted infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>]. A lower rate of UTI is the major benefit during infancy. </p><p>In the uncircumcised male, the preputial space provides a warm moist environment that both traps pathogens and bodily secretions and is favorable to their survival and replication, while the foreskin itself is susceptible to microabrasions that are thought to facilitate acquisition and transmission of infection. In contrast, the keratinized glans of the circumcised male is thought to create an unfavorable environment for these processes. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduction in urinary tract infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UTI is uncommon in males at any age. The effect of circumcision on UTI has been studied primarily in infants because they have a higher prevalence of UTI than older males. UTIs in infants can result in pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization and, rarely, septicemia and death. In infants with congenital uropathy, UTI can have serious sequelae, such as renal scarring and lifelong renal insufficiency. If the urinary tract is normal, long-term sequelae from UTI are unlikely. </p><p>Comparative studies consistently report that circumcised male infants have significantly fewer UTIs than uncircumcised male infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]; however, there are no data from a large randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In a systematic review of 12 studies including data on over 400,000 males primarily under 1 year of age, circumcision reduced the risk of UTI by almost 90 percent (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.08-0.20) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Another meta-analysis found that among febrile male infants less than 3 months of age, the prevalence of UTI in circumcised and uncircumcised infants was 2.4 and 20.1 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. It is estimated that 7 to 14 of 1000 uncircumcised male infants will develop a UTI during the first year of life, compared with 1 to 2 of 1000 circumcised male infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As discussed above, long-term sequelae from UTI are unlikely if the urinary tract is normal. </p><p>There is some evidence that periurethral flora contains fewer pathogens after circumcision than before circumcision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Uncircumcised male infants under 6 months of age have higher numbers of uropathogenic bacteria bound to the mucosal surface of the foreskin and at the urethral meatus than infants who have been circumcised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This colonization probably plays a role in the pathogenesis of urinary infection. However, factors other than circumcision may affect the observed rate of UTI in these reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. As an example, most hospitalized premature infants are not circumcised. Since premature infants have a higher rate of UTI than term infants, the inclusion of premature infants in a series may confound the data. Other factors that can affect UTI rates include the method of urine collection, type and timing of circumcision, and breastfeeding status (protective effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]).</p><p>The reduction in UTI associated with circumcision has also been observed after infancy. In a 2013 systematic review of primarily unrandomized studies, adult uncircumcised men had a higher rate of UTI than circumcised men (RR 3.4, 95% CI 0.92-12.7) and the lifetime risk of UTI in uncircumcised and circumcised men was 32.1 and 8.8 percent, respectively (RR RR 3.65, 95% CI 1.15-11.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Lack of circumcision was estimated to account for 23 percent of UTIs during the lifetime of males.</p><p>The prevalence of UTIs in uncircumcised adult males increases with age and certain disease states, such as diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in men&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-children-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infections in children: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Lack of circumcision'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113620170\"><span class=\"h3\">Infants with congenital uropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In male infants with serious congenital uropathies such as high grade vesicoureteral reflux, posterior urethral valves, megaureters, and prune belly syndrome, reduction in urinary tract infections by circumcision may have greater potential benefit. Prospective randomized trials have not been performed, but the retrospective evidence described above supports this hypothesis. In my practice, I tell families that a circumcision has the potential to be beneficial, especially when the baby has an associated uropathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduction in risk of some cancers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compared to uncircumcised men, circumcised men appear to have a lower risk of penile cancer, and their sexual partners may have a lower risk of cervical cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Penile cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Squamous cell cancer of the penis is a rare disease. The age-adjusted incidence in the United States is less than 1 per 100,000 males, comparable to that in other developed countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. </p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis found a strong protective effect of <span class=\"nowrap\">childhood/adolescent</span> circumcision on invasive penile cancer (OR&nbsp;0.33; 95% CI 0.13-0.83; 3 studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In two studies, the protective effect did not persist when analyses were restricted to boys with no history of phimosis, suggesting at least some of the increased risk of cancer is related to phimosis, which can be the result of poor penile hygiene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. There was no association between circumcision and penile intraepithelial neoplasia and in situ penile cancer.</p><p>The number of newborn circumcisions that would need to be performed to prevent one case of penile cancer has been estimated to range from 909 to 322,000, and 2 to 644 complications would be expected per cancer prevented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Given the low risk of penile cancer and the possibly modest reduction in risk with circumcision, it is unclear whether this benefit is clinically important when evaluated against the cost of the procedure and the risk of procedure related complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carcinoma-of-the-penis-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-pathology#H282027087\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carcinoma of the penis: Epidemiology, risk factors, and pathology&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.) Furthermore, these data were obtained prior to widespread use of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine for girls, as well as boys. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus vaccination&quot;</a>.) Vaccination may reduce the prevalence of HPV related disease, diminishing the role of circumcision in prevention of these diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Cervical cancer in partners</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical cancer is more common in the sexual partners of uncircumcised men. A partial explanation for the link between cervical cancer and lack of male circumcision is that circumcised men have a lower prevalence of HPV infection than uncircumcised men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], they are less likely to transmit HPV to their partners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], and their partners have lower high-risk HPV DNA load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>In a study that pooled data from 1913 couples enrolled in one of seven case-control studies, circumcised men were less likely than uncircumcised men to have HPV infection (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16-0.85 after adjustment of confounders) and male circumcision was associated with a trend for reduced risk of cervical HPV and cervical cancer (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.49-1.14) in the female partner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Among monogamous women, the reduced risk of cervical cancer was statistically significant when the male partner had engaged in high-risk sexual behaviors (early age at first sexual intercourse, a high lifetime number of sexual partners, sexual intercourse with prostitutes) (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04-0.89) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

The best available data were reported by a prospective cohort study of 635 New Zealand boys followed from birth to age 8 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The rates of penile inflammation and phimosis were higher in uncircumcised boys (penile inflammation: 14.4 versus 7.6 per 100 boys 0 to 8 years of age; phimosis 3.7 versus 0 per 100 boys 0 to 8 years of age). </p><p>Properly performed neonatal circumcision prevents phimosis, paraphimosis and balanoposthitis. A reduction in penile inflammatory and retractile disorders is important because, although they can often be treated medically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>], chronic inflammation and repeated forceful retraction may cause scarring and secondary phimosis, which sometimes requires surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/7,8,29,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,29,45</a>]. However, good penile hygiene also may prevent penile inflammatory and retractile disorders, highlighting the importance of teaching uncircumcised boys routine penile care and hygiene.

Good hygiene may prevent many problems associated with the foreskin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], but can be difficult to maintain in uncircumcised boys, even in developed countries.

Other groups oppose circumcision on a human rights basis, saying the infant is not allowed to decide whether or not he wants to be circumcised and the procedure constitutes genital mutilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In 2012, a German court in Cologne ruled that circumcising young boys represents grievous bodily harm, but was overruled by a higher court.

Compared to their previous statement, this statement is a stronger affirmation of the health benefits of circumcision. However, the AAP did not recommend routine circumcision.

The prevalence varies across the world. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence and epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parents of newborn males should be provided with accurate, unbiased, written information about the potential risks and benefits of circumcision. This information should be in a language that they understand and they should have the opportunity to discuss this information with the operating practitioner prior to deciding whether or not to have their infant son circumcised. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We educate parents about neonatal circumcision, as we believe the health benefits of circumcision outweigh the risks. Benefits of circumcision in men include reduction in the rates of urinary tract infection (UTI), penile cancer, some sexually transmitted infections, penile inflammatory and retractile disorders, as well as easier hygiene. These benefits, which extend over a lifetime, need to be weighed against the potential risks of the circumcision procedure, which are often short-term, and in the context of the low incidence of UTIs and penile cancer in uncircumcised men. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Potential benefits'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circumcision protects the male from acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papillomavirus (HPV), and probably herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). There is also some evidence that it may protect against trichomonas and chancroid infection. Male circumcision also confers benefits to female partners by reductions in cervical cancer and acquisition of some sexually transmitted infections and bacterial vaginosis. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Cervical cancer in partners'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections#H757409080\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of sexually transmitted infections&quot;, section on 'Male circumcision'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Procedure-related complications are uncommon, and serious complications are rare.
