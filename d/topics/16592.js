They are ideally treated by a team that includes a rheumatologist, a hand therapist, and a hand surgeon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-in-patients-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-of-the-hand/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Initially, every effort is made to preserve function and to regain motion nonsurgically. This is done by mobilizing tissues, using exercises to increase range of motion, and using appropriate splinting.</p><p>However, selected surgery may be helpful in relieving pain and in restoring function. Examples of problems for which surgery may be indicated, as well as the types of procedure, include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-in-patients-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-of-the-hand/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcinosis may be treated by excision or curettage.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interphalangeal (IP) joint fusions and metacarpophalangeal joint replacements may correct severe flexion deformities and may improve grasp.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sympathectomy or vein bypass grafting may improve circulation to ischemic digits.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Digital ulcers may be excised, combined with correction of severe flexion deformities.</p><p/><p>The decreased circulation and tight skin, which is characteristic of patients with systemic sclerosis, present significant challenges to surgical treatment.</p><p>Common patterns of deformity of the hands of patients with scleroderma and the surgical approaches for treatment of digital ulcers, calcific deposits, finger and thumb deformities, and ischemic digits are presented here. Clinical manifestations and medical management of scleroderma are presented separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-and-prognosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment and prognosis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) in adults&quot;</a>). The medical management of Raynaud phenomenon, which is a nearly universal problem in patients with scleroderma, is also presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of the Raynaud phenomenon&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon-resistant-to-initial-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the Raynaud phenomenon resistant to initial therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFORMITY PATTERNS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three deformities are commonly found in patients with limited or diffuse scleroderma involving the hands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-in-patients-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-of-the-hand/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The most frequent is a flexion contracture of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. Hyperextension of the PIP (swan neck) and contracture of the skin and muscle between the thumb and the second metacarpal are less frequently observed. Untreated, progressive PIP flexion deformities may lead to hyperextension at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Proximal interphalangeal joint flexion contracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progressive development of PIP joint flexion contractures may lead to thinning or rupture of the extensor mechanism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F79794\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79794 \">picture 1</a>). The skin over these joints may blanch and, ultimately, may break down, exposing the underlying tendon or joint. Joint infection or osteomyelitis may result, further complicating management. Therefore, protecting areas of skin breakdown before surgical correction is critical. This usually includes frequent dressing changes and splinting the joint to limit motion and to avoid additional flexion.</p><p>Increasing flexion of the PIP joint results in compensatory hyperextension at the metacarpophalangeal joint. Initially, the MCP joints maintain active flexion. Over time, however, the collateral ligaments, joint capsule, and overlying skin contract and severely limit MCP joint flexion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Proximal interphalangeal hyperextension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperextension of the PIP joint is secondary to the development of MCP joint subluxation in flexion. This condition is similar to the swan neck deformity observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F64627\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64627 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-in-patients-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-of-the-hand/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>). As patients lose their ability to extend the fingers at the MCP level, they compensate by hyperextending the PIP joints. Although the skin over the hyperextended PIP joints is contracted, it usually does not break down. By comparison, a prominent metacarpal head can erode the skin overlying MCP joints.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Contracture between thumb and index finger</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contracture of the first web space between the thumb and index finger reduces thumb mobility. This abnormality diminishes the ability of the patient to grasp large objects between the thumb and index fingers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-in-patients-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-of-the-hand/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the technical challenges presented by poor circulation and by thickened and inelastic skin, some problems affecting the hands of patients with scleroderma are best treated by surgical intervention. These include skin ulceration, calcific deposits, deformities which interfere with function or contribute to skin breakdown, and severe ischemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin ulcerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ulceration of the skin may occur at the fingertip <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> over joints. Skin breakdown at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) or metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints results from a combination of decreased circulation and pressure from underlying bone prominences, which are often due to joint deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-in-patients-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-of-the-hand/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Fingertips</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe ischemia of the fingertips may lead to ulceration or gangrene. If frank skin necrosis has not yet occurred, medical management based upon the administration of calcium channel blocking agents, prostaglandins, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transdermal nitroglycerine should be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon-resistant-to-initial-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the Raynaud phenomenon resistant to initial therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, healing is slow once skin and soft tissue necrosis and ulceration develop. The underlying distal phalangeal tufts can resorb. If gangrene ultimately develops, auto amputation may occur, or surgical amputation may be necessary.</p><p>These ulcerations are also treated with local topical antibiotics, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-sulfadiazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver sulfadiazine</a>. Secondary infections are most often due to <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, but wound cultures help guide appropriate antibiotic therapy. These lesions are frequently extremely painful and may require the use of potent analgesics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open wounds occurring over the PIP and MCP joints can progress to deep infections. With patience, however, many open areas spontaneously heal and should, therefore, initially be treated conservatively. Frequent dressing changes, occasional debridement, and protective splinting are the mainstays of conservative therapy. Range of motion exercises should be curtailed until ulcerations have healed because of the risk of joint sepsis or osteomyelitis, if overly vigorous exercise should lead to rupture of the extensor hood. In some cases, however, resection of a bony prominence or joint fusion may be the only way to heal open wounds.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcinosis cutis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcinosis cutis, which can be intracutaneous or subcutaneous, occurs in approximately 15 and 44 percent of patients with the diffuse type of systemic sclerosis and with the limited cutaneous type, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F60100\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60100 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-in-patients-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-of-the-hand/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Calcium deposits can occur within one digit or throughout the hand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-in-patients-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-of-the-hand/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The deposits are firm and produce tender areas in the finger pulp that may interfere with the ability to pick up objects. They can spontaneously extrude calcific material, which can also be removed surgically from the distal pulp.</p><p>In areas with digital nerves in close proximity to such deposits, careful removal is usually performed, with a curette rather than with a scalpel. The use of a high-speed dental burr has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-in-patients-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-of-the-hand/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Irrigation with saline solution may also be used to safely remove calcific material. Occasionally, after curetting the calcium deposit, the fingertips are left open to allow spontaneous healing rather than using sutures through compromised skin. In most cases, a partial removal or debulking may be enough to relieve the patient's symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-in-patients-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-of-the-hand/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Finger and thumb deformities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery may be helpful at the distal interphalangeal (DIP), PIP, and MCP joints of the fingers and at the interphalangeal (IP) and MCP joints of the thumb. Release of contractures of the first web space (between the thumb and index finger) may help improve function, particularly grasping.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Distal interphalangeal joint</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery of the DIP joints most commonly consists of either amputation or fusion. Amputations may be required if the patient has gangrene, osteomyelitis of the distal phalanx, or a septic DIP joint. This surgery is best done with the patient under regional anesthesia with tourniquet release before closure to ensure the presence of adequate circulation. The skin flaps are closed loosely to avoid any compromise of the skin.</p><p>DIP joint fusions are performed either to correct severe deformity or to provide stability. Longitudinal Kirschner wire fixation with the joint in the neutral position is the simplest and safest form of internal fixation. However, any surgery at the distal level with diminished circulation is risky because of the possibility of postoperative gangrene and the need for subsequent amputation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Proximal interphalangeal joint</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some surgeons have attempted Swanson flexible implant arthroplasties at the PIP joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-in-patients-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-of-the-hand/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, the ultimate gain in motion in these reported cases has been small. In addition, the amount of bone resection required to allow prosthetic insertion may lead to considerable digital shortening. Most surgeons think that fusion is the procedure of choice for the common fixed PIP joint flexion contracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-in-patients-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-of-the-hand/abstract/5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12</a>].</p><p>Because the circulation at the PIP level is better than that in the distal part of the finger, it is possible to operate with less risk at the PIP joint. Although not ideal, even infected or exposed joints may be approached surgically. Skin and bone resection (the latter as part of the fusion procedure) allows primary closure in most cases.</p><p>The optimum position of PIP fusion varies with each digit. Thirty degrees of flexion is ideal in the index finger and increases to 45 degrees in the small finger.</p><p>The overall functional result of a PIP joint fusion is determined by the range of motion of the MCP joints. With good MCP function, the PIP joints can be fused in less flexion. If MCP motion is reduced, it should be regained surgically by either capsulotomy or arthroplasty before proceeding with PIP joint fusions.</p><p>Crossed K wires are used to achieve fixation, and the fingers are splinted until healing is achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-in-patients-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-of-the-hand/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. With severe flexion contractures, an intraoperative circulatory problem may develop as the digit is straightened. In this setting, it may be necessary either to accept less correction or to perform a digital sympathectomy to improve the circulation and to preserve the correction (see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-in-patients-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-of-the-hand/abstract/7,8,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Metacarpophalangeal joint</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Circulation approaches normal levels at the MCP joint among patients with scleroderma. Since the area is often warm to palpation, the surgeon has the ability to do more extensive surgery with the prospect of normal wound healing. However, tightness of the dorsal skin poses a significant problem, with the attempt to achieve additional flexion surgically. Although it is possible to insert flexible implant prostheses at this level, the risks are increased over resection arthroplasty, a technique which can also restore satisfactory motion.</p><p>In patients with severe ulnar deviation and MCP flexion, a standard dorsal approach is used. However, the situation is different with shortened dorsal skin and fixed MCP hyperextension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F65112\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65112 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F80307\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80307 \">image 2</a>). Faced with this dilemma, we have approached the metacarpal heads via a palmar approach and have carried out a wide resection of the metacarpal heads (to restore flexion) combined with PIP fusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F73054\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73054 \">image 3</a>). In our experience, considerable remodeling of the metacarpal heads after resection has been observed, which makes this technique a viable alternative to implant surgery in patients with MCP joint involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F62194\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62194 \">image 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">First web space</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another area treated surgically in patients with systemic sclerosis is the tight first web space between the thumb and index finger. Opening the web space and releasing the tight deeper structures may require release of a tight adductor attachment to the thumb and the addition of a skin graft. Selected fusions of the IP joint or MCP joint of the thumb also are helpful when deformities reduce the ability to achieve an adequate thumb index pinch. In some patients, resection of the trapezium may be required to restore abduction of the thumb.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Digital ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical approaches to improve digital circulation have focused upon attempts to decrease the sympathetic innervation of the digital vessels. Various techniques to strip the adventitia of the common digital arteries in the palm have been described (selective digital sympathectomy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-in-patients-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-of-the-hand/abstract/7,8,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,14-17</a>]. Via a volar transverse incision, the common digital arteries are exposed. With microscopic technique, the adventitia is stripped over a 1 cm portion of each artery. The extent of adventitial stripping described by some clinicians is much more than that of others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-in-patients-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-of-the-hand/abstract/7,8,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,14-17</a>]. Each of these techniques results in temporary improvement in digital blood flow with increases in skin temperature and improvement in the healing of fingertip ulcers.</p><p>Some surgeons thoroughly investigate digital circulation in patients with systemic sclerosis by several methods including digital plethysmography, cold stress testing, and intraarterial digital subtraction angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-in-patients-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-of-the-hand/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Cold stress testing involves measurement of digital temperature, pulse volume readings, or laser Doppler flow values of the digits before and during exposure of the hands in a cold environment, as well as during subsequent rewarming. During surgery, the surgeon inspects the entire superficial palmar arch, looking for segmental occlusions to determine need for resection interpositional vein grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-in-patients-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-of-the-hand/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. They also search for constrictive fibrous tissue around the small vessels that can be excised. Unfortunately, some patients undergoing this &quot;decompressive arteriolysis&quot; continue to have pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to develop recurrent ulcerations within two years of their surgery. However, it is an exciting approach for the treatment of diminished distal circulation in patients with systemic sclerosis.</p><p>While digital sympathectomy with or without decompressive arteriolysis may be helpful to some patients, adverse outcomes with surgery are frequent. A 2003 systematic review of outcomes of such surgery included 65 patients with digital ischemia due to scleroderma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-in-patients-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-of-the-hand/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Following digital sympathectomy, subsequent surgical amputation, postoperative ulceration, and other complications (delayed wound healing, autoamputation, inflexibility at the PIP joint, infection, chronic pain, and keloid formation) developed in 15, 16, and 42 percent, respectively, of those operated upon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11412795\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite the technical challenges presented by poor circulation and by thickened and inelastic skin, some problems affecting the hands of patients with scleroderma are best treated by surgical intervention, which may relieve pain and restore function.
