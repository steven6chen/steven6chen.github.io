The liver is a big organ in the upper right side of the belly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64960 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>There are two types of NAFLD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonalcoholic fatty liver (also called NAFL) &ndash; In NAFL, the liver has fat buildup, but is <strong>not</strong> inflamed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (also called NASH) &ndash; In NASH, the liver has fat buildup and <strong>is</strong> inflamed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This article is mostly about NASH, because that is the condition that can lead to the most problems.</p><p/><p>People who drink too much alcohol can get a condition similar to NASH. But NASH happens in people who do not drink alcohol or drink only a little alcohol.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21262055\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes NASH?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors do not know what causes NASH. They do know that NASH happens more often in some people, such as those who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are overweight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a condition called diabetes mellitus, which causes blood sugar levels to get too high</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have high cholesterol</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take certain medicines</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21262062\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of NASH?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with NASH have no symptoms.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse might suspect that you have NASH from the results of your routine blood tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21262069\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need more tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse suspects that you have NASH, you will likely have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An imaging test of the liver, such as an ultrasound, CT, or MRI scan &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p>Some people need a liver biopsy. During this test, a doctor removes a small sample of tissue from the liver. Then another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope to see if NASH is present. A liver biopsy is the only test that can tell for sure if you have NASH. Your doctor might do this test if he or she is not sure if you have NASH or to see how much inflammation there is in the liver. If your blood tests and imaging tests are normal you will not need a liver biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21262076\"><span class=\"h1\">How is NASH treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NASH is not treated directly. But the condition can get better when other medical conditions that often happen with NASH get treated. For example, losing weight, and controlling high blood sugar and cholesterol can help improve NASH.</p><p>With that in mind, your doctor can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Help you create a weight loss plan, if you are overweight &ndash; If your doctor recommends that you lose weight, it's important to do so slowly. Do not lose more than 3.5 pounds (1.6 kilograms) a week.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat your high blood sugar, if you have high blood sugar</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat your high cholesterol, if you have high cholesterol</p><p/><p>Making these changes has benefits besides helping with NASH. These changes can also reduce your chances of having a heart attack or stroke. That's important because people with NASH are often also at risk for heart disease and stroke.</p><p>If you take a medicine that could be causing NASH, your doctor will stop or change that medicine.</p><p>If you have a severe form of NASH but do not also have diabetes or heart disease, your doctor or nurse might suggest that you take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin E</a>. A few studies suggest that vitamin E can reduce some of the liver damage that occurs as part of NASH. On the other hand, there are also studies that suggest that high doses of vitamin E increase the risk of death. So do not take vitamin E unless your doctor or nurse recommends it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21262083\"><span class=\"h1\">Does NASH get worse over time?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NASH does not usually get worse over time. But sometimes it leads to serious scarring of the liver, called &quot;cirrhosis.&quot; Cirrhosis can cause different symptoms, such as swelling in the legs, trouble breathing, or feeling tired. If you get cirrhosis, your doctor will talk with you about different possible treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21262090\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to follow up with my doctor?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. People who have NASH need to see their doctor for regular check-ups. Your doctor will do follow-up tests on a regular basis. These usually include blood tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21262097\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-treatments-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Weight loss treatments (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-for-type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Treatment for type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High cholesterol (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cirrhosis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld-including-nonalcoholic-steatohepatitis-nash-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-treatments-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Weight loss treatments (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-2-overview-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 2: Overview (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-2-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 2: Treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-and-lipids-hyperlipidemia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High cholesterol and lipids (hyperlipidemia) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Cirrhosis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
