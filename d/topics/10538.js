Proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) lesions often supply a high percentage of the left ventricular myocardium, compared to proximal lesions in the circumflex or right coronary arteries. A study reported that the prevalence of significant proximal LAD disease in stable patients undergoing diagnostic coronary catheterization was 7.2 percent in New York State and 13.4 percent in Ontario, Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-significant-proximal-left-anterior-descending-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss both the choice between medical therapy and revascularization for treatment of proximal LAD disease in stable patients as well as the choice between coronary artery bypass graft surgery and percutaneous coronary intervention in those patients in whom revascularization is chosen. This discussion will focus on the outcomes of survival, myocardial infarction, and revascularization rates. Revascularization to improve angina refractory to medical therapy in patients for whom survival will not be improved is discussed separately.

In addition, revascularization should be preferred to medical therapy in many such patients who have certain high-risk predictors, such as a large amount of viable myocardium at risk, as determined by stress testing with or without noninvasive imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-significant-proximal-left-anterior-descending-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>] or significant underlying left ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-significant-proximal-left-anterior-descending-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The indication for revascularization is less certain for patients with low-risk findings on noninvasive testing in patients who are receiving no or minimal anti-ischemic medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-significant-proximal-left-anterior-descending-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Thus, recommendations are based on extrapolation from trials comparing medical therapy with revascularization in broader populations, such as those with multivessel disease and a large area of myocardium at risk or significant underlying left ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-significant-proximal-left-anterior-descending-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].

Among patients with one or two vessel disease, including the proximal LAD, CABG was associated with a significant reduction in five-year mortality (9 versus 15 percent with medical therapy, odds ratio 0.58). In comparison, patients with one or two vessel disease without proximal LAD involvement did equally well with medical therapy.</p><p/><p>Another trial using contemporary medical therapy, COURAGE, included a small group of patients with isolated proximal LAD disease. In COURAGE, which excluded patients with severe angina, a markedly positive treadmill test (significant ST-segment depressions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a hypotensive blood pressure response during stage I of the Bruce protocol) and a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30 percent, there was no significant difference between aggressive medical therapy or aggressive medical therapy plus percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stenting. Because COURAGE excluded many patients with proximal LAD disease with a large area of myocardium at risk, we do not believe its conclusions apply.

In these patients, survival is likely to be better with revascularization. For patients without prior placement of a left internal thoracic artery, CABG is preferred to PCI. </p><p>Patients with ischemia in other locations and those with a patent left internal mammary artery to the LAD artery are unlikely to experience a survival benefit from repeat revascularization, and the decision to revascularize should be made primarily on the basis of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-significant-proximal-left-anterior-descending-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

We prefer PCI with stenting in many patients with less complex coronary artery disease and relatively well preserved left ventricular systolic function. CABG might be preferred to PCI in patients with complex, proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) disease with other unfavorable lesions (eg, chronic total occlusion in another vessel). Other patient and angiographic characteristics also may affect the decision such as age, left ventricular dysfunction, the inability to take or tolerate dual antiplatelet therapy for an appropriate duration, and diabetes mellitus (in which the outcome may be better with CABG).

Long-term survival was similar but revascularization rates were higher with PTCA compared to CABG in the broad group of patients with multivessel disease. However, PTCA without stenting is now rarely performed.

When faced with more complex lesions such as true ostial location, particularly with involvement of the distal left main coronary artery, adjacent circumflex ostial disease, or complex bifurcation lesions involving a large first diagonal branch, consideration of CABG should be made. Complex LAD-diagonal bifurcation lesions and ostial LAD lesions that are flush with the distal left main should only be attempted by highly experienced operators in institutions with cardiac surgical facilities. When PCI with stenting is performed, drug-eluting stents (DES) are preferred in most patients because of a marked reduction in the incidence of restenosis compared to bare metal stents, including patients with proximal LAD disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-significant-proximal-left-anterior-descending-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].

Earlier stent versus CABG trials in patients with multivessel disease, including the proximal LAD, have shown similar long-term survival but higher rates of repeat target vessel revascularization with stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-significant-proximal-left-anterior-descending-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/25-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-30</a>]. Few of these patients in these trials had a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30 percent.

After 12 months of follow-up, the composite primary end point (death from any cause, stroke, MI, or repeat revascularization) was significantly higher in the PCI group (17.8 versus 12.4 percent), with the result driven primarily by more frequent revascularization with PCI (13.5 versus 5.9 percent). After five years, however, CABG was also associated with fewer myocardial infarctions (MIs) and the lower rate of the composite outcome of death, stroke, or MI. This trial is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=revascularization-in-patients-with-stable-coronary-artery-disease-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-versus-percutaneous-coronary-intervention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Revascularization in patients with stable coronary artery disease: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery versus percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;</a>.)<br/><br/>Patients with lower SYNTAX scores had lower event rates than those with intermediate or high scores. Secondary analyses suggested that among patients with low SYNTAX scores, the clinical outcomes were comparable with PCI and CABG, whereas in patients with higher SYNTAX score, outcomes were better with CABG. The SYNTAX score predicts a higher long-term risk with proximal LAD disease than with either proximal circumflex or right coronary artery disease.

This preference is based on the desire to avoid the potential complications of CABG (such as stroke) despite a higher rate of repeat revascularization with PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-significant-proximal-left-anterior-descending-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. The prevalence of significant proximal LAD disease in stable patients undergoing diagnostic coronary catheterization was found to be 7.2 percent in New York State and 13.4 percent in Ontario, Canada in a 2013 study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-significant-proximal-left-anterior-descending-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>As discussed above, this finding is sometimes, but not always, an absolute indication for revascularization, since clinical trials have not shown a survival benefit compared to medical therapy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Indications for revascularization'</a> above.) The main indication for intervention in this setting is for symptoms due to failure of medical therapy. However, given the safety and low procedural morbidity associated with PCI and stenting, most cardiologists favor revascularization of the proximal LAD given the large area at risk. &#160;</p><p>A 2008 meta-analysis of nine randomized trials, including 1210 patients, found no 5- or 10-year survival difference between CABG and PCI for management of single vessel LAD disease, although rates of repeat revascularization were higher at five years with PCI (33.5 versus 7.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-significant-proximal-left-anterior-descending-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

The studies evaluated in these meta-analyses used predominantly <strong>bare metal stents</strong>. </p><p>Randomized trials using a lateral or anterolateral thoracotomy (MID CABG) in patients with isolated LAD stenosis have suggested that this surgical approach is associated with equivalent mortality but better symptom control and a lower rate of target vessel revascularization than PCI with <strong>bare metal stents</strong> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-significant-proximal-left-anterior-descending-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].</p><p>Two studies have compared PCI with <strong>drug-eluting stents</strong> (DES) to CABG:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial comparing first generation DES to minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery (MIDCAB) evaluated outcomes in 130 patients with isolated proximal LAD disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-significant-proximal-left-anterior-descending-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The primary clinical end point was freedom from death, MI, or the need for target vessel revascularization. At one year, PCI with DES was noninferior to MIDCAB, with an event rate of 7.7 percent in both groups. Patients who received PCI had a higher rate of revascularization (6.2 versus 0 percent), while those who received MIDCAB had a higher rate of MI (7.7 versus 1.5 percent), most of which was periprocedural.

The rate of repeat revascularization was significantly lower for CABG (AHR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36-0.81). The stents used in these patients, although not reported in the publication, were likely represented by a majority of second generation DES, which have improved results compared with first generation DES and represent the standard of care at present.</p><p/><p>In the patient with severe single vessel disease involving only the proximal LAD, it is important for the patient to be made aware of the strengths and weakness of either approach.

For these patients with multivessel disease who have a LVEF &lt;30 percent, we suggest CABG rather than PCI (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

However, for those patients who prefer to accept the higher early morbidity (including an increased risk of stroke) with CABG in exchange for a lower rate of subsequent revascularization, CABG is an appropriate strategy.

This information may influence decision making between PCI and CABG.
