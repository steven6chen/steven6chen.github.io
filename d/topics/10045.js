(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-for-the-secondary-prevention-of-atherosclerotic-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin for the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>All patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), including those treated with balloon angioplasty without stenting, receive dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), which is the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and a P2Y<sub>12 </sub>receptor blocker to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) or cardiovascular death. DAPT likely decreases the risk of these ischemic events by preventing stent thrombosis and by lowering the risk of adverse events consequent to plaque rupture at sites remote from the stented location.</p><p>The rationale for the use of DAPT, as opposed to antiplatelet monotherapy, is derived from the known tendency of circulating blood to clot in the presence of many metals. This period of risk decreases after the metal portion of the stent is endothelialized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-antiplatelet-therapy-after-coronary-artery-stenting-in-stable-patients/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].

For example, the efficacy of combined antiplatelet therapy was demonstrated in the STARS trial in which 1653 patients were randomly assigned to aspirin alone or in combination with warfarin or ticlopidine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-antiplatelet-therapy-after-coronary-artery-stenting-in-stable-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The primary end point included all clinical events reflecting stent thrombosis within 30 days: death, revascularization of the target lesion, angiographically documented thrombosis, or MI. The rate of the primary end point was significantly lower with aspirin plus ticlopidine than with aspirin plus warfarin or aspirin alone (0.5 versus 2.7 or 3.6 percent, respectively). After one randomized trial demonstrated similar efficacy between ticlopidine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> but a better side effect profile with the latter, the use of ticlopidine declined dramatically; it is now rarely used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-antiplatelet-therapy-after-coronary-artery-stenting-in-stable-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

However, we believe the rationale for DAPT (as opposed to antiplatelet monotherapy) after DES implantation is strong based on biologic plausibility, evidence of benefit in patients with BMS, and observations of adverse outcomes, including stent thrombosis, when DAPT is discontinued during the period of time when incomplete endothelialization is possible or probable.

Rates of stent thrombosis are highest shortly after stent placement and remain significantly high until endothelialization has occurred. </p><p>After 6 to 12 months, we re-evaluate the patient. For patients who have not had clinically significant bleeding and who continue to be at low risk for bleeding, we continue DAPT for at least an additional 18 months.

However, we prescribe DAPT for less than one year if a bleeding event occurs or the bleeding risk is very high.</p><p>The consistent observation of a risk for stent thrombosis for as long as one year (and longer) after placement of a DES led to an early recommendation for at least one year of DAPT.

PEGASUS-TIMI 54 randomly assigned 21,162 patients with an MI one to three years earlier (median time 1.7 years) to one of two doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticagrelor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticagrelor</a> (90 or 60 mg twice daily) or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-antiplatelet-therapy-after-coronary-artery-stenting-in-stable-patients/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The rate of the primary safety end point of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major bleeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71353\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71353 \">table 2</a>) was higher in the ticagrelor 90 and 60 mg groups (2.6, 2.3, and 1.06 percent, respectively; p&lt;0.001 for each dose versus placebo) but there was no difference in the rates of fatal and nonfatal intracranial hemorrhage (0.63, 0.71, and 0.60 percent, respectively). Importantly, there was no difference in the rate of death from any cause (5.15, 4.69, and 5.15 percent, respectively; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.76-1.04) and a trend toward a lower rate of cardiovascular death. In addition, ticagrelor lowered the risk of any stroke at the lower dose. An observational study that included 33,145 stable patients with previous MI showed a 22 percent (p&lt;0.001) decrease in the rate of major cardiovascular events, a 15 percent (p = 0.03) decrease in cardiovascular death, a 30 percent (p = 0.003) decrease in MI, a 19 percent decrease in stroke (p = 0.02), and a 50 percent (p = 0.02) in stent thrombosis, in favor of extended DAPT versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-antiplatelet-therapy-after-coronary-artery-stenting-in-stable-patients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

The DAPT trial provided evidence to suggest that the benefit for prolonged DAPT is largely independent of stent type. (See <a href=\"#H207533407\" class=\"local\">'Drug-eluting stents'</a> above.)</p><p>Nevertheless, it is recognized that most use of BMS currently is in patients for whom prolonged DAPT is higher risk. In these cases, including high bleeding risk or if a bleeding event occurs, or if the patient needs to undergo noncardiac surgery before one year, we consider limiting therapy to as short as one month. This is based on the fact that the risk of stent thrombosis with BMS is greatest in the first 14 to 30 days, perhaps because the majority of the process of endothelialization has occurred. The best evidence regarding the duration of DAPT for more than 30 days in patients who receive BMS comes from the CREDO trial, in which 2116 patients were randomly assigned to a 300 mg loading dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> or placebo prior to PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-antiplatelet-therapy-after-coronary-artery-stenting-in-stable-patients/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. All patients received clopidogrel 75 mg daily through day 28. From day 29 through 12 months, patients in the initial clopidogrel group received clopidogrel 75 mg daily and those in the control group received placebo. All patients received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> throughout the study. At one year, the risk of the composite primary outcome of death, MI, or stroke was significantly lower with continuation of clopidogrel (8.5 versus 11.5 percent; relative risk reduction 26.9, 95% CI 2.9-44.4). Indirect support for the use of DAPT for one year comes from the PCI-CURE trial of patients with acute coronary syndromes who underwent stenting with BMS. After one month of clopidogrel plus aspirin, patients were randomly assigned to aspirin plus clopidogrel or aspirin plus placebo for a mean of nine months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-antiplatelet-therapy-after-coronary-artery-stenting-in-stable-patients/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Of these, age &ge;75 years was the most important determinant of a worse outcome with longer therapy. </p><p>Comparing high and low score groups, continued thienopyridine therapy compared with placebo was associated with a larger decrease in ischemic events (2.7 versus 5.7 percent; risk difference [RD] -3 percent, 95% CI -4.1 to -2 percent and 1.7 versus 2.3 percent; RD -0.7 percent, 95% CI -1.4 to 0.09 percent, respectively).

Derivation cohort models predicting ischemia and bleeding had modest accuracy with c statistics of 0.70 and 0.68, respectively. In a validation cohort (n = 8136), the c statistics for ischemia and bleeding were 0.64 and 0.64.</p><p>At a lower DAPT score, there is a greater increase in bleeding and smaller reduction in ischemia. At a higher score, there is a greater reduction in ischemia and smaller increase in bleeding. The DAPT investigators concluded that patients with a score &lt;2 have greater harm than good from continued therapy beyond 12 months, while those with a score of 2 or more derive benefit from treatment for an additional 18 months.

This should include a discussion in reasonable detail with the patient and relevant caregivers of the pros and cons of DES versus bare metal stents (BMS) and the likelihood of compliance with recommendations for DAPT for a minimum of 6 to 12 months, including issues of <span class=\"nowrap\">cost/insurance</span> coverage, assessment of the likelihood of noncardiac surgery in the next 12 months, and the consequences of premature cessation of therapy. BMS are preferred when compliance with DAPT is uncertain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Office-based practitioners, such as primary care clinicians or dentists, need to be properly educated about the importance of not discontinuing antiplatelet therapy unless absolutely necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Placement of BMS should be considered in patients in whom one or more risk factors for bleeding, particularly from the upper gastrointestinal tract, are present. In the event of major bleeding in a noncompressible area that begins in a patient on platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker therapy, the risks of platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker cessation must be weighed against the risk of prolonged bleeding. Consideration should be given to restarting platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker after bleeding has stopped or is controlled and to strategies to decrease the likelihood of bleeding.
