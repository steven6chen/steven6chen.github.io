Physiologic reflux episodes typically occur postprandially, are short-lived, asymptomatic, and rarely occur during sleep. Pathologic reflux is associated with symptoms or mucosal injury and often occurs nocturnally. In general, the term gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is applied to patients with symptoms suggestive of reflux or complications thereof, but not necessarily with, esophageal inflammation. Reflux esophagitis describes a subset of patients with GERD who have endoscopic evidence of esophageal inflammation.</p><p>The pathophysiology of GERD will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2000612361\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) reflects an imbalance between injurious or symptom-eliciting factors (reflux events, acidity of refluxate, esophageal hypersensitivity) and defensive factors (esophageal acid clearance, mucosal integrity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The extent of symptoms and of mucosal injury is proportional to the frequency of reflux events, the duration of mucosal acidification, and the caustic potency of refluxed fluid.</p><p>Esophagitis results from cytokine-triggered inflammation rather than a direct chemical effect of prolonged exposure to acid, pepsin, and bile on the esophageal epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. This is substantiated by the observation that histopathological events in the development of esophagitis (lymphocytic inflammation, dilated intercellular spaces) occur deep in the epithelium, not at the luminal surface, and that regenerative changes (basal cell hyperplasia, papillary elongation) are initiated prior to the development of surface necrosis that was formerly hypothesized as the stimulus for those changes. Cytokine-triggered inflammation may also cause alterations in esophageal sensitivity in the absence of esophagitis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastroesophageal junction incompetence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antireflux barrier at the gastroesophageal junction is anatomically and physiologically complex and vulnerable to several potential mechanisms of reflux. The three dominant pathophysiologic mechanisms causing esophagogastric junction (EGJ) incompetence are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter (LES)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anatomic disruption of the gastroesophageal junction, often associated with a hiatal hernia</p><p/><p>Although examples of each have been documented in mechanistic studies, their relative importance continues to be debated. The evolving concept is that the dominant mechanism varies as a function of disease severity with TLESRs predominating with mild disease, and mechanisms associated with a hiatus hernia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a weak sphincter predominating with more severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient lower TLESR is part of the physiological mechanism of belching. TLESR is an active, vagally mediated reflex allowing air to escape from the stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. A primary determinant of reflux disease is an increased proportion of TLESRs that are associated with acid reflux rather than gas venting alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. </p><p>TLESR involves not only LES relaxation, but also crural diaphragmatic inhibition, esophageal shortening by contraction of its longitudinal muscle, and contraction of the costal diaphragm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. There are several major differences between TLESR and swallow-induced LES relaxation: TLESRs occur without an associated pharyngeal contraction, are unaccompanied by esophageal peristalsis, and persist for longer periods (&gt;10 seconds) as compared with swallow-induced LES relaxations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The frequency of TLESRs is increased by distension of the stomach or by assuming an upright posture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Acid reflux has been observed with as many as 93 percent or as few as 9 percent of TLESRs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>]. Acid reflux with tLESRs can result from increased compliance of the EGJ as a consequence of weakening or dilatation of the diaphragmatic hiatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Increased compliance leads to an increased luminal cross-sectional area during opening that in turn results in an increased volume of reflux and a reduced ability to limit refluxate to gas. TLESRs can be inhibited by gamma aminobutyric acid receptor type B agonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-acid-reflux-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H5204500\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-acid reflux: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Reflux inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only a minority of individuals with GERD have a grossly hypotensive LES (&lt;10 mmHg) when determined during fasting measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Factors that can reduce LES pressure include gastric distension, cholecystokinin, smoking, and specific foods and medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H276680068\" class=\"local\">'Diet and medications'</a> below.)</p><p>Gastroesophageal reflux can occur with diminished LES pressure either by strain-induced reflux or free reflux:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strain-induced reflux occurs when a hypotensive LES is overcome and &quot;blown open&quot; by an abrupt increase of intra-abdominal pressure. Manometric data suggest that strain-induced reflux is relatively unusual unless the LES pressure is less than 4 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, these studies were somewhat limited by the required instrumentation and may not be entirely reflective of normal ambulatory circumstances.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During free reflux, a fall in intraesophageal pH occurs without identifiable change in either intragastric or LES pressure. Free reflux is observed only when LES pressure is within 0 to 4 mmHg of intragastric pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2949949686\"><span class=\"h3\">Anatomic disruption of the gastroesophageal junction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laxity in the LES-crural diaphragm attachment, reduced LES-crural diaphragm synergy, increased EGJ distensibility, and increased intra-abdominal pressure can result in mechanical impairment of the EGJ. Patients with hiatus hernia also have progressive disruption of the diaphragmatic sphincter. (See <a href=\"#H3449333807\" class=\"local\">'Hiatus hernia'</a> below.)</p><p>Physiologically, both the diaphragm and the LES contribute to gastroesophageal sphincter competence and EGJ pressure. Recordings of LES pressure usually exhibit inspiratory increases as a result of contraction of the diaphragmatic crus that encircles the LES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Observations of the antireflux mechanism during maneuvers such as leg raising and abdominal compression suggest a &quot;pinchcock&quot; effect of crural contraction that augments the antireflux barrier. The susceptibility to reflux under circumstances of abrupt increases of intraabdominal pressure (eg, during bending or coughing) depends upon both the instantaneous LES pressure and the diaphragmatic sphincter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H250939534\"><span class=\"h2\">Characteristics of the refluxate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reflux esophagitis is not usually related to increased gastric acid secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The intragastric pH and the amount of time the refluxate is in contact with the mucosa are important determinants of the extent of esophageal mucosal injury. The degree of mucosal damage is more significant if the refluxate pH is less than two <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if pepsin is present in the refluxate. Pepsin, bile acids, trypsin, and food hyperosmolality increase the susceptibility of the esophageal mucosa to acid injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. At pH 2, pepsin disrupts the histologic integrity of the mucosal barrier, increases hydrogen ion permeability, and causes hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Bile acids have been implicated in the development of esophagitis primarily in patients with increased duodenogastric reflux following gastric surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Impaired esophageal acid clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following reflux, esophageal acid clearance begins with emptying the refluxed fluid from the esophagus by peristalsis and is completed by titration of the residual acid with swallowed saliva (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72899\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72899 \">figure 1</a>). Prolongation of esophageal acid clearance time (when the esophageal pH &lt;4) has been observed in approximately one half of patients with esophagitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The two major causes of this problem are impaired esophageal emptying and impaired salivary function. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1131219054\"><span class=\"h3\">Impaired esophageal emptying</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The process of normal acid clearance involves peristalsis as well as the swallowing of salivary bicarbonate. Peristalsis clears gastric fluid from the esophagus, whereas the swallowing of saliva (pH of 7.8 to 8.0) neutralizes any remaining acid. Both primary and secondary peristalsis are essential mechanisms of esophageal clearance. Abnormal acid clearance improves with an erect posture, suggesting that gravity can compensate for impaired fluid emptying.</p><p>Two mechanisms of impaired esophageal emptying have been identified:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ineffective esophageal motility</strong> &ndash; Ineffective esophageal motility can be manifest as either failed or hypotensive (&lt;30 mmHg or distal contractile integral &lt;450 mmHg&#8729;cm&#8729;s) peristaltic contractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Ineffective esophageal motility becomes more common with increasing severity of esophagitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Whether ineffective esophageal motility associated with peptic esophagitis is reversible is uncertain. It is likely that acute dysfunction associated with active esophagitis is partially reversible, while chronic dysfunction associated with stricturing or extensive fibrosis is not.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Re-reflux</strong> &ndash; Re-reflux or retrograde flow associated with hiatal hernias also impairs esophageal emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Re-reflux from the hernia during swallowing occurs only with nonreducing hernias that are evident between swallows and during peristalsis-induced esophageal shortening. In one report, for example, re-reflux was seen with almost 50 percent of test swallows in patients with nonreducing hernias, impairing both esophageal emptying and esophageal acid clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The potential for re-reflux may be aggravated by the presence of an acid pocket in the most proximal gastric cardia that escapes the buffering effects of food and remains highly acidic during the postprandial period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The net result is much greater acid exposure just above the squamocolumnar junction compared to 5 cm proximal to it, likely explaining the propensity of the distal esophagus to develop mucosal erosions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Diminished salivary function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reduced salivation or diminished salivary neutralizing capacity also prolongs acid clearance. Approximately 7 ml of saliva will neutralize 1 ml of 0.1 N HCl, with 50 percent of the neutralizing capacity being attributable to salivary bicarbonate. The normal rate of salivation is about 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ml/min;</span> maneuvers that increase salivation (eg, oral lozenges or gum chewing) will hasten acid clearance. Diminished salivation during sleep, for example, explains why reflux events during sleep or immediately prior to going to sleep are associated with markedly prolonged acid clearance times. Cigarette smokers have prolonged esophageal acid clearance times due to hyposalivation. In one study, smokers without symptoms of reflux disease were found to have acid clearance times 50 percent longer than those of nonsmokers; furthermore, the salivary titratable base content of the smokers was only 60 percent of the age-matched nonsmokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Chronic xerostomia is associated with prolonged esophageal acid exposure and esophagitis in a subset of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2737493066\"><span class=\"h2\">Impaired defense against epithelial injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Age and nutritional status influence the ability of the mucosa to withstand injury. Esophageal mucosa possesses morphologic and physiologic defenses against reflux injury at the epithelial and post-epithelial levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. These mechanisms include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epithelial tight junctions</strong> &ndash; The main defense against reflux injury is the epithelial barrier itself. The esophageal mucosa is a relatively &quot;tight&quot; epithelium, resistant to ionic movements at the intercellular as well as the cellular level because of the tight junctions and the lipid-rich matrix in the intercellular space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This mucosa can retard hydrogen ion penetration in the face of ion gradients of greater than 5 pH units.<br/></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hydrogen ion extrusion</strong> &ndash; Two pH-activated acid extruding processes are located on esophageal membranes: a Na<sup>+</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/H<sup>+</sup></span> exchanger; and a sodium dependent Cl<sup>-</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/HCO3<sup>-</sup></span> exchanger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Once extruded, the hydrogen ions are buffered by extracellular bicarbonate in equilibrium with the blood. Thus, blood flow is the main post-epithelial defense, interacting with epithelial factors to protect against acid injury. Blood flow increases in response to luminal acid, delivering more bicarbonate to the intercellular space as well as providing nutrients for metabolic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].<br/></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3887818288\"><span class=\"h2\">Esophageal hypersensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased mucosal sensitivity to acid can also contribute to symptoms of heartburn. The cause of heartburn in patients with normal esophageal acid exposure is uncertain, but may be related to enhanced sensory perception of physiological reflux (visceral hyperalgesia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2962982752\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER ETIOLOGIC FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors contribute to development of pathological reflux by mechanical or functional impairment of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3449333807\"><span class=\"h2\">Hiatus hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The severity of reflux esophagitis correlates with the size of hiatus hernia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. There are several mechanisms underlying the development of GERD in patients with a hiatus hernia. Mechanisms include impairment of the crural diaphragmatic component of the EGJ, low LES pressure, and a reduced threshold for eliciting transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (TLESR) in response to gastric distension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. In patients with a hiatus hernia, the supradiaphragmatic location of the postprandial acid pocket just distal of the squamocolumnar junction also contributes to the number of TLESRs associated with acid reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Hiatal hernias are also associated with prolonged recumbent acid clearance times due to ineffective esophageal motility and re-reflux, both of which impair esophageal emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Gastroesophageal junction incompetence'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3449333807\" class=\"local\">'Hiatus hernia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary determinant of reflux disease is an increased proportion of TLESRs that are associated with reflux of acid rather than gas. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A minority of individuals with GERD have a grossly hypotensive LES (&lt;10 mmHg) when determined during fasting measurements. However, periods of gross LES hypotension may result from gastric distension, smoking and specific foods and medications. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter'</a> above and <a href=\"#H276680068\" class=\"local\">'Diet and medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hiatus hernia is associated with progressive disruption of the diaphragmatic sphincter, resulting in increased susceptibility to reflux with abrupt increases of intra-abdominal pressure. Hiatus hernia is also associated with a reduced threshold for eliciting TLESRs in response to gastric distension and malfunction of the gastroesophageal barrier during periods of low LES pressure. (See <a href=\"#H2949949686\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic disruption of the gastroesophageal junction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3449333807\" class=\"local\">'Hiatus hernia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Esophageal acid clearance is accomplished with emptying the refluxed fluid from the esophagus by peristalsis and the titration of the residual acid by swallowed saliva. Reduced salivation or diminished salivary neutralizing capacity prolong acid clearance. In patients with hiatus hernia, esophageal acid clearance may be impaired due to ineffective esophageal motility and re-reflux from the hernia. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Impaired esophageal acid clearance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heartburn in patients with normal esophageal acid exposure may be related to heightened esophageal sensitivity (also called visceral hyperalgesia). (See <a href=\"#H3887818288\" class=\"local\">'Esophageal hypersensitivity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Richter JE.
