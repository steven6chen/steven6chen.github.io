This is the most common form of hydrocephalus in children and is almost always associated with increased intracranial pressure (ICP). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocephalus-in-children-physiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydrocephalus in children: Physiology, pathogenesis, and etiology&quot;, section on 'Obstruction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Communicating hydrocephalus</strong> &ndash; Communicating hydrocephalus refers to CSF accumulation due to impaired absorption in the subarachnoid spaces. Rarely, CSF accumulates because of excessive production. Communicating hydrocephalus is also typically associated with increased ICP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocephalus-in-children-physiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydrocephalus in children: Physiology, pathogenesis, and etiology&quot;, section on 'Impaired absorption'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocephalus-in-children-physiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydrocephalus in children: Physiology, pathogenesis, and etiology&quot;, section on 'Excessive production'</a>.)</p><p/><p>There is some overlap in these categories. Many causes of hydrocephalus have both obstructive and absorptive components (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82965\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82965 \">table 1</a>), and the absorptive component of the hydrocephalus may change over time.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Normal pressure hydrocephalus</strong> &ndash; In normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), the cerebral ventricles are pathologically enlarged, but the ICP is not elevated. NPH is most often seen in adults over the age of 60 years. NPH is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-pressure-hydrocephalus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal pressure hydrocephalus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ventriculomegaly</strong> &ndash; Ventriculomegaly is a general term used to describe enlargement of the ventricles as seen on neuroimaging. Ventriculomegaly is a common finding in all forms of hydrocephalus. It is also seen in other conditions that are not associated with hydrocephalus (eg, brain atrophy).</p><p/><p>The forms of hydrocephalus described above are distinct from two radiographic findings that include the same word:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>&quot;Hydrocephalus ex-vacuo&quot;</strong> &ndash; This term refers to enlargement of the CSF spaces caused by reduced volume of brain tissue due to atrophy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61731\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61731 \">image 1</a>) or malformation. It is not accompanied by increased ICP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>&quot;Benign external hydrocephalus&quot;</strong> &ndash; Benign external hydrocephalus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111489\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111489 \">image 2</a>) (also called &quot;benign enlargement of the subarachnoid space&quot; or &quot;benign extra-axial fluid of infancy&quot;) is a relatively common cause of macrocephaly in infancy and frequently occurs in other family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. As the name implies, the condition is self-limited and affected infants usually do not require any intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=macrocephaly-in-infants-and-children-etiology-and-evaluation#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Macrocephaly in infants and children: Etiology and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Benign enlargement of the subarachnoid space'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H755626470\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3362302304\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Timely referral to a pediatric neurosurgeon is important to ensure appropriate management of children with hydrocephalus. In addition, referral to a pediatric neurologist is often warranted, particularly if there are associated conditions such as seizures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> developmental delays.</p><p>Most cases of hydrocephalus are progressive, meaning that neurological deterioration will occur if the hydrocephalus is not effectively and continuously treated. For most patients, the most effective treatment is surgical drainage, using a shunt or third ventriculostomy. Rare exceptions include cases of hydrocephalus caused by a vein of Galen malformation, embolization of the malformation may be more appropriate than surgical drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Rarely, hydrocephalus is not progressive because alternate pathways of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption develop or because normal mechanisms for CSF handling become re-established. This is known as &quot;arrested hydrocephalus.&quot; In this case, shunting is unnecessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1040940676\"><span class=\"h2\">Management approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The need for and timing of surgical intervention in patients with hydrocephalus is determined by the severity of symptoms and the neuroimaging findings:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3149466940\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute rapidly progressive hydrocephalus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with acute rapidly progressive hydrocephalus require urgent surgical intervention, typically with a CSF shunt or endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV). Temporizing measures may be needed for patients with a life-threatening presentation (eg, signs of herniation) and those who are too unstable to undergo surgery. In these circumstances, management often consists of placement of a temporary external ventricular drain (EVD). Diuretic therapy is a less effective option. Serial lumbar punctures are <strong>not</strong> recommended. If the hydrocephalus is due to a structural cause such as a resectable brain tumor, the appropriate intervention consists of removal of the tumor, often with intraoperative EVD placement. If the tumor is not resectable, then a CSF shunt or ETV can be performed to address the hydrocephalus. (See <a href=\"#H635770891\" class=\"local\">'CSF diversion procedures'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ventriculostomy</strong> &ndash; In cases of rapidly progressive hydrocephalus, a temporary EVD may be needed until a permanent shunt can be placed or until the hydrocephalus resolves spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. EVD placement can be lifesaving in this setting. An EVD is a small catheter inserted through the skull usually into the lateral ventricle, which is typically connected to a closed collecting device to allow for drainage of CSF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F56391\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56391 \">figure 1</a>). The EVD can also be connected to a transducer to measure ICP. The major complications associated with EVD are catheter occlusion and infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diuretics</strong> &ndash; The diuretics <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetazolamide</a> decrease CSF production. They have been used for short periods in slowly progressive hydrocephalus in patients too unstable for surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In newborn infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus, treatment with diuretics is generally not effective and is associated with complications. This issue is discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=germinal-matrix-hemorrhage-and-intraventricular-hemorrhage-gmh-ivh-in-the-newborn-prevention-management-and-complications#H17328838\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Germinal matrix hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH) in the newborn: Prevention, management, and complications&quot;, section on 'No effective preventative measures'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Serial lumbar punctures</strong> &ndash; In preterm infants with post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, repeated lumbar punctures are sometimes used as a temporizing measure prior to placement of a more definitive CSF diverting device. However, the routine use of serial LPs as a preventive measure in neonates with intraventricular hemorrhage does not appear to be effective is <strong>not</strong> recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This issue is discussed in greater detail separately.

(See <a href=\"#H635770891\" class=\"local\">'CSF diversion procedures'</a> below and <a href=\"#H891153344\" class=\"local\">'Choice of procedure'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39177165\"><span class=\"h3\">Asymptomatic and low-risk patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asymptomatic patients who lack findings suggestive of elevated ICP (eg, papilledema, bulging fontanel), are achieving expected developmental milestones, and do not have severe ventriculomegaly or obvious obstruction of the CSF pathway on neuroimaging can be managed with watchful waiting. Young infants are followed with serial head measurements, monthly or bi-monthly head ultrasounds, and assessment of gross motor skills. Ultrasound is generally preferred for this monitoring because it is time-efficient, inexpensive, and doesn't require sedation. If there is ongoing clinical concern after the anterior fontanelle closes, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred modality for follow-up neuroimaging. Limited imaging with ultra-fast MRI can also be used as an alternative to ultrasonography in young infants. If signs or symptoms of increased ICP develop <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> there is progression of ventriculomegaly on imaging, surgical intervention is generally warranted. (See <a href=\"#H635770891\" class=\"local\">'CSF diversion procedures'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H635770891\"><span class=\"h2\">CSF diversion procedures</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H891153344\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CSF shunts have long been the standard treatment for hydrocephalus in children (see <a href=\"#H2687704701\" class=\"local\">'CSF Shunt'</a> below). ETV is an alternative approach that has several advantages over CSF shunting in that it is relatively low-cost, durable, and potentially avoids the long-term complications that frequently occur with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts (ie, infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> malfunction). However, ETV is not effective in all patients. As discussed below, the success of ETV depends upon the age of the patient, the cause of hydrocephalus, and upon previous complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H548807590\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic third ventriculostomy'</a> below.)</p><p>Criteria for selection of patients for ETV versus shunting are not standardized and practice varies considerably. The 2014 evidence-based guidelines of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) concluded that outcomes of the two procedures are generally equivalent and they did not advocate for one approach over the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The ETV success score can help identify patients who are likely to benefit from ETV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111224\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111224 \">table 2</a>). In our practice, we use the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We generally perform ETV for patients with third or fourth ventricular outlet obstruction or with clear aqueductal stenosis and for those with pineal region tumors and tectal tumors, because these respond well to ETV.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We generally perform a CSF shunt procedure rather than ETV in patients with a history of IVH, meningitis, or previous shunting, because the likelihood of success with ETV is low in this setting. However, if patients with these disorders also have acquired aqueductal stenosis, we generally attempt ETV prior to pursuing shunting, because we have had moderate success with this approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We generally do not perform ETV for treatment of obstructive hydrocephalus in infants &lt;3 months old, because the likelihood of success is low (around 25 percent) in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children in whom ETV is unsuccessful (ie, hydrocephalus progresses following ETV), we generally perform a shunting procedure, because repeating the ETV acutely is not likely to be successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2687704701\"><span class=\"h3\">CSF Shunt</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A mechanical shunt system is placed to prevent the excessive accumulation of CSF. The shunt allows CSF to flow from the ventricles into the systemic circulation or to the peritoneum where it is absorbed, bypassing the site of mechanical or functional obstruction to absorption. Shunts consist of the following components (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110669\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110669 \">figure 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ventricular catheter</strong> &ndash; A catheter is placed into one of the lateral ventricles (usually the right). In placing the ventricular catheter, entry from the skull is directed to access the ventricle without penetrating eloquent cortex. Frontal or occipital-parietal entry points are most commonly used with the aim of positioning the tip of the catheter in the frontal horn, away from the choroid plexus. The optimal entry point is unclear. A 2014 systematic review of five studies that evaluated the impact of entry point on shunt survival concluded that the available evidence is insufficient to recommend one entry point (frontal or occipital) over the other. Technical adjuvants such as ventricular endoscopic placement, computer-assisted electromagnetic guidance, or ultrasound guidance are sometimes used to guide placement or the ventricular catheter; however, the available data are insufficient to determine if use of these technologies is associated with reduced complication rates <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> improved shunt function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Valve</strong> &ndash; The catheter is connected to a one-way valve system (usually placed beneath the scalp of the postauricular area) that opens when the pressure in the ventricle exceeds a certain value. The ventricular pressure decreases as fluid drains, resulting in closure of the valve until the pressure increases again. Many different shunt system components are available and they function with a variety of pressure, flow, and siphon control characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The design of these systems has evolved with the aim of reducing failure rates and other complications. Antisiphon devices (either intrinsic in the valve mechanism or as a separate device) have been developed to provide progressive resistance to flow to counteract the siphoning that occurs when negative pressure is exerted with vertical positioning. Programmable valves allow alterations in valve function to be made without a surgical procedure. A 2014 systematic review of 22 studies comparing different shunt components concluded that the available evidence did not demonstrate a clear advantage for any specific shunt component, mechanism, or valve design over another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Distal catheter</strong> &ndash; The distal end of the system is connected to a catheter that is most commonly placed in the peritoneal cavity (VP shunt). Less commonly (eg, if peritoneal placement is not feasible), the distal catheter is inserted in the right atrium of the heart (ventriculoatrial [VA] shunt) or pleural space (ventriculopleural shunt).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3981094519\"><span class=\"h4\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, complications of shunted hydrocephalus are due to malfunction of the shunt. If the shunt malfunctions and if the mechanism causing the hydrocephalus is still active, symptoms of hydrocephalus recur, and a shunt revision or other drainage procedure is required. (See <a href=\"#H1293171877\" class=\"local\">'Shunt malfunction'</a> below.)</p><p>Malfunction may be caused by infection or mechanical failure. Approximately 40 percent of standard shunts malfunction within the first year after placement, and 5 percent per year malfunction in subsequent years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infection</strong> &ndash; Shunt infection is a common complication, occurring in approximately 5 to 15 percent of procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/21,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23,24</a>]. This may lead to ventriculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], may promote the development of loculated compartments of CSF, and may contribute to impaired cognitive outcome and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The risk of shunt infections appears to be higher in newborns compared with older infants and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most shunt infections occur in the first six months after shunt placement. This is an important consideration in deciding when to tap shunts to evaluate a fever, especially when there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of mechanical shunt failure. Increasing abdominal pain associated with peritoneal signs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fever is a common presentation of shunt infection in patients with VP shunts. Abdominal ultrasound may demonstrate pseudocyst. Shunt infection must be considered in a child with a shunt who develops persistent fever. Antibiotics should be started, but this treatment alone is often not effective. In most cases, an infected shunt must be removed, and an external ventricular drain must temporarily be placed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infections of cerebrospinal fluid shunts and other devices&quot;, section on 'Device removal'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infections of cerebrospinal fluid shunts and other devices&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the risk of infection. In two meta-analyses, prophylactic antibiotics in the perioperative period reduced the risk of shunt infection by approximately 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The use of antibiotic-impregnated catheters also appears to lower the risk of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/27,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29</a>]. Whether prophylactic antibiotics are beneficial after the perioperative period remains uncertain. These issues are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infections of cerebrospinal fluid shunts and other devices&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of shunt infections are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infections of cerebrospinal fluid shunts and other devices&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mechanical failure</strong> &ndash; Mechanical shunt failure is another important cause of shunt failure. Like shunt infection, it is most common during the first year after shunt placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The majority of shunt failures result from obstruction at the ventricular catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Fractured tubing is the cause of shunt failure in approximately 15 percent of cases. Other causes include shunt migration (partial or complete) and excessive CSF drainage (overdrainage). Mechanical failure requires prompt recognition and surgical intervention. (See <a href=\"#H1293171877\" class=\"local\">'Shunt malfunction'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Overdrainage</strong> &ndash; Overdrainage can cause functional shunt failure, which causes subnormal ICP (particularly in the upright position) and which is associated with characteristic neurological symptoms such as postural headache and nausea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Overdrainage greatly reduces the size of the ventricles causing the catheter to lie against the ependyma and choroid plexus, and these tissues block the holes in the catheter. Overdrainage can lead to slit-ventricle syndrome, which is characterized by small or slit-like ventricles, coupled with transient episodes of symptoms of raised ICP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Changes in shunt design to address the problem of overdrainage include valves designed to open at different pressures and selected based upon the patient's characteristics; anti-siphoning devices to minimize the siphon effect caused by changes in posture; and valves that regulate by flow rather than by pressure differences.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other complications</strong> &ndash; Other less common complications are related to the end site of CSF drainage. Potential complications in patients with VP shunts include perforation of viscus and intestinal obstruction. Patients with VA shunts may develop thrombosis associated with the atrial catheter, cor pulmonale, or very rarely may develop glomerulonephritis (&quot;shunt nephritis&quot;), which is related to chronic infection.

ETV may be used in the initial treatment of selected cases of obstructive hydrocephalus and as an alternative to shunt revision; it is generally not effective for patients with communicating hydrocephalus (ie, hydrocephalus resulting from impaired CSF absorption). Some experts consider ETV the treatment of choice for aqueductal stenosis, although approximately 20 percent of patients still require shunting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Older age at the time of the procedure (ie, &gt;1 year old) is the strongest predictor of success; other important predictors include noninfectious hydrocephalus etiology (eg, aqueductal stenosis, tectal tumor, myelomeningocele, intraventricular hemorrhage [IVH]), and lack of previous shunt.</p><p>In an analysis of 618 ETV procedures performed at 12 international institutions, the overall success of ETV assessed six months after the procedure was 66 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a follow-up study, the same investigators compared outcomes with ETV and shunting in a cohort of children with newly diagnosed hydrocephalus treated with either ETV (489 patients) or shunt insertion (720 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Among patients with high predicted ETV success (ie, ETV success score &ge;80), cumulative reoperation-free survival at 36 months was greater with ETV compared with shunting (72 percent versus 54 percent). However, among patients with moderate and low ETV success scores, outcomes were similar with the two procedures. For patients with moderate ETV success scores (ie, 50 to 70), reoperation-free survival at 36 months was approximately 50 percent in both groups; and for those with low ETV success scores (ie, &le;40), reoperation-free survival at 36 months was approximately 38 percent in both groups.</p><p>In another multicenter, prospective study involving 336 children who underwent initial ETV and were followed for at least 18 months, 42 percent of patients had documented failure of their ETV requiring repeat hydrocephalus surgery during follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Two-year reoperation-free survival was 58 percent. The majority of failures (83 percent) occurred within six months of surgery and the ETV success score was a strong predictor of success. The cohort represented a selected group of patients; most patients (85 percent) were older than 12 months and most (81 percent) had not undergone prior shunt placement.

Permanent morbidity, including hemiparesis, gaze palsy, memory disorders, altered consciousness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypothalamic dysfunction, occurred in 2.1 percent.

Based on favorable results in studies performed predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>], the combined ETV and CPC procedure was introduced in the United States and Canada beginning in the late 2000s to early 2010s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. Initial reports have been promising; however, further data are needed, particularly regarding the long-term effects of CPC, before ETV with CPC can be recommended as a routine practice.</p><p>In a clinical trial conducted in Uganda, 100 infants with postinfectious hydrocephalus were randomly assigned to undergo ETV with CPC or VP shunt placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were assessed at 12 months after surgery using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) score, which ranges from 1 to 19 and is scaled to a mean of 10&plusmn;3 for the general population. BSID scores were similarly low in both groups (median BSID cognitive score in the ETV-CPC group was 4 versus 2 in the VP shunt group). Rates of treatment failure were also similar (35 versus 24 percent, respectively; hazard ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.3-1.5). Postoperative CSF volume was assessed with neuroimaging and was considerably greater in the ETV-CPC group (410 mL versus 171 mL, respectively). There were no differences in infection rates (4 percent in both groups).</p><p>CPC is technically challenging and requires skill with the flexible endoscope. In order to perform the procedure successfully, the surgeon must access the entire lateral ventricle choroid plexus bilaterally. Inadequate lighting in the ventricle may limit the amount of choroid plexus cauterization, and possibly complicate the procedure. In addition, the choroid plexus is not the only site for CSF production, so even if cauterization is successful, the procedure may not adequately address the hydrocephalus in some cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3460058265\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who undergo surgical treatment for hydrocephalus require long-term follow-up with a neurosurgeon. Following the initial surgical intervention, patients should be seen within two to four weeks, or sooner if concerning symptoms develop. Visits can then be spaced out if the child is stable. Neuroimaging studies are typically obtained postoperatively. Postoperative imaging for children who have undergone endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) should include magnetic resonance cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) CSF flow study to demonstrate flow through the ventriculostomy.

The effectiveness of surgical intervention is assessed using both clinical and radiologic findings. Neuroimaging indicators that are commonly used for this purpose include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction in ventricle size</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amount of CSF over the cerebral hemispheres</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of a flow void in the third ventriculostomy site (for patients who underwent third ventriculostomy)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Degree of periventricular edema</p><p/><p>However, imaging findings do not always correlate with important clinical outcomes such as neurocognitive sequelae.
