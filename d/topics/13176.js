Ring sideroblasts are found in diverse circumstances, which underscores a broad spectrum of causes of sideroblastic anemia, both inherited and acquired (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79712\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79712 \">table 1</a>).

For a number of forms, underlying defects have been established at the molecular level, as illustrated in the diagram (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86551\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86551 \">figure 1</a>). However, approximately one-third of cases do not have an identifiable genetic defect as of yet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-the-sideroblastic-anemias/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The causative defects for these patients are actively being sought in research laboratories.</p><p>The congenital sideroblastic anemias can be subdivided into syndromic and non-syndromic forms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79712\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79712 \">table 1</a>), by their mode of inheritance (X-linked, autosomal recessive, or mitochondrial) or according to red blood cell size (microcytic or normocytic-to-macrocytic) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F108664\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108664 \">table 2</a>).

These variants include numerous mutations that affect the catalytic domain of ALAS2 (and reduce enzymatic function in many but not all cases) or the interaction between ALAS2 and succinyl CoA synthetase; some mutations involve the gene's intron 1 or promoter region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-the-sideroblastic-anemias/abstract/3,4,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,7-9</a>].</p><p><em>ALAS2</em> is located on the X chromosome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-the-sideroblastic-anemias/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].
