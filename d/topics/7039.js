This topic will review the epidemiology, genetics, and pathogenesis of FMF. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of FMF are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of familial Mediterranean fever&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2174216678\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is most prevalent in individuals of Turkish, Armenian, North African, Jewish, and Arab descent. Among Armenians, the carrier rate for FMF is approximately one in seven, with an observed disease rate of roughly 1 in 500 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] &#160; Among the Jewish population in Israel, the carrier rate varies from one in eight in those of Ashkenazi origin, to one in six in those of North African origin, to one in four in those of Iraqi origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>However, FMF is not restricted to these ethnic groups. It has also been reported at a lower prevalence in many other populations such as in Greece, Italy, and even Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In the United States, FMF is frequently encountered in Ashkenazi Jews and immigrants from the Middle East and Armenia. In Germany, most FMF patients are of Turkish origin. In France, there is a relatively large FMF population that originated in North Africa. In the Balkans, the number of FMF patients and the rate of <em>MEFV</em> mutations carriage is decreasing as the country is farther from Turkey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Similarly, the prevalence of FMF is highest in southern Italy and decreases gradually toward the northern area. It is hypothesized that the origin of FMF was more than 3000 years ago in Mesopotamia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. From there, the disease was spread to Armenia and Turkey in the Ancient World. In the modern world, the spread of the disease to countries far from the Mediterranean basin can be explained by easy transportation overseas and later by the air.</p><p>FMF shows considerable variability in severity and type of clinical manifestations by region. This variability is probably due to differences in <em>MEFV </em>mutations, additional genetic modifiers, and associated environmental factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H3332003886\" class=\"local\">'Genotype-phenotype correlation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4190925517\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1959752760\"><span class=\"h2\">MEFV gene mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is usually considered an autosomal recessive disease, and affected individuals have biallelic pathogenic mutations in the <em>MEFV</em> gene located on the short arm of chromosome 16 (16 pm 13.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Five founder mutations, V726A, M694V, M694I, M680I, and E148Q, account for approximately 75 percent of FMF chromosomes from typical cases in Armenians, Arabs, Jews, and Turks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Among them, M694V is the most frequent mutation in all four populations, with a prevalence ranging from 20 to 65 percent. However, approximately 10 to 20 percent of individuals who meet diagnostic criteria for FMF have no <em>MEFV</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Phenotypic expression of FMF has been reported in a significant subset of patients who carry only one <em>MEFV</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The fact that there are FMF patients who carry only a single mutation raises the question of whether the disease is also transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>]. Some reports describe a dominant trait among patients with specific mutations such as M694VDel, a deletion mutation, or H478Y and T577N missense mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. The deletion mutation may cause a serious defect in the encoded pyrin protein, leading to full expression of FMF. However, there is no clear explanation for the presence of FMF in those individuals carrying the other single missense mutations. Since more than 95 percent of the carriers of a single <em>MEFV</em> mutation (heterozygotes) are asymptomatic, it is hypothesized that there are additional genetic modifiers that influence the phenotypic expression of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In a study using a statistical approach to estimate the contribution of heterozygosity to disease prevalence, a genotype comparison in siblings from 63 familial forms and a genotype study in 557 patients from four Mediterranean populations were performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These studies demonstrated that heterozygosity is not responsible for classical Mendelian FMF per se but constitutes a risk factor to develop FMF, with the risk six- to eightfold higher compared with non-carriers of <em>MEFV</em> mutation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3332003886\"><span class=\"h2\">Genotype-phenotype correlation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although mutations are found throughout the entire <em>MEFV</em> gene in patient with FMF, the mutations with the most severe forms of disease are clustered in exon 10, which encodes a motif known as the B30.<span class=\"nowrap\">2/SPRY</span> domain at the C terminus of the protein. Genetic variants found in exons 2 (eg, E148Q) and 3 are usually associated with less severe clinical presentations of FMF or even just mild nonspecific inflammatory manifestations. In Japan, where most mutations are in exon 2-4, FMF tends to be mild and easily controlled with low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Individuals with one or no pathogenic <em>MEFV </em>mutations usually tend to have milder disease as compared with those with biallelic pathogenic variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>M694V homozygotes have a severe phenotype and are more likely to have arthritis, renal amyloidosis, erysipelas-like skin lesions, high fever, splenomegaly, and more frequent attacks as compared with individuals with other<em> MEFV</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, patients with these mutations require higher doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> to prevent attacks as compared with patients with other genotypes. The M694V mutation affects the majority of North African Jews with FMF; these patients are known to have more severe attacks and in the pre-colchicine era they had a high frequency of amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Ashkenazi Jews, Druze, and Armenians who have a low frequency of the M694V mutation tend to have milder versions of FMF with a low prevalence of amyloidosis. Among Arab patients, homozygosity for the M694V allele results in more severe disease as compared with M694I homozygotes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>It is unclear if the E148Q mutation is a polymorphism or a disease-causing sequence alteration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. E148Q mutation has reduced penetrance and E148Q homozygotes are asymptomatic or may have a mild disease; amyloidosis is rare in individuals with these mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2899008279\"><span class=\"h2\">Other genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incomplete penetrance and the varying expression of FMF suggest the presence of other, possibly genetic factors that could influence the expression of illness. Evidence that another gene may modulate the clinical expression of the <em>MEFV</em> gene is the segregation of different alleles of the major histocompatibility class I chain-related gene A (MICA) among FMF patients with different clinical features. In one study that evaluated 151 affected patients and their family members for the presence of five common MICA alleles, the A-9 allele was strongly associated with early disease onset in M694V homozygotes, while the A-4 allele appeared to have a beneficial effect on the frequency of FMF attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The possibility that another gene tightly linked to MICA, and in linkage disequilibrium with the different MICA alleles, has not been excluded. The mechanism through which MICA, or another closely linked gene, influences the FMF phenotype is unclear.</p><p>Heterogeneity among additional disease-modifying proteins may also contribute to the variable phenotypes among patients with identical <em>MEFV</em> genotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>] &#160; This was illustrated in a study that evaluated the genotype of 137 Armenian patients from 127 families. In this study, the presence of the SAA1 alpha homozygous genotype was associated with a sevenfold increased risk for renal amyloidosis as compared with other SAA1 genotypes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3888668906\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <em>MEFV</em> gene encodes pyrin, a 781 amino acid protein that is expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm in cells of the myeloid lineage (among circulating cells) along with synovial fibroblasts and dendritic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Pyrin has an important role in the innate immune system, which constitutes a primary defense against external pathogens and other noxious agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Its exact role and mechanism of action appears to be in sensing changes in the Rho-GTPases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Rho (Ras [Rat sarcoma] homolog gene family) proteins are important in controlling GTPase activity which in turn are important in the regulation of actin and tubulin dynamics. Actin-tubulin interaction is important in neutrophil motility and chemotaxis. Bacterial toxin (eg, <em>Clostridium difficile</em> toxin) may modify the effect of Rho proteins on GTPases, thereby inhibiting actin-tubulin activity and neutrophil chemotaxis. Pyrin does not directly recognize Rho modification but probably senses an event downstream of Rho modification in the actin cytoskeleton pathway. Pyrin detects pathogen virulence activity, which is different from most mammalian pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that directly recognize microbial products. Cytotoxin TcdB6&ndash;8, a major virulence factor of <em>C. difficile</em> which causes most cases of nosocomial diarrhea, triggers the assembling of Pyrin inflammasome by recruiting apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) peptide and procaspase which is responsible for the inflammatory process fighting this infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This observation explains the role of pyrin in inflammation induced by <em>Clostridium</em> toxin or by other infective agents.</p><p>In patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), the mutations in the <em>MEFV</em> gene lead to the production of pyrin protein which is capable of constructing the inflammasome even in the absence of a known external trigger such as a toxin or an infective agent. This possibility suggests that the mutations in <em>MEFV</em> gene cause gain of function of pyrin protein so that it acts without a known provocation. The outcome of this process is secretion of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-18, and other mediators of inflammation which enhance chemotaxis and neutrophilia, inducing an attack of FMF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].
