Experiments in animal models have demonstrated that a sequence of interrelated events must occur before microbes can establish an infective nidus or vegetation on the endocardium:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial step in the establishment of a vegetation is endocardial injury, followed by focal adherence of platelets and fibrin. Some organisms with high virulence are capable of infecting normal human heart valves, such as <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initially sterile platelet-fibrin nidus becomes secondarily infected by microorganisms circulating in the blood, either from a distant source of focal infection or as a result of transient bacteremia from a mucosal or skin source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-vegetation-formation-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is likely that the pathogenesis of vegetation formation varies depending on the infecting organism. In most instances, colonization of the platelet-fibrin aggregate is an initial event. Subsequent microbial growth results in further activation of the coagulation system via the extrinsic clotting pathway, adherent monocytes release a variety of cytokines, and activated endothelial cells continue to express further local deposition of fibronectin. These processes culminate in a macroscopic excrescence or vegetation. Bacterial growth occurs within cells and within the matrix of fibronectin inside vegetations, making it difficult for host immune responses to control or eradicate the ongoing infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91877\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91877 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91876\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91876 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-vegetation-formation-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacterial-platelet and neutrophil-platelet interactions appear to be important in the development and enlargement of a vegetation. For example, vegetations may contain layers of neutrophil extracellular traps that interconnect bacteria-platelet aggregates within vegetations. These extracellular traps may serve as &quot;scaffolds,&quot; or meshes, that both further entrap bacteria-platelet aggregates and enhance the growth of vegetations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-vegetation-formation-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Some pathogens such as streptococci may interact with platelets to form biofilms with multilayer architecture that are embedded within mats or tiny nidi within vegetations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-vegetation-formation-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>The significance of vegetation size is discussed further separately.

The surface generally consists of fibrin and varying numbers of leukocytes. Clumps of bacteria, histiocytes, and monocytes are generally observed deep within the vegetation; giant cells containing phagocytosed bacteria may also be seen. Extremely high concentrations of bacteria (eg, 10<sup>9</sup> to 10<sup>11</sup> colony forming <span class=\"nowrap\">units/gram</span> of tissue) may accumulate deep within vegetations; some of these organisms exist in a state of reduced metabolic activity. Vegetations are avascular structures; following therapy and during the healing process, capillaries and fibroblasts appear.</p><p>In one study comparing vegetation histology of infected prosthetic valves and sterile (but dysfunctional) native valves, the former demonstrated microorganisms and inflammatory infiltrates containing neutrophils, while the latter demonstrated inflammatory adherent thrombi containing mostly lymphocytes and macrophages; microorganisms were not present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-vegetation-formation-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H726986\"><span class=\"h3\">Effect of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following treatment of endocarditis, vegetations may disappear or persist. A retrospective histopathology study among 480 patients with endocarditis who underwent valve replacement or repair noted the following findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-vegetation-formation-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Valvular specimens from patients undergoing surgery prior to completion of antimicrobial therapy demonstrated microorganisms by Gram stain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> histologic examination in most cases (81 and 67 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detection of microorganisms does not imply treatment failure in patients undergoing surgery prior to completion of antimicrobial therapy. The only reliable method to determine the efficacy of treatment in such cases is culture of the excised tissue; clearance of dead organisms via lysis or phagocytosis may take months.</p><p/><p>Evaluation of vegetations with polymerase chain reaction may demonstrate the presence of bacterial DNA months to years after completion of appropriate therapy; such findings likely represent persistence of nonviable bacterial debris within the vegetation, although, in some cases, such results may reflect persistence of viable organisms deep within the vegetation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-vegetation-formation-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H726282\"><span class=\"h2\">Host factors</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h3\">Endocardial injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is virtually impossible to induce endocarditis in experimental animals unless the valvular endocardium is first traumatized with a polyethylene catheter inserted into the right or left side of the heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-vegetation-formation-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A corollary to this observation is that animals with prior catheter-induced valvular lesions that are injected with bacteria such as viridans streptococci (which have the inherent ability to adhere to fibrin-platelet matrices on damaged endocardium) predictably develop a vegetation at the site of valve injury within a few days. Similar lesions probably occur naturally in bacteremic humans with congenital or acquired cardiac lesions that induce continuous endocardial trauma via regurgitant flow or high-pressure jets of blood through stenotic lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H726185\"><span class=\"h3\">Vegetation sites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vegetations tend to develop at sites where blood travels from an area of high pressure through a narrow orifice into an area of lower pressure. The explanation for this phenomenon can be deduced from in vitro experiments demonstrating the physics of turbulent flow. As an example, it has been observed that, following injection of nebulized bacteria into an air stream passing through an agar-coated tube, the highest concentration of bacteria is found in the low pressure area immediately distal to the narrowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-vegetation-formation-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The propensity for vegetations to form at specific sites may be correlated with a decrease in lateral pressure downstream from the regurgitant flow, which causes a decrease in the perfusion of the intimal lining at these sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-vegetation-formation-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the setting of preexisting valvular disease, vegetations are usually located on the atrial surface of incompetent atrioventricular valves or the ventricular surface of incompetent semilunar valves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the setting of ventricular septal defect, vegetations tend to develop on the orifice of the defect, on the right ventricular side of the opening, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> secondarily on the tricuspid and pulmonic valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-vegetation-formation-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the setting of aortic insufficiency, vegetations may localize to the chordae tendineae of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the setting of mitral regurgitation, vegetations may develop on the wall of the left atrium, where the regurgitant jet strikes the atrial wall and results in endocardial thickening (MacCallum's patch).</p><p/><p>In addition, presence of mitral annular calcification (a chronic inflammatory and degenerative process) may serve as a nidus for <em>S. aureus</em> vegetations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-vegetation-formation-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H726316\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogen factors</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H726357\"><span class=\"h3\">Source of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bacterial source for endocarditis may be readily discernible (such as a dental abscess, infected skin lesion, or infected vascular catheter) or there may be no clear history of antecedent infection.

Organisms typically associated with endocarditis have the capacity to adhere avidly to valve tissue; these include <em>S. aureus</em>, viridans streptococci, enterococci, and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-vegetation-formation-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Bacterial adherence to a platelet-fibrin nidus involves a complex interaction of microbial cell wall components. The mechanism of adherence is poorly understood and may vary among different organisms.</p><p>In vitro models have provided some data regarding the pathogenesis of adherence:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relative frequency with which different species of bacteria cause endocarditis in humans has been correlated with their ability to cause endocarditis in rabbits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-vegetation-formation-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In this experimental model, the amount of dextran produced by the cell wall of streptococci grown in broth is proportional to the intrinsic ability of various <em>Streptococcus </em>species to cause endocarditis, suggesting the importance of the interaction between dextran and the valvular endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-vegetation-formation-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrinsic binding affinity to fibronectin appears to be a contributing pathogenic factor; in rats, <em>S. aureus</em> mutants with diminished capacity to bind fibronectin had reduced ability to cause endocarditis compared with parent strains with higher fibronectin-binding affinity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-vegetation-formation-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucosyltransferases, proteins made by viridans streptococci, have the ability to convert sucrose into polysaccharides which in turn may act as &quot;modulins&quot; to induce various cytokines that in turn recruit leukocytes to vegetations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-vegetation-formation-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>Other potential mediators of microbial adherence include fibrinogen, laminin, and type 4 collagen. These mediators may be particularly important for specific strains of bacteria that have the propensity to cause endocarditis. As an example, strains of <em>Streptococcus mutans</em> that express certain cell collagen binding proteins have high fibrinogen binding rates in vitro and have a propensity to cause endocarditis in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-vegetation-formation-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H727224\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, the initial step in the establishment of a vegetation is endocardial injury, followed by focal adherence of platelets and fibrin.
