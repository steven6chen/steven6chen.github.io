It is an aggressive NHL in which survival without treatment is measured in months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-the-hematopoietic-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of the hematopoietic neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The initial treatment of DLBCL is dependent upon the extent of disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 1</a>). For treatment purposes, patients with DLBCL are generally classified as having either limited stage disease or advanced stage disease based upon whether or not the tumor can be contained within one irradiation field:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited stage disease (usually Ann Arbor stage I or II) &ndash; Limited stage DLBCL can be contained within one irradiation field. This population accounts for 30 to 40 percent of patients with DLBCL. Limited stage DLBCL is treated primarily with combined modality therapy consisting of abbreviated systemic chemotherapy (three cycles), the recombinant anti-CD20 antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, and involved field radiation therapy. Alternatively, full course (six to eight cycles) systemic chemotherapy plus rituximab without radiation therapy may be used.

Many clinicians treat such patients in a similar fashion to those with advanced stage disease.

General approaches to the diagnostic work-up and staging of NHL are presented separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation, staging, and response assessment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H353921775\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pretreatment evaluation both determines the extent of the disease and provides information about the individual's comorbidities that are likely to have an impact on treatment options. In addition to a history and physical examination, it is our practice to perform the following pretreatment studies in patients with DLBCL:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies include a complete blood count with differential, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), albumin, hepatitis B, and uric acid. All patients with DLBCL should be encouraged to undergo serologic testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-reactivation-associated-with-immunosuppressive-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus reactivation associated with immunosuppressive therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral bone marrow biopsy is suggested for most patients. Although positron emission tomography (PET) has a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting marrow involvement in patients with DLBCL, it may miss low volume, diffuse involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, only pathologic review of a bone marrow biopsy can determine whether such involvement is concordant or discordant, a distinction that has prognostic value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As such, bone marrow biopsy is an important part of the evaluation of the patient without evidence of bone involvement by PET. In contrast, bone marrow biopsy may not necessary if the PET indicates bone or marrow involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation, staging, and response assessment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy'</a>.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar puncture is recommended for all patients with testicular, epidural, or sinus involvement. In addition, lumbar puncture could be considered for patients with breast, ovarian, or concordant bone marrow involvement, a high International Prognostic Index (IPI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70850 \">table 2</a>), or numerous extranodal sites of disease. If lumbar puncture is performed, cerebrospinal fluid should be sent for both cytology and flow cytometry.

This evaluation may not be necessary in young patients without a history of cardiac disease who plan to undergo abbreviated anthracycline-based chemotherapy (ie, three cycles of R-CHOP).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men and women with childbearing potential should receive counseling about the potential effect of treatment on their fertility and options for fertility-preserving measures. Given the urgent need for treatment with DLBCL, options for women are limited, but men can often participate in sperm banking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fertility preservation in patients undergoing gonadotoxic treatment or gonadal resection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Integrated whole body positron emission tomography with computed tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET/CT)</span> is the preferred pretreatment imaging study. DLBCL is considered a typically FDG-avid tumor such that involved areas should show activity on PET scan. A dedicated contrast-enhanced CT scan may be required in addition to the <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> to define the extent of disease in special situations, such as in the setting of lymphadenopathy close to bowel or if there is compression or thrombosis of blood vessels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation, staging, and response assessment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Routine imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H353920938\"><span class=\"h2\">Identify disease subtype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the diagnosis of DLBCL is confirmed, the next step includes an evaluation for those abnormalities that help predict outcome following treatment. Prognosis in DLBCL depends on several variables: host factors (age, performance status, comorbidities), stage, response to therapy, and disease biology. Disease biology is dictated by genetic and molecular events. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma#H14049196\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Molecular genetics'</a>.)</p><p>We suggest that the following tests be performed to assess molecular risk in all newly diagnosed patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Evaluation of cell of origin</strong> (gene expression profile [GEP] analysis, immunohistochemistry algorithms, or Lymph2Cx platform) &ndash; GEP is the gold standard for determining cell of origin, but it requires fresh tissue and is not routinely available in practice. Given their ease of use, immunohistochemistry algorithms (eg, Tally and Hans) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F104767\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104767 \">figure 1</a>) are the most commonly used method; concordance with GEP is approximately 80 percent. While not yet widely available, the Lymph2Cx can be performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and is highly concordant with GEP. When available, Lymph2Cx may replace immunohistochemistry algorithms for cell of origin assignment in DLBCL</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Using this information, an individual case may be subclassified according to the cell of origin as one of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Germinal center B cell (GCB) DLBCL</strong> &ndash; Cases with GCB DLBCL identified by GEP, immunohistochemistry algorithms, or Lymph2Cx without double hit DLBCL. These patients have a relatively good prognosis following standard therapy with R-CHOP. (See <a href=\"#H353922366\" class=\"local\">'Germinal center B cell type DLBCL'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Activated B cell (ABC) DLBCL or non-GCB DLBCL</strong> &ndash; Cases with non-GCB DLBCL identified by GEP, immunohistochemistry algorithms, or Lymph2Cx without double hit DLBCL have high relapse rates and a less favorable prognosis following treatment with R-CHOP. Patients with non-GCB DLBCL should be referred for trials investigating novel therapies. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Evaluation of MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 status</strong> (fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] or immunohistochemistry) &ndash; FISH is preferred in all cases. An acceptable alternative is to perform immunohistochemistry for MYC and BCL2. Cases with MYC overexpression on immunohistochemistry should have further testing for <em>MYC, BCL2, </em>and<em> BCL6</em> gene rearrangements by FISH.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This information is used to determine whether the lymphoma should be classified as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Double hit DLBCL</strong> &ndash; <em>MYC</em> translocation plus gene rearrangement of <em>BCL2, BCL6</em>, or both; double hit genetic events can be found in both GCB and ABC types of DLBCL. Patients with double hit DLBCL are candidates for more aggressive chemotherapy regimens (eg, da-EPOCH-R) given high rates of relapse and poor survival following treatment with standard R-CHOP. (See <a href=\"#H353922394\" class=\"local\">'Double hit or double expressor DLBCL'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Primary large B cell lymphoma of the mediastinum (PMBL) is a distinct clinicopathologic entity that must be distinguished from DLBCL. PMBL is an aggressive tumor arising in the mediastinum from the thymic (medullary) B cell. Patients present with a locally invasive anterior mediastinal mass that frequently extends into local structures, resulting in superior vena cava syndrome, effusions, and symptoms of cough, dyspnea, dysphagia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hoarseness. Management differs from DLBCL. The diagnosis and management of PMBL is discussed separately.

The following populations have a particularly high risk of CNS recurrence, which may justify CNS prophylaxis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and involvement of &gt;1 extranodal site</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four or more of the following risk factors: elevated serum LDH, serum albumin &lt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L,</span> &lt;60 years of age, retroperitoneal lymph node involvement and involvement of &gt;1 extranodal site</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphomatous involvement of certain organs (eg, testes)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concurrent bone marrow involvement</p><p/><p>The decision to administer CNS prophylaxis and the choice of regimen is discussed in more detail separately.

This population accounts for 60 to 70 percent of patients with DLBCL. Without therapy, patients with DLBCL have survival times measured in months. Standard treatment with combination chemotherapy plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> can cure a percentage of patients resulting in survival rates of approximately 70, 60, and 45 percent at 3, 5, and 10 years after diagnosis.</p><p>Advanced stage DLBCL is treated primarily with systemic chemotherapy plus immunotherapy with the recombinant anti-CD20 antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>. The preferred chemotherapy depends in part upon the molecular subtype. While general treatment principles for advanced stage DLBCL apply to most disease presentations and patient populations, involvement of certain organs, particularly when occurring as primary sites of disease, has unique therapeutic implications. In addition, older adults and patients with cardiac disease or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection require special consideration. In addition, there are some special scenarios (eg, testicular lymphoma) in which central nervous system prophylaxis is required. These are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"#H1554322491\" class=\"local\">'Special scenarios'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-prognosis-and-prophylaxis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment, prognosis, and prophylaxis of secondary central nervous system lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H353924411\"><span class=\"h2\">Targeting CD20</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with other B cell lymphomas, DLBCL expresses CD20 on the cell surface. Monoclonal antibodies targeting CD20 are a key component of therapy for B cell lymphomas. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> was the first anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody developed and the only one approved by regulatory agencies for the treatment of DLBCL. The addition of rituximab to combination chemotherapy results in an approximately 10 to 15 percent overall increase in survival beginning at one year from initiation of therapy in patients of all ages with almost no increase in toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>A randomized trial that directly compared CHOP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) chemotherapy plus either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> or the second generation anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obinutuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">obinutuzumab</a>, reported no significant differences in clinical outcomes or toxicities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

A subcutaneous formulation (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-and-hyaluronidase-subcutaneous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab-hyaluronidase</a>) that uses a fixed dose and a shorter administration time is an acceptable alternative for patients who have tolerated at least one full dose of intravenous rituximab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Randomized trials have demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety of the two formulations in patients with follicular lymphoma, DLBCL, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>].</p><p>The following is an overview of the largest prospective, randomized trials that evaluated the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> to CHOP-based therapy in previously untreated patients with DLBCL. Different CHOP regimens with and without rituximab have been evaluated, although practically all administered CHOP every 21 days (CHOP-21).

This preference is based on numerous randomized trials conducted prior to the advent of rituximab-containing regimens, which compared CHOP with many other anthracycline-based regimens. These regimens offered no improvement in remission rate, disease-free survival (DFS), or OS and were associated with increased toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>].</p><p>Subsequent studies have evaluated the efficacy of R-CHOP in different genetic and molecular subtypes of DLBCL and suggest its efficacy differs among these populations. As an example, an analysis of 344 patients with de novo DLBCL (51 percent with advanced stage disease) treated with curative intent with R-CHOP reported the following estimated outcomes at five years according to molecular subtype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Germinal center B cell (GCB) type DLBCL &ndash; Freedom from progression (FFP) 76 percent; progression-free survival (PFS) 73 percent; disease-specific survival (DSS) 82 percent; OS 78 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activated B cell (ABC) type DLBCL &ndash; FFP 51 percent; PFS 48 percent; DSS 61 percent; OS 56 percent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Double expressor DLBCL (MYC expression and BCL2 expression by immunohistochemistry) &ndash; FFP 51 percent; PFS 48 percent; DSS 58 percent; OS 54 percent.</p><p/><p>These results clearly demonstrate that ABC and double protein DLBCL are associated with inferior outcomes after R-CHOP.

Estimated survival rates at four years range from &gt;90 percent for those with low scores to &lt;60 percent for those with high scores. </p><p>The genetic and molecular profile of the tumor can also predict patient outcome following standard therapy.

Initial reports suggest a similarly poor prognosis among those with double protein DLBCL, as defined as cases in which immunohistochemistry identifies co-expression of MYC and BCL2, but gene rearrangements are not present or not evaluated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Germinal center B cell (GCB) type DLBCL has a gene expression profile (GEP) that resembles a normal germinal center B cell and has excellent rates of five-year survival following standard therapy with R-CHOP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activated B cell (ABC) type DLBCL has a GEP that resembles an activated B cell.

It is an aggressive NHL in which survival without treatment is measured in months. Advanced stage refers to disease that cannot be contained within one irradiation field, and accounts for 60 to 70 percent of patients with DLBCL. (See <a href=\"#H735717\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pretreatment evaluation determines the extent of the disease and provides information about the individual's comorbidities that are likely to affect treatment options. In addition to a history and physical examination, it is our practice to perform laboratory studies, unilateral bone marrow biopsy, and imaging in all patients. Certain subsets of patients will require further testing of their cerebrospinal fluid and cardiac function. Fertility counseling should be offered to patients in childbearing years. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A molecular risk assessment should be performed in all cases to help determine prognosis and direct therapy. This includes both an evaluation of MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 status (by immunohistochemistry or fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]) and an evaluation of cell of origin (by gene expression profiling [GEP], immunohistochemistry-based algorithms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F104767\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104767 \">figure 1</a>), or Lymph2Cx platform). Using this information, an individual case may be subclassified as one of the following (see <a href=\"#H353920938\" class=\"local\">'Identify disease subtype'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Germinal center B cell (GCB) DLBCL &ndash; Cases with GCB DLBCL are those identified by GEP, immunohistochemistry algorithms, or Lymph2Cx without <em>MYC</em> and <em>BCL2</em> gene rearrangements. These patients have a relatively good prognosis following standard therapy with R-CHOP. For most patients with advanced stage GCB DLBCL, we recommend treatment with an anthracycline-based combination chemotherapy regimen plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Specifically, we use six cycles of R-CHOP-21 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63586\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63586 \">table 3</a>). There is no role for the routine use of maintenance rituximab or high-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic cell rescue in first complete remission. (See <a href=\"#H353922366\" class=\"local\">'Germinal center B cell type DLBCL'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Activated B cell (ABC) DLBCL or non-GCB DLBCL &ndash; Cases with non-GCB DLBCL identified by GEP, immunohistochemistry algorithms, or Lymph2Cx, without double hit DLBCL, have high relapse rates and a poor prognosis following treatment with R-CHOP. For patients with advanced stage ABC type DLBCL, we encourage enrollment on a clinical trial evaluating the incorporation of novel agents (eg, R-CHOP plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>; R-CHOP plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibrutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibrutinib</a>; R-CHOP plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>). The more intensive R-ACVBP regimen is an acceptable alternative in practices that have access to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vindesine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vindesine</a>. (See <a href=\"#H353922380\" class=\"local\">'Activated B cell type DLBCL'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Double hit DLBCL &ndash; Cases with <em>MYC</em> translocation plus gene rearrangement of <em>BCL2</em>, <em>BCL6</em> (or both) have a poor prognosis with standard therapy. These patients should be encouraged to enroll on a clinical trial. For those treated off study, we suggest six to eight cycles of dose-adjusted EPOCH-R (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F88411\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88411 \">table 4</a>) with a goal of administering two cycles beyond attainment of a complete remission (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H353922394\" class=\"local\">'Double hit or double expressor DLBCL'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Double expressor DLBCL &ndash; There are limited data regarding the treatment of the larger population of patients with double expressor DLBCL (immunohistochemistry identifies co-expression of <em>MYC</em> and <em>BCL2</em>, but gene rearrangements are not present or were not evaluated). Such patients should be encouraged to enroll on a clinical trial or treated with R-CHOP off study. (See <a href=\"#H353922394\" class=\"local\">'Double hit or double expressor DLBCL'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The general treatment principles for limited and advanced stage DLBCL apply to most disease presentations and patient populations. However, there are unique therapeutic implications regarding involvement of certain organs, particularly when occurring as primary sites of disease. In addition, older adults and patients with cardiac disease or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection require special consideration. (See <a href=\"#H1554322491\" class=\"local\">'Special scenarios'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For most older adults (age &gt;60 years) with DLBCL we suggest full-dose therapy rather than lower doses (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Older adults who are unable to tolerate standard doses of R-CHOP-21 may be considered for a reduced-dose CHOP regimen (ie, R-mini-CHOP). (See <a href=\"#H326785256\" class=\"local\">'Older adults'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with disease affecting certain organs (eg, testicular, epidural, or sinus involvement) are at increased risk of developing central nervous system (CNS) disease. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-prognosis-and-prophylaxis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma#H14776632\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment, prognosis, and prophylaxis of secondary central nervous system lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease response is determined using information from positron emission tomography with computed tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET/CT,</span> which should be obtained six to eight weeks after chemotherapy or at least 12 weeks after the completion of radiation therapy), along with post-treatment history, physical exam, and laboratory studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97480\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97480 \">table 8</a>). (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Response evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients are seen at periodic intervals to monitor for treatment complications and assess for possible relapse. The frequency and extent of these visits depends upon the comfort of both the patient and physician.
