The combination of high-level resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>, and aminoglycosides is now very common among hospital-acquired <em>Enterococcus faecium</em> in the United States and has a major impact on therapeutic options. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vancomycin-resistant enterococci: Epidemiology, prevention, and control&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Problems in the treatment of enterococcal infections were noticed as early as the 1950s with the observation that enterococcal endocarditis was not cured nearly as often as streptococcal endocarditis with penicillin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The reason for the poorer response appears to be that penicillin is not as bactericidal against enterococci as it is (or was in the 1950s) against most viridans streptococci. This phenomenon, which has been commonly described as tolerance, is characteristic of many enterococcal strains and, even in those that do not initially display tolerance, can be rapidly elicited by pulsed (intermittent) penicillin exposure. The latter observation led to some support for the use of continuous-infusion penicillin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> in an attempt to avoid eliciting tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS OF RESISTANCE IN ENTEROCOCCI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Until the last few decades, enterococci could be treated with penicillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> with or without an aminoglycoside. Some enterococci have now acquired resistance to these and many other agents as a result of mutations (eg, causing high-level resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a> or to fluoroquinolones) or the acquisition of new gene(s).</p><p>With respect to the acquisition of new genes, enterococci have several different ways of transferring DNA by conjugation (bacterial mating):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One mechanism, involving pheromone-responsive plasmids, causes plasmid transfer between <em>Enterococcus faecalis</em> isolates at a very high frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another mechanism involves other plasmids that can transfer among a broad range of species and genera, although usually at a moderately low frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third mechanism (conjugative transposition) involves transfer of specialized transposons at low frequency but to a very broad range of different kinds of bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Conjugative transposons are relatively nonselective in their host range and are one of the few types of elements known to have crossed the <span class=\"nowrap\">gram-positive/gram-negative</span> barrier in naturally occurring clinical isolates and to then cause resistance in these various hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fourth mechanism involves the transfer of large fragments of chromosomal DNA directly from one cell to the other via conjugation. This has been described with conjugative transposons and, in <em>E. faecalis,</em> with pheromone-responsive plasmids; with the latter, the transfer of chromosomal DNA appears to be dependent upon recombination occurring between homologous sequences present on these plasmids and the chromosome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p>Many of the acquired resistances of enterococci involve antibiotics rarely used to treat enterococcal infections. These include tetracyclines, macrolides, and high levels of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>, and fluoroquinolones. It seems likely that these resistances have emerged among enterococci that were colonizing humans or animals to whom antibiotics were given for other reasons.</p><p>This observation serves as a reminder that the colonizing flora is at least as likely to be influenced by the use of antibiotics as is the infecting organism. Colonizing bacteria may actually be more capable of developing resistance because they coexist with multiple other bacterial species in nonsterile sites like the gastrointestinal tract and therefore have access to their resistance genes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BETA-LACTAM RESISTANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike many streptococci, an important intrinsic property of enterococci is their resistance to many beta-lactam compounds. The greatest degree of resistance is to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aztreonam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aztreonam</a>, which lacks activity against all gram-positive cocci, and the cephalosporins (although new generation cephalosporins, such as ceftobiprole and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftaroline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftaroline</a>, exhibit some activity against <em>E. faecalis</em> but not most <em>E. faecium</em>), followed by the antistaphylococcal penicillins such as methicillin and the carboxypenicillins such as ticarcillin.</p><p>Even with the more active beta-lactams (eg, penicillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin</a>), it takes 10 to 1000 times more drug to inhibit an average <em>Enterococcus</em> than an average <em>Streptococcus</em>. <em>E. faecalis</em>, the more susceptible of the two predominant enterococcal species, is usually inhibited by 1 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> of ampicillin and 2 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> of penicillin; the comparable minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for <em>E. faecium</em> are typically 8 to 32 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>. However, <em>E. faecium</em> strains that are much more highly resistant to ampicillin have emerged in the past several decades.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Ampicillin resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A gene coding for penicillinase was first reported in staphylococci and later found, although very rarely, in enterococci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Most penicillinase-producing enterococci have been <em>E. faecalis</em>, but eight isolates of <em>E. faecium</em> from a polyclonal outbreak in Italy were reported to possess the beta-lactamase gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Relatively little penicillinase is produced by enterococci in comparison with most <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, which can result in a problem of detection for the clinical laboratory. At the standard inoculum used for susceptibility testing, penicillinase-producing enterococci appear no more resistant to penicillin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> than a nonpenicillinase-producing organism; however, these organisms will show resistance at a high inoculum when more enzyme is present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57470\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57470 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>An in vivo effect of penicillinase has been demonstrated in animal models with a better response to penicillins in the presence of beta-lactamase inhibitors. The Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly called the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, or NCCLS) currently recommends that, because of the rarity of penicillinase-positive enterococci, a test for penicillinase need not be performed routinely but can be used in selected cases, such as endocarditis and other serious infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. If recognized, these organisms pose no real therapeutic dilemma since they are susceptible to beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-and-sulbactam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin-sulbactam</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a>, and to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>.</p><p>A more difficult problem is posed by enterococci with high-level resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> due to a nonpenicillinase mechanism, since this resistance is not overcome by adding a beta-lactamase inhibitor. This phenotype is primarily seen in <em>E. faecium</em>. Isolates of this species recovered prior to the mid- to late 1980s, although more resistant to ampicillin than <em>E. faecalis</em>, were usually inhibited by &lt;8 to 32 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> of ampicillin. More recently, a trend toward much higher levels of resistance has been observed among nosocomial isolates, with some strains failing to be inhibited by 256 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> of ampicillin or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The intrinsic resistance of <em>E. faecium</em> appears to be due to the presence of a cell wall synthesis enzyme (encoded by a gene that is part of the core genome) that is relatively resistant to inhibition by penicillin. This low-affinity penicillin-binding protein (PBP) is called PBP5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. There are two versions of PBP5: PBP5-R and PBP5-S. PBP5-R is typically observed in strains of hospital-associated <em>E. faecium</em> with high MICs for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>. PBP5-S is typically found in nonclinical or community-associated strains and has lower MICs for ampicillin. Higher levels of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics appear to involve one or more of the following mechanisms: increased expression of PBP5-R, alterations in the PBP5 protein around the active site, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> utilization of a beta-lactam&ndash;insensitive transpeptidase for cell wall synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p>Enterococci are also intrinsically resistant to cephalosporins with high MIC for the majority of these compounds; lower MICs are seen with newer cephalosporins, such as ceftobiprole and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftaroline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftaroline</a>. Intrinsic resistance to cephalosporins in <em>E. faecalis</em> has been associated with the presence of a putative serine-threonine kinase (designated IreK) and is reciprocally regulated by IreP, a protein phosphatase whose gene is encoded immediately upstream of IreK<em> </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A similar serine-threonine kinase system (designated Stk) has also been involved in cephalosporin resistance in <em>E. faecium</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">AMINOGLYCOSIDE RESISTANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enterococci are intrinsically resistant to low to moderate levels of aminoglycosides. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> is usually 8 to 64 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> and that of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a> is 64 to 512 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>. However, synergism is generally seen with these two compounds when enterococci are exposed to a combination of the aminoglycoside with a cell wall active agent, such as penicillin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>. In this setting, there is usually a marked increase in killing (&gt;100 colony-forming units <span class=\"nowrap\">[CFU]/mL,</span> more killing than with penicillin alone), and a bactericidal effect (defined as &ge;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">CFU/mL</span> or a 99.9 percent decrease from the starting inoculum) is achieved by 24 hours.</p><p>This synergistic effect presumably explains the clinical observation in the 1950s that a combination of penicillin with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a> was much more effective for treatment of enterococcal endocarditis than penicillin alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This regimen subsequently became the standard of care.</p><p>In addition to the usual increased MICs of aminoglycosides for all enterococci, a naturally occurring characteristic of <em>E. faecium</em> is higher MICs of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a> (MICs 64 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> and resistance to synergism with this aminoglycoside. This is due to the presence of an aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme, a tobramycin 6'-acetyltransferase [AAC(6')-Ii], which modifies tobramycin but not <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This enzyme eliminates synergism between cell wall&ndash;active agents and tobramycin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kanamycin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">kanamycin</a>, netilmicin, and sisomicin. Similarly, many enterococci possess the <em>aph(3')-IIIa</em> gene, which confers high-level resistance to kanamycin and abolishes the synergistic effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a>. Therefore, with minor exceptions, gentamicin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a> are the only two aminoglycosides that should be considered to achieve synergistic therapy when treating enterococcal infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">High-level resistance to streptomycin and gentamicin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the more serious of the acquired resistances of enterococci is high-level resistance to both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a>. The significance of high-level resistance to these aminoglycosides is that it eliminates the synergism expected between gentamicin or streptomycin and a cell wall&ndash;active agent such as penicillin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>.</p><p>A striking report of this phenomenon in 1959 described an enterococcus from a patient with endocarditis that was not killed by the combination of penicillin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The patient had relapsing disease and was subsequently treated by penicillin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neomycin</a> (the only other aminoglycoside available at that time). While this combination produced a clinical cure, it also produced deafness and resulted in an article entitled &quot;Deaf or dead&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].
