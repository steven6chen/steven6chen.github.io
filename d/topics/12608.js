Vaso-occlusion results in recurrent painful episodes (previously called sickle cell crisis) and a variety of serious organ system complications that can lead to life-long disabilities and even death. Hemolysis of red blood cells (RBC) causes chronic anemia and pigment gallstones. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are multiple components to the management of SCD, including the prevention and treatment of the complications of SCD, as well as the potential cure for this illness:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prevention of complications</strong> &ndash; Primary prevention of the acute complications of SCD includes routine health management with a hematologist or a health care provider with expertise in SCD. Initial prevention of complications includes the use of penicillin prophylaxis started in the newborn period, appropriate immunizations, and blood transfusions for those at risk for stroke. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Infection prevention'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The only US Food and Drug Administration approved therapy to prevent pain episodes in SCD is the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> to reduce sickle hemoglobin polymerization process by increasing the production of fetal hemoglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Routine office visits are used to educate the affected individual and family about SCD, infection prevention, pain management strategies, and anticipatory guidance for possible complications (eg, splenic sequestration, avascular necrosis of the femoral head, stroke, leg ulcers). Education regarding the nature of the disease, genetic counseling, and psychosocial assessments of individuals and their families are also best accomplished during these visits, reinforced, when possible, with telephone-based outreach programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>In addition, obtaining steady state laboratory values (eg, hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, white blood cell count, pulse oximetry readings) during routine visits will provide standards for comparison during clinical exacerbations, because these values are often abnormal at baseline.</p><p>A comprehensive health care maintenance program for SCD individuals should include the components discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

Their clinical course from these infections is often more severe than individuals without SCD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease#H2922132476\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Infection'</a>.)</p><p>The two major measures for preventing infection in individuals with SCD are immunization for all patients, and prophylactic penicillin for all young children (eg, &lt;5 years of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A review of the patient's immunizations should be performed at every medical contact to ensure that they are up to date, and parents of young children should confirm that prophylactic penicillin is being used appropriately. Infection prevention in those with variant sickle cell syndromes (eg, hemoglobin SC, sickle cell-beta thalassemia) depends on the degree of functional asplenia. (See <a href=\"#H3503253\" class=\"local\">'Immunizations'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic penicillin'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3506611\" class=\"local\">'Variant sickle cell syndromes'</a> below.)</p><p>Parents of infants and children with SCD should also be instructed regarding early recognition of infection, which may present with isolated fever. A formal plan should be created for seeking medical attention for a predetermined elevated temperature (&gt;38.5&deg;C or &gt;101.5&deg;F), and a strategy discussed regarding plans in case a fever develops during travel or when visiting with family members who may not be familiar with the routine. Adults should also have a clear plan for seeking medical attention for signs of infection. Fever should be considered a <strong>medical emergency</strong> requiring prompt medical attention, blood culture, and treatment with antibiotics. This important issue is discussed separately.

In addition, since pulmonary hypertension is associated with the development of lower extremity ulcers, we evaluate for pulmonary hypertension with a transthoracic Doppler echocardiography and obtain a complete blood count (CBC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, and serum chemistries.

The rationale includes a lack of data showing a morbidity or mortality benefit from detecting an elevated tricuspid jet regurgitant velocity by echocardiography in children; the burden and cost of increased screening for some patients; the potential risks of subsequent invasive testing; and concerns that the measurement of elevated tricuspid jet regurgitant velocity in children may not be reliable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>]. Additional concerns include the relative priority of this screening amongst the large number of other testing required, which may be burdensome and expensive for the patient and family.

We suggest a fast-acting oral or intravenous opiate as initial therapy, rather than a non-opiate analgesic (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Management of acute pain episodes, chronic pain, and opioid side effects is discussed in detail separately.

(See <a href=\"#H758521\" class=\"local\">'Hydration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults with SCD who are admitted to the hospital with an acute medical illness should receive thromboprophylaxis unless they have a contraindication.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do<strong> not</strong> use granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in individuals with SCD, due to the risk of multiorgan failure and death. However, there may be a rare case in which the potential benefits of G-CSF therapy outweigh these risks, and the judicious use of G-CSF may be justified. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Avoidance of G-CSF'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only available curative option in individuals with SCD. This important issue is discussed separately.

In regions where comprehensive care is available, the disease has shifted from a fatal pediatric illness to a chronic disease often associated with progressive deterioration in quality-of-life and organ function.
