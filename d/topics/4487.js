This is particularly true when the needs and wishes of the adolescent conflict with the opinions and preferences of the parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/consent-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The laws governing consent and confidentiality in adolescent health care vary from country to country; within the United States, they vary from state to state. The specific provisions of consent laws and confidentiality laws also vary and are not identical to each other. The information in this topic focuses on consent in adolescent health care in the United States.</p><p>Clinicians who treat adolescents must be aware of the federal and state laws related to adolescent consent and confidentiality. The circumstances in which adolescents may consent for their own care and in which confidentiality is protected vary from state to state depending upon the adolescent's status as a minor or adult, the service involved, and the provider's level of concern regarding harm to the patient or others.</p><p>The basic laws governing consent for health care are state laws; clinicians who treat adolescents need to be aware of the laws in their state. Confidentiality provisions are found in both state and federal law. Clinicians who treat adolescents also must be aware of the guidelines governing federal and state funding sources for particular services, particularly when funding source guidelines contain specific requirements related to confidentiality. They should also be familiar with the consent and confidentiality policies of the facility in which they practice, and they must be aware of potential ways in which confidentiality can be compromised (eg, record keeping, billing statements, insurance claims).</p><p>After a review of important aspects of minor status and the definitions of consent, notification, and judicial bypass, this topic will discuss how minor status affects the ability to consent to medical services and the different types of medical services for which minors are able to give their own consent. Confidentiality, a closely related but separate concept, is discussed elsewhere.

Various categories of minors &ndash; unemancipated, emancipated, medically emancipated, or mature minors &ndash; may be able to give their own consent depending upon the specific circumstances. The laws governing minor status vary from state to state.

In a few states, 19 years is the age of majority [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/consent-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Emancipated minor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emancipation refers to the process by which minors can attain legal adulthood before reaching the age of majority. Most states have statutes or court cases that specify the circumstances under which a minor can be considered emancipated from his or her parents before he or she reaches the age of majority. This may or may not require obtaining a formal court declaration of emancipation. The most common means of attaining emancipation are marriage, military service, or living separately from parents and managing one's own financial affairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/consent-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>In most cases, legal emancipation enables the minor to establish a personal residence and enter into legally binding contracts. It relieves the emancipated minor's parents from legal liability for contracts entered into by the minor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/consent-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>].

However, as a concept, and in practical terms, it is recognized to some degree in all states.

The medically emancipated minor maintains minority status in other domains (eg, he or she cannot enter into most legally binding contracts). Medically emancipated minors may be financially responsible for the medical care for which they give their own consent depending on state law.

In such states, a pregnant minor may be able to consent for prenatal care under the mature minor doctrine unless she is unable to give informed consent. Among the states that explicitly permit minors to consent, approximately one-third permit a clinician to inform the minor's parents under certain circumstances (eg, if it is necessary in order to protect the health of the minor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/consent-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

However, under these decisions, when states do have such a requirement, an alternative must also be in place that allows minors to obtain an abortion without first going to their parents if they are mature enough to make their own decision or the abortion is in their best interest. This procedure is most commonly a &quot;judicial bypass,&quot; discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/consent-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/3,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,35</a>].</p><p>The majority of states require some parental involvement in a minor's decision to have an abortion (approximately two-thirds of these require parental consent, and one-third require parental notification, but not consent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/consent-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Judicial bypass is a process by which a minor petitions the court to allow for an abortion to take place without notifying the minor's parent(s), either because she is mature enough to give her own consent or because an abortion without parental involvement would be in her best interests. Each state has its own guidelines for this process. States may allow for a court-appointed lawyer for free, and a time limit is provided for the decision to be handed down by the court.

When minors and parents disagree about treatment for substance abuse, some states defer to the minor and some to the parent, but the majority do not specify whether the minor's or the parent's decision is controlling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/consent-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Parents may not be aware that adolescents can provide consent for the treatment of drug or alcohol dependency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/consent-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a survey of the parents of adolescents from one Midwestern state, only 13 percent of parents knew their state law permitted adolescents to consent for treatment of drug or alcohol dependency; 23 percent thought such a law was bad, 52 percent thought it was good, and 24 percent thought it was neither [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/consent-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>When considering whether to notify parents in the states where parental notification is permitted, clinicians must consider whether the adolescent is capable of providing informed consent and whether parental involvement would affect treatment positively or negatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/consent-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].
