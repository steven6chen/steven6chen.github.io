Both are RNA viruses belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family and grouped under the genus <em>Henipavirus</em>, since they share antigenic, serological, and ultrastructural characteristics and differ from other paramyxoviruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Another virus in the genus is the non-pathogenic Cedar virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Nipah virus caused an outbreak in pigs and humans in Malaysia and Singapore between 1998 and 1999, and has caused recurrent human outbreaks in Bangladesh and West Bengal, India since 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-13</a>]. An outbreak of henipavirus infection, most likely due to Nipah or a Nipah-like virus, occurred in the Philippines in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Hendra virus infections affecting horses and humans have occurred in Australia since 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NIPAH VIRUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nipah virus was initially discovered when it caused an outbreak of viral encephalitis among pig farmers in Malaysia. The virus was named after a village in Malaysia, where the infected patient lived. Since then, there have been several outbreaks of acute Nipah encephalitis in various districts in Bangladesh, in the neighboring district of Siliguri in India, and in the Southern Philippines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/13,14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology of Nipah virus infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The outbreak in Malaysia was initially thought to be Japanese encephalitis (JE), which is endemic in Asia. However, certain features were not consistent with this diagnosis: the occurrence of encephalitis among adults rather than children, the clustering of cases in the same household, and a history of illness in pigs belonging to the affected farmers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. Furthermore, a high number of patients had been vaccinated against JE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthropod-borne-encephalitides#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arthropod-borne encephalitides&quot;, section on 'Japanese encephalitis virus'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Animal reservoirs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary animal reservoirs of henipaviruses are bats of the genus <em>Pteropus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/20-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-25</a>]. Antibodies against Nipah antigens were found in bats from Malaysia and Bangladesh, and the virus was isolated from urine of bats of the species <em>Pteropus hypomelanus</em> roosting in the East Coast of Malaysia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/10,20,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,20,24</a>]. Since then, serological evidence of Nipah virus infection have been found in 23 species of bats from 10 genera in regions as widely spread as Yunan and Hainan Island in China, Cambodia, Thailand, India, Madagascar, and Ghana in West Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Other animals can be intermediate hosts for the virus. As an example, in the Malaysian outbreak, these were pigs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. Unlike in JE, Nipah-infected pigs had clinical disease manifested by neurologic and respiratory symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The mode of transmission between pigs was probably through direct contact with infected fluids such as urine, saliva, pharyngeal and bronchial secretions. Domestic animals such as cats and dogs were also shown to have a positive serology for Nipah virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In the Philippines outbreak, horses were thought to be the intermediate hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Transmission to humans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the Malaysian outbreak, human infection occurred through direct contact with respiratory secretions and urine from infected pigs. Case control studies showed that Nipah infected persons were more likely than controls to have had direct contact with pigs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Other affected patients were those who had occupational contact, including abattoir workers and pork sellers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. In a study of military personnel involved in pig culling during the outbreak, 6 of the 1412 personnel (0.4 percent) studied had detectable antibody against Nipah virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. All six had IgM antibodies and one person also had IgG antibodies. Two of the six had clinical encephalitis. There was also evidence that Nipah virus may have been transmitted from person to person. As an example, a nurse in the Malaysian outbreak who had cared for Nipah virus-infected patients was found to be seropositive and have MRI findings typical of Nipah encephalitis, despite the fact that she had no exposure to infected animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In Bangladesh, there was an initial report of Nipah virus infection in 2001, and since then recurrent outbreaks have occurred almost annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Unlike the Malaysian outbreaks, no clusters of ill animals have been reported and a case-control study found that there was no increased risk of Nipah virus infection among individuals who had contact with a potential intermediate host (such as a pig) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/10,12,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12,35</a>]. Nipah infection resulted from bat-to-human (eg, direct contact with bats or their secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated by bat saliva [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]) and human-to-human transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. As an example, human-to-human transmission was important in the 2004 outbreak, in which 33 of 36 reported cases had a history of close contact with another infected patient prior to the onset of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Among patients with Nipah virus infection secondary to exposure from an infected patient, the median incubation period was nine days (range, 6 to 11 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>In the Philippine outbreak, there was evidence of horse-to-human and human-to-human transmission. Ten of 17 patients (59 percent) had either been involved in slaughtering horses or consuming infected horse meat, while most of the others, including two healthcare workers, helped care for patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. &#160; &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features of Nipah virus infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nipah virus causes primarily an encephalitic syndrome with a high mortality rate of approximately 30 to 40 percent in Malaysia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and greater than 70 percent in Bangladesh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The incubation period ranged from 7 to 40 days. The initial presentation is non-specific, characterized by the sudden onset of fever, headache, myalgia, nausea and vomiting. Meningismus is seen in approximately one-third of patients although marked nuchal rigidity and photophobia are uncommon.</p><p>In approximately 60 percent of patients, the disease rapidly progresses, with deterioration in consciousness leading to coma within five to seven days. Generalized seizures occur in approximately 20 percent of patients. Other neurologic findings associated with Nipah encephalitis include: segmental myoclonus (involving predominantly the diaphragm, upper limb and neck musculature), cerebellar dysfunction, tremors, and areflexia. Brainstem involvement, characterized by pinpoint, unreactive pupils, abnormal Doll's eye reflex, tachycardia and hypertension, occurs in the more severe cases and portends a poorer prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A smaller number of patients may present with atypical pneumonia with chest radiographs showing diffuse interstitial infiltrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/8,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,19</a>]. Patients in the Bangladesh outbreaks also had an encephalitic syndrome but respiratory symptoms and abnormal chest radiographs were seen in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>Some patients had relapsing encephalitis presenting as recurrent episodes of neurological dysfunction. In addition, a few patients who were initially asymptomatic, or who had mild non-encephalitic illness initially, developed late onset neurological disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. These patients presented with fever, headache, seizures and focal neurological signs. Mortality was 18 percent. MRI scans showed large patchy, confluent lesions that differed from the initial findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. There was some similarity to a fatal case of Hendra viral encephalitis (see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Long-term follow-up of survivors showed that persistent fatigue and daytime somnolence were common disabling symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Functional neurologic impairment was also common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The laboratory abnormalities in Nipah encephalitis are also nonspecific. Leukocyte counts are usually normal but moderate thrombocytopenia can occur. The liver transaminases were elevated in the mild-to-moderate range, but clinical jaundice was not a feature of the illness.</p><p>Abnormalities of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were observed in the majority of cases. Most had an increased white blood cell count (range 10 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm3),</span> with lymphocyte predominance, and an elevated protein concentration (range 50 to 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>. The CSF glucose concentration was normal, and red blood cells were not usually present. These findings are in keeping with the CSF abnormalities seen in most other viral encephalitides. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=viral-encephalitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Viral encephalitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a useful tool in the diagnosis of Nipah encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/40,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,43</a>] although it does not distinguish this form of encephalitis from other viral encephalitides. The characteristic MRI abnormalities are multiple, small (less than 5 mm), asymmetric focal lesions in the subcortical and deep white matter without surrounding edema. These lesions most probably represent areas of micro-infarction that have also been observed on histopathology. There is no correlation between MRI findings and focal neurological signs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Electroencephalogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The electroencephalogram (EEG) shows continuous diffuse slow waves with or without periodic bitemporal independent sharp wave discharges.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis of Nipah virus infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reference standard for diagnosis is detection of serum neutralizing antibodies against Nipah virus in the patient&rsquo;s serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, virus isolation is not routinely done since Nipah virus is classified as a biosafety level 4 agent. Thus, other methods, such as serology or polymerase chain reaction, are more commonly employed. The novel use of neutralization assays on pseudotyped viruses bearing Nipah virus glycoproteins may be a way to avoid the need for live viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/14,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,45,46</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Enzyme-linked immunoassay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of Nipah virus infection can be established by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). An IgM capture ELISA and an indirect IgG ELISA have high specificity for the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Rapid immune plaque assays have been developed to quantify Hendra and Nipah viruses and detect neutralizing antibodies to both viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Polymerase chain reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are currently in routine use at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These RT PCRs can be used for detection of viral sequences in fixed or fresh tissue or CSF diagnostic specimens or as an adjunct to the rapid characterization of viral isolates from cell culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pathologic findings in the brains of patients with Nipah encephalitis have shown evidence of necrotizing vasculitis and syncytial formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/18,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,48</a>]. In addition, there was widespread central nervous system (CNS) involvement due to severe vasculitis of mainly small blood vessels, which resulted in endothelial damage (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary angiitis of the central nervous system in adults&quot;</a>). Eosinophilic cytoplasmic and nuclear viral inclusions were detected in many neurons adjacent to vasculitic vessels, a finding which is present in infections caused by other paramyxoviruses. The main pathology appeared to be widespread ischemia and infarction caused by vasculitis-induced thrombosis, although direct neuronal invasion may also play a major role in the pathogenesis of the encephalitis.</p><p>In relapsed Nipah virus encephalitis, the pathology was confined to the central nervous system with extensive and confluent parenchymal necrosis, edema, and inflammation, but without vasculitis and endothelial syncytia and thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/39,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,48</a>]. The presence of viral inclusions supported recurrent infection rather than a post-infectious encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapy of Nipah virus infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment, and infected patients may require intensive care monitoring. Mechanical ventilation for airway protection should be initiated with the onset of neurologic deterioration. In the Malaysian outbreak, anti-thrombotic agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and pentoxyfylline, were administered in some patients based upon the recognition that arterial thrombosis may play an important role in the CNS disease. These drugs were not used in a systematic fashion to allow evaluation of their efficacy.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ribavirin</a>, a nucleoside analogue, was also given empirically as it has a broad spectrum of activity against RNA and DNA viruses. In the Malaysian outbreak, 140 treated patients were compared to 54 control patients who did not receive ribavirin. Fewer treated patients died (32 percent versus 54 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, treated patients were identified later in the outbreak so it is possible that they were given better general medical care compared to untreated patients seen earlier. Subsequent animal models found that ribavirin, as well as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a>, were ineffective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">HENDRA VIRUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In September of 1994, an outbreak of acute, severe respiratory illness resulting in the death of 14 of 21 affected horses occurred in Queensland, Australia. Two humans, a trainer and a stable hand with close contact to these sick horses became ill and the trainer died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

Human infection results from direct contact with infected horses. No human-to-human transmission has been documented.</p><p>Similar to Nipah virus, the natural host of Hendra virus is believed to be fruit bats of the <em>Pteropus</em> species, four of which have been demonstrated to have serologic evidence of infection with this virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The virus has also been isolated from fetal tissue and uterine fluids of these bats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Although the virus appears to be widespread in the bat population, there is no clinical evidence of infection or seroconversion among bat caregivers, despite close contact with these mammals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The mode of transmission of the virus from the natural hosts to the infected horses in the outbreak is unclear and the focus of reducing future henipavirus infections is to identify factors that will trigger a spillover infection from bats to livestock and humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features of Hendra virus infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the recognition of the virus, there have been 11 infections from bats to horse, with four identified human infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipah-and-hendra-viral-encephalitis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].
