The use of active surveillance for patients with localized low-risk prostate cancer has been endorsed by key guideline-setting groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) guidelines, which have been endorsed by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), recommend active surveillance for most patients with low-grade (grade group 1 [Gleason 6] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110728\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728 \">table 1</a>)), localized prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Active surveillance may also be considered for patients with grade group 2 (Gleason score 7 [3+4]), who have low-volume and percentage Gleason 4 pattern pathology (&lt;10 to 20 percent pattern 4), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> age older than 75 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Factors such as younger age (&lt;55 years), high-volume disease, patient preference, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> African-American ethnicity should be taken into account. For patients with a limited life expectancy (&lt;5 years) and low-risk prostate cancer, watchful waiting may be more appropriate than active surveillance. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines define a very-low-risk group, which includes the criteria for the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) prognostic stage group I in the 2017 TNM staging system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, these patients must have fewer than three positive biopsy cores, with &le;50 percent cancer in each core, and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density &lt;0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL/g</span>. In this very-low-risk group, the NCCN recommends active surveillance as the preferred option for those with a life expectancy less than 20 years. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For the low-risk group (prognostic stage group I), the NCCN considers active surveillance an option, along with radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy, for those with a life expectancy &gt;10 years. For those with a life expectancy &lt;10 years, these guidelines recommend observation, with the expectation to deliver palliative therapy for the development of symptoms, or a change in exam or PSA that suggests symptoms are imminent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The distinction between low and very low risk, based on volume of histologic grade group 1 (Gleason 6) cancer and PSA density, is based on several studies, which demonstrate a correlation between higher volume low-grade cancer and the presence of occult higher grade cancer. There is a consensus, however, that in the absence of higher grade cancer, the metastatic potential of grade group 1 is virtually zero. Thus, patients with higher volume grade group 1 (Gleason 6) may warrant more intensive evaluation (ie, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> more extensive biopsies). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">NCCN guidelines also consider active surveillance an option for patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American Urological Association (AUA) considers active surveillance, interstitial brachytherapy, external beam radiation therapy, and radical prostatectomy appropriate treatment options for patients with low and intermediate-risk prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These guidelines concluded that the available data on outcomes and complications were insufficient to recommend any one form of treatment over another for any risk category of disease. These guidelines recommend that all men with clinically localized prostate cancer be informed about all four of these treatment strategies, with a discussion of estimated benefit as well as harm from each intervention. </p><p/><p>Particular caution should be exercised if active surveillance is being considered in men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The poorer outcome for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer managed with active surveillance may be explained by the higher likelihood of more advanced, undetected disease. A retrospective study analyzed 608 patients with low-volume intermediate-risk prostate cancer (one or two positive cores, Gleason grade group 2 [Gleason 3+4 = 7], PSA &le;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> who underwent immediate radical prostatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In this cohort, 24.7 percent had an adverse pathologic finding at surgery, including 23.2 percent with Gleason 4+3 = 7 or greater, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a seminal vesicle or lymph node metastasis. In contrast, 5.8 percent of those with low-risk disease and 4.7 percent of those with very-low-risk disease were found to have advanced pathologic findings at surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis of 945 of patients compared outcomes in 237 patients with intermediate-risk disease versus the 708 patients with low-risk disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Cancer specific survival was significantly poorer at 15 years for those with intermediate-risk disease (88.5 versus 96.3 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 3.75, 95% CI 1.37-10.28), and there was an increased risk of developing metastatic disease (4.6 percent versus 0.8 percent). Overall survival for intermediate-risk patients was also worse (15-year overall survival 50 versus 69 percent, HR 2.08, 95% CI 1.49-2.89), although this may reflect differences in the patient populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>The application of these criteria or of nomograms for helping a patient to decide whether to pursue active surveillance must be carefully individualized. Active surveillance for intermediate-risk disease may be particularly appropriate in patients who are older <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> those with significant comorbidity. Treatment-related toxicity (impotence, incontinence, acute surgical complications) appears to be more frequent in older men, making a more inclusive approach to active surveillance more attractive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The strength of MRI in the setting of surveillance is data from numerous sources reporting a high negative predictive value (between 85 and 100 percent) for clinically significant disease. The limitation of the conventional approach to surveillance has been the misclassification of risk in 25 to 30 percent of patients, based on the presence of occult higher grade cancer in men whose biopsy shows only Gleason 6. MRI appears to be accurate at identifying many of these patients, which should improve the long-term mortality rate. A negative MRI also provides reassurance to patients that their disease is truly low risk and, thus, may improve retention of an active surveillance approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although controversial, several sites have recommended a repeat prostate biopsy before committing to a plan for active surveillance in order to identify patients in whom the original biopsy may have missed evidence of increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Delaying this biopsy for six months to a year is unlikely to have an impact on long-term outcome, even if higher grade disease is eventually identified. In most such patients, upgrading is to Gleason 3+4, and delayed treatment is still effective. (See <a href=\"#H4034362282\" class=\"local\">'Prostate biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some groups have incorporated the number of positive cores on the original biopsy, the percentage of positive cores, the extent of tumor involvement within a biopsy core, the PSA density, and PSA kinetics, but these parameters have not been shown to add discriminatory value and have not been incorporated into patient selection guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/1,2,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In older patients, a comprehensive geriatric assessment may be useful in determining whether a definitive intervention, active surveillance, or watchful waiting is most appropriate.

In this population, prostate cancer has a significantly earlier age of onset, higher PSA levels, worse Gleason scores, and more advanced stage of disease at presentation. These associations are multi-factorial, and may also reflect issues of access to care and early detection as well as inherent genetic and environmental factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Ethnicity'</a>.)</p><p>The potential increased risk with active surveillance is illustrated by the outcomes in which a series of African American men who chose radical prostatectomy for very-low-risk prostate cancer were compared with a comparable group of men of white or other races [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. All men had clinical stage T1c disease, biopsy Gleason score &le;6 using contemporary Gleason criteria, no more than two positive biopsy cores, less than 50 percent involvement in any one core, PSA &le;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> and a PSA density &le;0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL/cm<sup>3</sup></span>. In the radical prostatectomy specimens, the African American men had significantly higher rates of upgrading of their Gleason pathology (33 versus 13 percent) and positive surgical margins (19 versus 6 percent). On multivariable analysis, the increased risk of unfavorable findings at prostatectomy was statistically significant compared with the combined results for white and other races. </p><p>However, the majority of black men who choose active surveillance are able to avoid overtreatment. Ethnicity is only one of many factors that should be taken into consideration in the selection of active surveillance or active treatment. MRI <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> molecular biomarkers may facilitate the confidence with which patients with Gleason 6 cancer and other risk factors (race, family history) can be offered surveillance, as well as those with favorable intermediate-risk disease.

Following this, subsequent biopsies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> MRI are repeated to look for evidence of biologic progression to Gleason 4+3 (grade group 2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F107132\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107132 \">table 2</a>)) or higher. </p><p>The results of repeat biopsy are illustrated by a study of 657 men in the Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study (PASS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. All men had a Gleason score &le;3+4 and had less than 34 percent involvement at diagnosis. On the initial repeat biopsy (12 months after diagnosis), 32 percent had no cancer detected, 43 percent were not reclassified, and 25 percent had evidence of higher risk disease. Of those not reclassified, 313 underwent a second prostate needle biopsy 24 months after diagnosis. On that biopsy, no cancer was detected in 38 percent, there was no reclassification in 44 percent, and higher risk disease was identified in 17 percent.</p><p>A comparative analysis of individual patient data from four major centers with long-term experience using active surveillance found substantial variations between centers in the risk of biopsy upgrading on repeat biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Nonetheless, the study concluded that a strategy of biennial biopsies <strong>after an initial confirmatory biopsy</strong> was consistent with treatment delays of less than six to eight months in detecting progression, which are unlikely to have a significant effect on long-term treatment outcomes.

These results are illustrated by the following large studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the multicenter international PRIAS study, 5302 patients with low-risk prostate cancer were managed prospectively with active surveillance according to a predefined protocol consistent with other active surveillance protocols; 622 patients were followed on active surveillance for &gt;5 years and 107 for &gt;7.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. For the entire cohort, 99 percent of patients had Gleason 6 (grade group 1) disease, 88 percent had clinical T1 disease, and 11 percent had clinical T2a disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">At five and 10 years of follow-up, 52 and 73 percent, respectively, of men had discontinued active surveillance. Of those discontinuing active surveillance, 62 percent did so because of reclassification as higher risk. Among the patients subsequently treated with radical prostatectomy, one-third were found to still have favorable pathologic features (Gleason 6, pT2). As of the 2016 report, 30 men in the entire study had a biochemical recurrence following definitive treatment, 10 had local recurrence, eight developed metastases, and one died of prostate cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An analysis of the criteria used to initiate definitive treatment found that only Gleason upgrading (Gleason &ge;7) or clinical T3 disease was predictive of unfavorable pathologic features. A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time of zero to three years and the presence of more than two positive cores, which were originally criteria for definitive treatment, were not predictive of unfavorable pathology on subsequent radical prostatectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective database from Toronto included men who were initially managed with active surveillance beginning in 1995 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The patient population included those with low-risk disease (Gleason score &le;6 and serum PSA &le;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> and those with favorable intermediate-risk disease (serum PSA &le;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or a Gleason score 7 [3+4]) who had significant comorbidity or a life expectancy less than 10 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The most recent analysis of this database included 945 patients, 732 with low-risk disease and 213 with intermediate-risk disease. With a median follow-up of approximately 6.5 years, metastasis-free survival at 10 and 15 years was 96 and 95 percent, respectively for those with low-risk disease. For those with intermediate-risk disease, the 10- and 15-year metastasis-free survival rates were 91 and 82 percent. The worse outcome in those with intermediate-risk disease was primarily associated with Gleason 7 (3+4) disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Johns Hopkins experience, 1298 men have been followed for a median of five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Planned follow-up included annual repeat prostate biopsy. The cumulative incidences of grade reclassification at 10 and 15 years were 26 and 31 percent, respectively; factors associated with an increased incidence of grade reclassification included older age, PSA density, and number of positive cores. The 10- and 15-year rates of curative intervention were 50 and 57 percent, respectively; increased PSA density and a greater number of positive biopsy cores were associated with an increased incidence of definitive therapy. Their more stringent approach to active surveillance eligibility (confined to very low risk for men &lt;70 in younger men, and low risk in older men) was associated with a 15-year prostate-cancer-mortality of only 0.4 percent. This emphasizes both the extremely low risk of active surveillance as a management strategy and the trade-offs involved in a more inclusive approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The reasons men discontinue active surveillance were analyzed in a series of 1729 men in a Swedish database who were followed for a minimum of five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. At five years, 64 percent of the men remained on active surveillance. Discontinuation of active surveillance was due to PSA progression, biopsy progression, or personal preference in 52, 24, and 20 percent of cases, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Randomized trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A definitive assessment of the role of active surveillance in favorable-risk prostate cancer patients requires a direct comparison between immediate treatment and active surveillance including definitive treatment for evidence of progression.</p><p>Two large older studies, the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group 4 trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] and the PIVOT trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>], compared immediate definitive therapy (radical prostatectomy) with delayed treatment for metastatic disease or symptomatic locoregional progression. Both trials provide insights into the natural history of prostate cancer, but neither trial utilized an active surveillance strategy with definitive therapy instituted if there was evidence of progression.

This approach is based upon the prolonged natural history of the prostate cancer and is an attempt to balance the risks and side effects of overtreatment against the possibility of disease progression and a lost opportunity for cure. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Rationale'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outcomes for appropriately selected patients managed with active surveillance are similar to those in patients who receive immediate definitive therapy.
