Despite the high frequency of TTH and the total disability society bears due to this primary headache, treatment has been driven more by anecdote and word-of-mouth consensus than by therapeutic trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-acute-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This situation is perhaps due to the typically mild nature of TTH, such that patients with this type of headache usually self-diagnose and self-treat unless they have concurrent migraine or develop chronic TTH.</p><p>Understanding the pathophysiology of TTH is likely the key to formulating a mechanistically sound, optimum treatment plan. Unfortunately, the scientific understanding of TTH lags that of migraine, and the postulated TTH mechanisms have produced limited treatment leads. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tension-type headache in adults: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the acute treatment of TTH in adults. Preventive treatment of TTH is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tension-type headache in adults: Preventive treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other aspects of TTH are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tension-type headache in adults: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The acute or abortive (symptomatic) therapy of TTH ranges from nonpharmacologic therapies to simple and combination analgesic medications. In most cases, the treatment of TTH is largely self-directed using over-the-counter medications without any input from a medical provider. Some general principles are relevant to the pharmacologic therapy of TTH:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with migraine, abortive therapy is more effective when given early after headache onset. By analogy, it has been presumed that the earlier the treatment is given for TTH, the better, although no valid data exist. Another unproven assumption is that greater headache severity prior to treatment is a risk factor for failure of treatment with simple analgesics. While data are limited, a post hoc analysis of a trial evaluating <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> in episodic TTH suggests that pretreatment headache intensity is not clearly related to treatment success or failure with aspirin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-acute-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute treatment of migraine in adults&quot;, section on 'Approach to treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Starting with the maximum initial medication dose in acute therapy is customary, with the goal of limiting later repetitive doses. However, there is no definitive evidence to support this principle, even though a dose ranging curve likely exists with simple analgesics. Ideally, treatment should be individualized. Some patients may obtain good relief with low analgesic doses. In such cases, a higher dose trial can be employed if recurrences are frequent, although it is not a foregone conclusion that higher doses will prevent recurrence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effectiveness of analgesics tends to decrease with increasing headache frequency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic TTH is often associated with comorbid stress, anxiety, and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-acute-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In this setting, simple analgesics are usually of little or no benefit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding medication overuse headache (MOH) is an important goal of therapy. Therefore, management of TTH ideally requires limitation of acute therapy. The use of triptans (for patients with comorbid migraine) or over-the-counter combination analgesics should be limited to 9 or fewer days a month on average, butalbital-containing analgesics to 3 or fewer days a month, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to 15 or fewer days a month to prevent medication overuse headache. The more restrictive limits on butalbital-containing analgesics are due to their high potential for MOH. In general, it is best to avoid the use of opioids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> butalbital for the regular management of primary headaches. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medication overuse headache: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Causal medications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medication overuse headache: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Follow-up and relapse prevention'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preventive treatment is recommended for patients with TTH who exhibit any increase in headache frequency or disability, or for patients who have long-duration headaches. &quot;Preemptive&quot; prophylaxis (ie, employing prophylactic techniques before the headaches become chronic) should be considered and discussed with the patient whenever acute medication requests increase even a little, or when stress, muscle, or emotional factors worsen or are anticipated to worsen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tension-type headache in adults: Preventive treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Judging the success of acute treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Validated criteria for judging the effectiveness of acute TTH therapy in clinical practice are not yet available, but such criteria do exist for acute migraine treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-acute-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In the absence of specific TTH measures, the migraine criteria can be used by practitioners to judge the success of acute TTH treatment and to identify patients who may benefit from a change in therapy.</p><p>Reasonable goals for an acute headache treatment regimen include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient pain-free and functioning normally in two to four hours (at most) after the treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the treatment work consistently without routine headache recurrence? (ie, is the treatment successful in &ge;75 percent of treatments?)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient able to plan his or her day? (ie, is disability limited?)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient comfortable with the medication side effects?

The benefit of triptans in this situation is probably due to similar mechanisms of TTH and migraine in a migraineur.

European guidelines for TTH published in 2010 concluded that triptans most likely do <strong>not</strong> have a clinically relevant effect in patients with TTH and cannot be recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-acute-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Muscle relaxants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no adequate controlled trials evaluating muscle relaxants for the treatment of TTH.

In such cases, there are two main considerations: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Least likely, but a critical consideration nevertheless, is that the headache description is consistent with TTH, but the pathophysiologic mechanism is due to a secondary headache etiology, such as a brain tumor. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The most likely diagnosis is migraine without aura; the inaccurate diagnosis often results from underreporting of migraine symptoms or disability by the patient, or from failure of the practitioner to recognize migraine. Less likely, the diagnosis of TTH is correct but the patient has chronic TTH, which is less responsive to acute therapies than episodic TTH.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of headache type is correct but acute treatment fails due to the wrong medication choice, inadequate dosage of otherwise effective medication, delayed treatment, severity of the headaches, or a very rapid progression of disability.

The role of caffeine combined with NSAIDs other than ibuprofen has not been adequately examined. For patients with TTH that is unresponsive or poorly responsive to monotherapy with simple analgesics, we suggest the use of caffeine combined with simple analgesics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). A reasonable choice is a single dose of two tablets of combined acetaminophen 250 mg, aspirin 250 mg, and caffeine 65 mg.
