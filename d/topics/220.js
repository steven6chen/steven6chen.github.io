In the 1950s, they gained popularity as weight-loss drugs and shortly thereafter became popular substances of abuse. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphetamine-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amphetamine sulfate</a> and other stimulants like ephedra have a long history of abuse in the United States. Cathinones are beta-ketone amphetamine analogs. Abuse of the new synthetic cathinones (bath salts) emerged in Europe in 2009 and spread to the United States in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-amphetamine-and-synthetic-cathinone-bath-salt-intoxication/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]; these drugs were initially marketed in the United States as &quot;bath salts&quot; or &quot;plant food&quot; to avoid restrictions under the United States Controlled Substances Act.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H350266268\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY AND CELLULAR TOXICOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phenethylamines, including traditional amphetamines and the newer synthetic compounds, share multiple pharmacodynamic properties. Stimulation of alpha and beta adrenergic receptors is primarily responsible for the acute effects of amphetamines, which include hyper-alertness, hypertension, tachycardia, mydriasis, and diaphoresis. Together, these symptoms are part of the sympathomimetic toxic syndrome (or toxidrome) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71268 \">table 1</a>). Adrenergic receptors are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-vasopressors-and-inotropes#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of vasopressors and inotropes&quot;, section on 'Physiologic mechanisms of vasoconstriction'</a>.)</p><p>Phenylethylamines cause the release of neurotransmitters, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a>, serotonin, and norepinephrine and may also inhibit their reuptake. Some cause the release of serotonin from central axons, and some are serotonin receptor agonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-amphetamine-and-synthetic-cathinone-bath-salt-intoxication/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. </p><p>Psychotic symptoms in overdose occur from excess <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> and serotonin. Ring substitutions and other &quot;designer&quot; modifications have produced various psychoactive properties. Hallucinogenic properties appear to be enhanced by greater 5HT-2a receptor agonism. </p><p>Our understanding of the mechanism of action for many of the synthetic cathinones is limited but specific actions are known for a few: methylone and pyrovalerone inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> with few serotonin effects; mephedrone favors dopamine reuptake inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-amphetamine-and-synthetic-cathinone-bath-salt-intoxication/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Cytotoxicity of hepatocytes has been reported with some of these compounds.</p><p>The synthetic cathinones are analogs of a naturally occurring substance found in the leaves of <em>Catha edulis</em> (Khat). Another synthetic cathinone, methcathinone, was widely abused in the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and the United States in the 1990s, and was banned worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-amphetamine-and-synthetic-cathinone-bath-salt-intoxication/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The most common cathinones identified in outbreaks of abuse include mephedrone (4-methylenemethcathinone), MDPV (methylenedioxypyrovalerone), methedrone (4-methoxymthcathinone), methylone (3,4-methelenedioxy-n-methcathinone) and flephedrone (4-fluoromethcathinone) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-amphetamine-and-synthetic-cathinone-bath-salt-intoxication/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In the United Kingdom, analysis of 24 &quot;legal high&quot; products found 4-fluoromethcathinone, 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), and 1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-(methylamino)pentan-1-one (pentylone,2), 3,4-methlenedioxy-alpha-pyrrolidinobutyrophenone (MDPBP).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H350266275\"><span class=\"h1\">KINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our understanding of many of the synthetic cathinones is limited, but characteristics similar to other amphetamines would be expected based upon their structural similarities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-amphetamine-and-synthetic-cathinone-bath-salt-intoxication/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Amphetamines are lipophilic compounds that readily cross the blood-brain barrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-amphetamine-and-synthetic-cathinone-bath-salt-intoxication/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This property results in rapid onset of effects when injected, inhaled, or insufflated. Oral ingestion yields peak concentrations in about two hours. Cathinone peaks after oral ingestion in about one hour. Amphetamines have large volumes of distribution (approximately 3 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg)</span>. Half-lives vary widely by drug, ranging from 3 to 24 hours, but may extend beyond 30 hours, as urinary elimination is extremely pH dependent. </p><p>The metabolism of amphetamines occurs by several hepatic pathways and elimination is primarily renal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-amphetamine-and-synthetic-cathinone-bath-salt-intoxication/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Metabolism of cathinones generally occurs by demethylation followed by glucuronidation and sulfation, with metabolites eliminated primarily in the urine and bile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-amphetamine-and-synthetic-cathinone-bath-salt-intoxication/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The relatively alkaline nature of amphetamines favors excretion in an acidic urine medium, but artificial measures to further acidify the urine entail unacceptable risks and are not recommended. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4029148\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although a history may be difficult to obtain or unreliable in the setting of acute intoxication, it is important to try to determine what drugs were taken and how much. History in the setting of drug poisoning is reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;, section on 'History'</a>.)</p><p>Patients suspected of amphetamine use may be poisoned with other substances as well. As an example, the results of a survey of 947 reported mephedrone users suggests that over 80 percent abuse other substances, including alcohol, cannabis, ecstasy (MDMA), and cocaine, both simultaneously and on separate occasions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-amphetamine-and-synthetic-cathinone-bath-salt-intoxication/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

These signs include tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, and mydriasis. Alterations in mental status can include anxiety, agitation, violent behavior, and seizures. Secondary complications can involve the kidneys, skeletal muscles, and gastrointestinal system. The most common causes of death related to amphetamine toxicity are arrhythmia, hyperthermia, and intracerebral hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-amphetamine-and-synthetic-cathinone-bath-salt-intoxication/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Inexperienced users of amphetamine may develop toxicity at a dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> but chronic abusers may tolerate much higher doses.

Self-inflicted injuries (including violent suicide) and violence against others may occur while patients are delusional. Neuropsychiatric findings may be prolonged; intoxication with MDPV (methylenedioxypyrovalerone) causes central nervous system (CNS) stimulation for approximately 48 hours. </p><p>Intoxication with typical amphetamines may produce similar effects on the CNS, but extreme neuropsychiatric symptoms and signs, which can occur following a single dosing of a synthetic cathinone, generally occur only following binge use of typical amphetamines.</p><p>Profound hyponatremia causing altered mental status, elevated intracranial pressure, and cerebral edema has been reported following abuse of mephedrone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-amphetamine-and-synthetic-cathinone-bath-salt-intoxication/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>].

Selected laboratories have successfully identified the synthetic cathinone compounds using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, but such testing is not routinely available, and is generally of no help with the acute management of intoxicated patients. Thus, such testing is usually not obtained unless needed for medico-legal reasons. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication#H252303183\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synthetic cannabinoids: Acute intoxication&quot;, section on 'Testing for synthetic cannabinoids'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H350266368\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amphetamine and synthetic cathinone toxicity is a clinical diagnosis. Serum drug concentrations are rarely available in a timely manner and therefore of limited clinical usefulness. The diagnosis is usually made on the basis of a history of abuse and clinical features consistent with an overdose of these substances, primarily symptoms and signs of a sympathomimetic syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71268 \">table 1</a>). Intoxication with amphetamines or a synthetic cathinone should be considered in any case of agitated delirium of unclear etiology. </p><p>The newer synthetic cathinones differ from traditional amphetamines in that symptoms and signs often persist for many hours to several days in some cases. In severe cases, psychiatric findings and movement disorders have persisted for days to weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-amphetamine-and-synthetic-cathinone-bath-salt-intoxication/abstract/3,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265206422\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amphetamines and the newer synthetic cathinones cause a sympathomimetic syndrome with features that range from pure adrenergic stimulation to a mixed picture of stimulant and hallucinogenic effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71268 \">table 1</a>). The most distinguishing feature of overdose with a synthetic cathinone is the prolonged duration of effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-amphetamine-and-synthetic-cathinone-bath-salt-intoxication/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Many reports of &quot;bath salt&quot; cases describe agitated delirium and psychotic features lasting for days to even weeks. These compounds should be considered a possible cause in any case with such prolonged symptoms. While psychosis is a common finding in amphetamine abuse, seizures and chest pain are more commonly seen with pure stimulants, such as cocaine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-amphetamine-and-synthetic-cathinone-bath-salt-intoxication/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Pure hallucinogens, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or psilocybin, generally do not cause adrenergic stimulation, and thus signs such as tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, and diaphoresis are not prominent findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intoxication-from-lsd-and-other-common-hallucinogens\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intoxication from LSD and other common hallucinogens&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Anticholinergic poisoning has some features that are similar to amphetamine intoxication (eg, hyperthermia, tachycardia, agitation), but the absence of diaphoresis, dilated pupils, and flushed skin helps to distinguish this syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anticholinergic-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anticholinergic poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Withdrawal, particularly from sedative hypnotics, ethanol, and benzodiazepines, can mimic amphetamine and synthetic cathinone toxicity. Withdrawal is a difficult diagnosis that requires obtaining a history of prolonged abuse followed by cessation. Giving appropriate treatment (such as a benzodiazepine) generally causes withdrawal symptoms to improve or resolve.

Patients with thyrotoxicosis often demonstrate eyelid retraction and lag, proximal muscle weakness, and a palpable goiter. Pheochromocytoma often causes intermittent hypertension, headache, and diaphoresis. Heat stroke normally develops in a hot, humid environment, either following exertion or in patients with compromised thermoregulation due to disability, old age, or medication (eg, diuretics, anticholinergics, antipsychotics).

This need may arise in patients with refractory agitation or loss of protective airway reflexes. Airway management in adults is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-emergency-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced emergency airway management in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>When performing rapid sequence intubation in patients with agitated delirium from amphetamine intoxication, it is generally best to avoid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> as an induction agent due to its dissociative effects. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propofol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a> are all reasonable agents for induction.

In such cases, the potential benefits of decontamination outweigh the risks.

Acute decompensation can occur if immediate measures are not taken to control the patient. Efforts to control agitated behavior should not be delayed while awaiting laboratory or other confirmation of drug exposure.</p><p>First line therapy for treating psychomotor agitation consists of IV benzodiazepines. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lorazepam</a> 2 mg IV or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> 10 mg IV are reasonable starting doses for patients with significant agitation. The same or half the initial dose may be repeated every three to five minutes until agitation is controlled. Large cumulative doses of benzodiazepines (hundreds of milligrams) may be required and should be utilized before abandoning this therapy. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and hypotension. Intramuscular lorazepam can be used if IV access is unavailable, but its peak effect is typically delayed (10 to 20 minutes). This approach is similar to that used to manage a pure stimulant overdose, such as cocaine or methamphetamine. </p><p>The response to the agitated patient should reflect the severity of the presentation, but a combination of physical control and chemical sedation are often necessary initially to manage severely agitated patients. To avoid complications from hyperthermia and overexertion, physical restraints should be removed as soon as chemical sedation is achieved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and emergency management of the acutely agitated or violent adult&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p>Hypovolemia is frequently associated with agitated delirium so fluid resuscitation with boluses of IV isotonic crystalloid should be given to patients with signs of volume depletion. </p><p>Although butyrophenones (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>) and second generation antipsychotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ziprasidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ziprasidone</a>) have been suggested for use in sympathomimetic ingestions, there are no controlled studies evaluating their safety and efficacy in synthetic cathinone intoxications. Since these agents interfere with heat dissipation, lower the seizure threshold, and may prolong the QTc interval, we suggest they <strong>not</strong> be used as first-line therapy for psychomotor agitation in the setting of amphetamine or synthetic cathinone intoxication. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H350266411\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperthermia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uncontrolled agitation and excessive muscle activity generate heat and cause hyperthermia (temperature &ge;41.1&deg;C). Aggressive sedation with benzodiazepines and possibly neuromuscular paralysis may be required in the agitated hyperthermic patient. The approach used is identical to that used for patients with hyperthermia following methamphetamine intoxication and is described separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methamphetamine-acute-intoxication#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methamphetamine: Acute intoxication&quot;, section on 'Hyperthermia'</a>). Supplemental measures, such as ice packs and evaporative cooling, may be necessary to prevent the mortality associated with severe hyperthermia.

We believe that optimal therapy for patients experiencing cardiovascular complications from acute sympathomimetic poisoning begins with reduction in central nervous system catecholamine release rather than peripheral antagonism of released catecholamines, and that benzodiazepines have a proven role in this regard. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-acute-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine: Acute intoxication&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hypertension that is refractory to aggressive treatment with sedatives, may require treatment with intravenous antihypertensive drugs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentolamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentolamine</a>.

Should beta blockade be performed in this setting, it should be reserved for patients with persistent hypertension despite appropriate treatment with benzodiazepines and done cautiously, ideally in combination with an alpha antagonist or some other vasodilator without beta blocking effects (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a>).

Serum electrolytes (particularly sodium) and glucose should be monitored and supplemented where necessary. Isolated seizures are treated in standard fashion.

Small children may present with crying, tachycardia, agitation, abnormal eye movements, vomiting, ataxia, or seizures. A high index of suspicion should be maintained when evaluating children from home situations known or suspected to be involved in drug use. </p><p>The treatment of children with amphetamine intoxication is similar to that of adults, but special consideration should be directed toward aggressive cooling measures and close monitoring of vital signs and urine output. Hydration should be sufficient to maintain urine output at 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span> to prevent renal injury from myoglobin deposition.
