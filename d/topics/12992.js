A review of the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of struvite stones will be presented here. The management of these stones is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of struvite or staghorn calculi&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Struvite stones are composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and calcium carbonate-apatite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-struvite-stones/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Normal urine is undersaturated with ammonium phosphate, and struvite stone formation occurs only when ammonia production is increased and the urine pH is elevated, which decreases the solubility of phosphate. The only situation in which this occurs in humans is with an upper urinary tract infection with a urease-producing organism, such as <em>Proteus</em> or <em>Klebsiella</em>. Urease breaks down urinary urea into ammonia plus carbon dioxide:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Urea &#160;&rarr; &#160;2NH<sub>3</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub></p></div></div><p>The ammonia produced by this reaction then combines with water:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;NH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O &#160;&rarr; &#160;NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>-</sup></p></div></div><p>The net result is increased availability of ammonium in an alkaline urine. This is in contrast to the usual setting of increased ammonium due to increased acid production, systemic acidosis, and low urine pH.</p><p>In comparison to those patients with pure struvite stones, many men and some women have mixed calcium oxalate and struvite stones. It is presumed that the primary event in this setting is calcium oxalate stone formation, with secondary infection and struvite deposition. In these patients, a comprehensive medical evaluation will uncover the underlying metabolic defect(s) responsible for calcium stone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-struvite-stones/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Alternatively, patients with pure struvite stones may not benefit from a metabolic evaluation but would benefit from a determination of the cause of the upper tract infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10451471\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epidemiology of struvite stone formation is, in part, sex dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-struvite-stones/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Women are more likely to form pure struvite stones (3:1) because females are more likely to develop an upper urinary tract infection. Other patients susceptible to infection, such as those with a neurogenic bladder or a urinary diversion, also may form pure struvite stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-struvite-stones/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In France, the prevalence of stones containing any struvite decreased from 11.1 percent in the 1980s to 6.1 percent in the 2000s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-struvite-stones/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In Rochester, Minnesota, only 1 percent of first stones contained struvite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-struvite-stones/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Improving care of patients at high risk for infection has shifted the epidemiology of stones in such patients. As an example, in a cohort of 33 immobile patients with musculoskeletal anomalies (traditionally at high risk for struvite stones), the proportion of stones due to infection was only 18 percent; the rest were calcium or uric acid stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-struvite-stones/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, a 2011 study of 52 patients with staghorn calculi revealed that just 44 percent were struvite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-struvite-stones/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90635667\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms directly attributable to struvite stones are uncommon. More often, patients will present with symptoms of a urinary tract infection, mild flank pain, or hematuria and will be found to have a persistently alkaline urine pH (&gt;8), often with multiple magnesium ammonium phosphate crystals in the urine sediment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F108401\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108401 \">picture 1</a>), and a complex renal calculus on plain film of the abdomen. The stone may grow rapidly over a period of weeks to months and, if not adequately treated (including complete removal and treatment of the infection), can develop into a staghorn or branched calculus filling the entire renal pelvis and calyces (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F62009\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62009 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F72669\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72669 \">image 2</a>).</p><p>A persistently infected stone often leads to focal areas of parenchymal scarring with loss of cortex (chronic pyelonephritis). Passage of a struvite stone is rare. When passed and collected or removed surgically, chemical analysis of these stones may falsely report the absence of struvite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-struvite-stones/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Thus, if the suspicion is high in the appropriate clinical setting, struvite may be present even if not identified by the analyzing laboratory.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1661092817\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTTREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Struvite stone formers should undergo a metabolic evaluation, similar to the evaluation performed in patients who form other types of kidney stones. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-established-nephrolithiasis-and-treatment-if-stone-composition-is-unknown#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult patient with established nephrolithiasis and treatment if stone composition is unknown&quot;, section on 'The complete metabolic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>The reasons are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reporting of struvite as a component of a kidney stone sent for analysis is unreliable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-struvite-stones/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and it is therefore possible that retrieved stones may have formed in the upper urinary tract due to factors other than infection with urease-producing bacteria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, the entire stone is not typically removed as a single piece, so not all components of the stone may be identified if a single piece is sent for analysis. Thus, it is possible that there was a more common type of stone present in the kidney (eg, calcium oxalate) that became secondarily infected with urease-producing bacteria and the struvite stone grew over the original stone. Because struvite stones can grow quickly and become quite large, it is possible that the original stone nidus may not be included in a sample that is sent to the laboratory for analysis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90635554\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Struvite stones are composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and calcium carbonate-apatite. Such stones only form in the setting of an upper urinary tract infection with urea-splitting bacteria, such as <em>Proteus</em> or <em>Klebsiella</em>.
