The management of pancreas divisum is discussed separately.

The frequency with which pancreas divisum is seen on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) depends upon the number of patients with pancreatitis in the study population and the completeness of pancreatography. In one retrospective study of 1825 successful consecutive ERCPs, pancreas divisum was found in 7.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The prevalence of pancreas divisum was significantly higher in patients presenting with idiopathic pancreatitis as compared with controls (50 versus 4 percent). In another retrospective study that included 809 patients who underwent ERCP, pancreas divisum was more frequent in patients with pancreatitis as compared with those with biliary diseases or obscure abdominal pain (9 versus 2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EMBRYOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1483211\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal pancreatic duct development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pancreas is formed from fusion of the dorsal and ventral anlages, which develop from the embryologic foregut (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78995\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78995 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The ventral system also gives rise to the hepatobiliary system. At approximately the seventh intrauterine week of life, the ventral pancreas rotates posterior to the duodenum and comes to rest posterior and inferior to the head portion of the dorsal pancreas. The ventral bud forms the inferior part of the head of the pancreas and the uncinate process, whereas the dorsal bud becomes the tail and the body. The ventral pancreas represents 2 to 20 percent of the pancreatic parenchymal mass. Fusion of the ductular network of the two buds gives rise to the main pancreatic duct. The accessory pancreatic duct (of Santorini), which often persists, is derived from the dorsal pancreatic duct proximal to the site of fusion. Fusion of the ductal system occurs in over 90 percent of individuals, although variations in patency of the accessory duct occur. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreas divisum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Failure of fusion of the ventral and dorsal duct system results in pancreas divisum. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21192166\"><span class=\"h3\">Subtypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three subtypes of pancreas divisum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78995\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78995 \">figure 1</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Classic (complete) pancreas divisum</strong> &ndash; The classic pancreas divisum anatomy consists of a small ventral duct, which drains through the larger major papilla, and the larger dorsal duct, which drains through the smaller minor papilla. In some cases, the entire pancreatic ductal system drains through the minor papilla via the dorsal duct. Based on autopsy data, approximately 70 percent of patients with pancreas divisum have the classic form. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Incomplete pancreas divisum</strong> &ndash; In individuals with incomplete pancreas divisum, a small branch of the ventral duct communicates with the dorsal duct. Approximately 15 percent of cases of pancreas divisum are of the incomplete type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. However, the clinical implications of incomplete pancreas divisum are the same as for classic (complete) pancreas divisum, except that modest to full visualization of the dorsal duct may occur with vigorous major papillary contrast injection on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram. (See <a href=\"#H1483969\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reverse divisum </strong>&ndash; Reverse divisum can occur in the setting of an isolated small segment of dorsal pancreas. In reverse divisum, the accessory duct of Santorini does not connect with the genu of the main pancreatic duct and can therefore be mistaken for a mimic of malignant obstruction. The physiologic significance of this anomaly is that the overflow valve to the main ductal system is absent. Thus, a gallstone that is impacted at the major papilla will likely cause more severe pancreatitis as compared with most cases of pancreatitis caused by pancreas divisum. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87041595\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathogenesis of pancreatitis in pancreas divisum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As most patients with pancreas divisum are asymptomatic, there is considerable controversy as to whether pancreas divisum is associated with pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-15</a>]. However, there appears to be a subgroup of patients with pancreas divisum that is subject to recurrent bouts of seemingly idiopathic pancreatitis. In these patients, the minor papilla orifice is so small that excessively high intrapancreatic dorsal ductal pressure occurs during active secretion, which may result in inadequate drainage, ductal distension, pain, and in some cases, pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,16-19</a>]. It has also been suggested that even low-grade intraductal hypertension makes the pancreas more prone to injury from alcohol, trauma, and drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. As the causative lesion is hypothesized to be relative stenosis of the minor papilla rather than pancreas divisum per se, this condition has been termed the dominant dorsal duct syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Genetic studies have also suggested that as many as 10 to 20 percent of patients with pancreas divisum who have pancreatitis carry at least one allele of the cystic fibrosis gene product, suggesting a multifactorial origin of pancreatitis in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

It is estimated that fewer than 5 percent of patients with pancreas divisum are symptomatic. Most symptomatic patients have infrequent bouts of pancreatobiliary-type pain or develop mild acute pancreatitis. However, a subset of symptomatic patients with pancreas divisum have recurrent pancreatobiliary-type pain, severe acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis associated with clinically significant disability due to chronic abdominal pain or pancreatic insufficiency, or pancreatitis-associated complications (eg, pseudocysts) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/33-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-38</a>].

It is often diagnosed incidentally on abdominal imaging (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogram [MRCP]) in patients who are asymptomatic or have unrelated symptoms. However, pancreas divisum should be suspected in patients with idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis. In symptomatic patients, the imaging modality of choice is MRCP, which demonstrates the failure of fusion of the ventral and dorsal duct system. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of acute pancreatitis&quot;, section on 'Determining the etiology of acute pancreatitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6680141\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to the diagnostic evaluation of pancreas divisum depends on the clinical presentation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6679979\"><span class=\"h3\">Asymptomatic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More than 95 percent of patients with pancreas divisum do not have associated symptoms. They are found to have evidence of pancreas divisum on abdominal CT performed for unrelated symptoms. In asymptomatic patients with evidence of pancreas divisum on abdominal CT scan and no evidence of acute or chronic pancreatitis or its complications (eg, pseudocysts), we do not pursue further pancreatic evaluation. </p><p>CT scan usually shows nonspecific prominence of the pancreatic head and has a low sensitivity in the diagnosis of pancreas divisum when the pancreatic duct is not visualized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. If the pancreatic duct is visualized on abdominal CT scan, axial images in patients with pancreas divisum demonstrate the dorsal duct passing anteriorly and superiorly to the terminal common bile duct and emptying separately into minor papilla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Dilation of the dorsal duct <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> changes of chronic pancreatitis that are confined to the dorsal area of the pancreas are suggestive of a pathologic minor papillary narrowing in patients with pancreas divisum. Visualization of a fat plane between the dorsal and ventral portions on CT scan is also suggestive of pancreas divisum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6680020\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptomatic or evidence of pancreatitis/complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of pancreas divisum include either infrequent bouts of pancreatobiliary-type pain or mild acute pancreatitis, or in a subset of patients, recurrent pancreatobiliary-type pain, severe acute pancreatitis, and chronic pancreatitis. In patients with pancreaticobiliary-type pain or acute or chronic pancreatitis, we perform a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a>-enhanced MRCP. If needed, we also perform an endoscopic ultrasound for a more detailed pancreatic evaluation. For those patients without symptoms associated with pancreas divisum but evidence of pancreatitis or its complications on CT scan, we also perform secretin-enhanced MRCP. We reserve endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for patients with MRCP evidence of pancreas divisum in whom endoscopic therapy is planned.

MRCP findings that are diagnostic of pancreas divisum include visualization of the dorsal pancreatic duct crossing anterior to the common bile duct and draining superiorly into the minor papilla and visualization of a separate ventral pancreatic duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Secretin enhancement has been shown to improve visualization of pancreatic ductal anatomy on MRCP. Secretin-enhanced MRCP has a sensitivity and specificity of 86 and 97 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1483969\"><span class=\"h4\">Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic findings of pancreas divisum on ERCP with dorsal ductography include the presence of a short and thin ventral duct at the major papilla and filling of the dorsal duct at the minor papilla, draining the pancreas from the tail to the head. The presence of dorsal duct dilation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic pancreatitis of the dorsal pancreas are suggestive of minor papillary narrowing. Other findings that are suggestive, but not diagnostic, of pancreas divisum on ERCP include cystic dilation of the terminal pancreatic duct (santorinicele), slow drainage of contrast from the dorsal duct (&gt;12 minutes), and pain provocation during dorsal ductography. In approximately 2 percent of patients, dorsal ductography shows an isolated small ductal system (isolated dorsal segment), which can simulate a typical ventral pancreas. Once detected, the major papilla must be cannulated to view the main pancreatic duct.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Minor</strong> <strong>papilla</strong> <strong><span class=\"nowrap\">cannulation/dorsal</strong></span> <strong>ductography</strong> <strong>technique </strong>&ndash; The minor papilla is nearly always located in the right upper quadrant of the visual field when facing the major papilla. It may be as close as 10 mm to the major papilla, or more often, as far as 2 to 3 cm (cephalad and anterior) away from the major papilla. Cannulation is generally best achieved with the endoscope pushed into the long position along the greater curve of the stomach. The tapered 5-Fr catheter with a 23- or 25-gauge blunt needle tip protruding 1 to 2 mm beyond the catheter tip is most helpful in achieving cannulation when diagnostic pancreatography is being performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. If deep cannulation (with subsequent therapy) is needed, we typically use a 0.018- or 0.021-inch guidewire through a highly tapered 5-4-3 Fr catheter. The remainder of the procedure, including contrast media and fluoroscopic techniques, is similar to conventional ERCP. In experienced hands, minor papilla cannulation can be achieved in approximately 90 to 95 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14</a>]. Failures are usually associated with minor papilla distortion from inflammation (eg, pancreatitis or peptic ulcer disease), diverticula, or tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients in whom the minor papilla orifice is not evident, we administer intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> (16 mcg) to increase pancreatic exocrine juice flow and cause visible dilation of the minor papillary orifice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, administration of secretin is not without risk during pancreatography. In the presence of vigorous juice flow, it may be difficult to force contrast media retrograde into the pancreatic tail, possibly predisposing to pancreatitis. As a result, the administration of secretin during ERCP should be limited to difficult cases. If secretin stimulation does not produce a visible increase in pancreatic juice flow, the orifice may become apparent after spraying a diluted (1:10) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> solution over the face of the minor papilla; clear juice will wash away the background blue dye at the orifice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3555444\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL TESTS FOR PATHOLOGIC PAPILLARY NARROWING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of tests have been used in patients with pancreas divisum to determine if they have pathologic narrowing of the minor papilla that may be predisposing them to develop pancreatitis. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these tests are largely undefined and correlation with a response to therapy has not been consistently demonstrated. We therefore do not routinely perform these tests. (See <a href=\"#H87041595\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of pancreatitis in pancreas divisum'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257575\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatic juice collection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients who fail to respond to minor papilla therapy, bicarbonate concentration in pancreatic juice is used to assess pancreatic duct cell function and diagnose chronic pancreatitis. Collection of less than 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a>-stimulated pancreatic juice from the minor papilla with a bicarbonate concentration of less than 105 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> is suggestive of chronic pancreatitis. Although data supporting such an approach have involved sampling of pancreatic juice from the major papilla, we believe that they can be extrapolated to the minor papilla. The evaluation of pancreatic exocrine function and diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21192022\"><span class=\"h2\">Secretin ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal pancreas shows dilation of the main pancreatic duct over a 5- to 10-minute interval after intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. While some studies have suggested that patients with pancreatic outlet obstruction may have dorsal duct dilation, which persists for more than 15 minutes after secretin administration, this has not been consistently demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22,50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,50-52</a>]. The use of secretin ultrasonography may also be problematic in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Such patients may have hyposecretory exocrine function and may not manifest dorsal duct dilation even in the presence of significant minor papilla narrowing. In addition, obesity or overlying gas can preclude visualization on ultrasonography. Although one study suggested that a positive ultrasound-secretin test is a predictor of successful accessory papilla sphincteroplasty, these results have not been validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,52</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1672247304\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic stenting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stenting of the minor papilla to determine if ductal obstruction is the cause of pancreatitis or pain is of uncertain benefit, particularly in patients with infrequent episodes of pain (one or two times a year). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1672247310\"><span class=\"h2\">Papillary manometry and patency assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Manometry of the minor papilla has not been systematically evaluated, and normal minor papilla basal pressures have not been defined. As a basal pressure of &gt;40 mmHg is considered abnormal for the major papilla, it has been suggested as a threshold for the minor papilla basal pressure. Our own limited experience with use of a standard 5-Fr triple-lumen manometry catheter (over a 0.018-inch guidewire) in previously untreated minor papillae has invariably shown very high basal pressures of &gt;200 mmHg in patients with pancreas divisum. Prior studies have found high intraductal basal pressures in the dorsal duct of patients with pancreas divisum as compared with accessory duct pressures (minor papilla cannulation) in non-divisum patients with patent major papilla orifices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

However, a subset of symptomatic patients with pancreas divisum have recurrent pancreatobiliary-type pain, severe acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis associated with clinically significant disability due to chronic abdominal pain or pancreatic insufficiency, or pancreatitis-associated complications (eg, pseudocysts). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As most patients with pancreas divisum are asymptomatic, there is considerable controversy as to whether pancreas divisum is associated with pancreatitis. However, in a subgroup of patients with pancreas divisum with recurrent bouts of seemingly idiopathic pancreatitis, there may be pathologic narrowing of the minor papillary orifice. This results in excessively high intrapancreatic dorsal ductal pressure during active secretion, which may result in inadequate drainage, ductal distension, pain, and in some cases, pancreatitis. It has also been suggested that even low-grade intraductal hypertension makes the pancreas more prone to injury from alcohol, trauma, and drugs. (See <a href=\"#H87041595\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of pancreatitis in pancreas divisum'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of pancreas divisum is established by abdominal imaging. It is often diagnosed incidentally on abdominal imaging (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogram [MRCP]) in patients who are asymptomatic or have unrelated symptoms. However, pancreas divisum should be suspected in patients with idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis. In symptomatic patients, the imaging modality of choice is MRCP, which demonstrates the failure of fusion of the ventral and dorsal duct system. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our approach to the diagnostic evaluation of pancreas divisum depends on the clinical presentation. In asymptomatic patients with evidence of pancreas divisum on abdominal CT scan and no evidence of acute or chronic pancreatitis or its complications (eg, pseudocyst), we do not pursue further evaluation. In patients with pancreaticobiliary-type pain or acute or chronic pancreatitis, we perform a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a>-enhanced MRCP. For those patients without symptoms associated with pancreas divisum but evidence of pancreatitis or its complications on CT scan, we also perform secretin-enhanced MRCP. We reserve endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram for patients with MRCP evidence of pancreas divisum in whom therapeutic intervention is planned. (See <a href=\"#H6680141\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of tests have been used in patients with pancreas divisum to determine if they have pathologic narrowing of the minor papilla that may be predisposing them to develop pancreatic symptoms. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these tests are largely undefined and correlation with a response to therapy has not been consistently demonstrated. (See <a href=\"#H3555444\" class=\"local\">'Additional tests for pathologic papillary narrowing'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Smanio T.
