While some women are highly critical of the medicalization of childbirth, others strongly seek to avoid a natural childbirth experience and are reassured by safety of contemporary cesarean delivery. </p><p>This topic will discuss issues specifically related to cesarean delivery on maternal request. General issues regarding cesarean delivery, such patient preparation, technique, post-operative care, and complications are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-preoperative-planning-and-patient-preparation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Preoperative planning and patient preparation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Surgical technique&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Postoperative issues&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery#H3731159853\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for cesarean delivery&quot;, section on 'Post-cesarean delivery analgesia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has published a detailed report on cesarean delivery on maternal request [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A synopsis of their findings, as well as subsequently published data, are provided below. These data are limited because no randomized trials on cesarean delivery for <span class=\"nowrap\">nonmedical/nonobstetrical</span> reasons have been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, conclusions about the risks and benefits of cesarean delivery on maternal request are not based upon high-quality evidence. Available observational studies have serious methodological issues or provide indirect evidence because the cesareans in randomized trials were performed for breech presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>As with any medical procedure, the risks and benefits of cesarean delivery on maternal request need to be balanced with the risks and benefits of a planned vaginal delivery. Patient-specific issues that can affect the choice of delivery route include comorbid medical conditions, body mass index, future reproductive plans, prior childbirth experiences, outcome of previous surgical procedures, and the woman's personal philosophy about childbirth.</p><p>Providing women with the best available information about pertinent childbirth issues and appropriate support may alleviate some of their concerns about attempted vaginal birth. The motivation for cesarean delivery should be determined and addressed. Every effort should be made to ensure that this is truly the desire of the patient and not a result of undue pressure from family members. Concerns about pain may be addressed by providing detailed information about obstetrical analgesia and anesthesia, as well as consultation with an anesthesiologist. Fear and anxiety stemming from personal trauma, previous childbirth experiences, or the childbirth experiences of friends and family should also be addressed. Tocophobia, which can be defined subjectively as severe anxiety or fear of pregnancy and childbirth, appears to be relatively common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It may be alleviated by interventions such as education and short individual psychotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Cost is not addressed in this topic as this depends on multiple factors and varies widely. Available evidence is conflicting regarding the cost-effectiveness of&nbsp;maternal&nbsp;request&nbsp;cesareans when compared with trial of labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110565058\"><span class=\"h1\">REASONS WOMEN OPT FOR CESAREAN DELIVERY ON REQUEST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reasons for choosing cesarean delivery on request include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Convenience of scheduled delivery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fear of the pain, process, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complications of labor and vaginal birth </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior poor labor experiences</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concerns about fetal harm from labor and vaginal birth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concerns about trauma to the pelvic floor from labor and vaginal birth, and subsequent development of symptoms associated with pelvic organ prolapse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concerns about the need for and risks of emergent cesarean or instrument-assisted vaginal delivery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need for control</p><p/><p>A patient's statement during a case conference published in a journal aptly summarizes the opinion of many women who choose cesarean delivery: &quot;I feel like there's a lot more that can go wrong in a natural birth for the baby than can go wrong in the C-section for the mom, and I feel like I'm more willing to take something happening to me than something happening to my baby&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2993823068\"><span class=\"h1\">ETHICAL ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A woman's right to be actively involved in choosing the route of her delivery is widely accepted by clinicians and patients in contemporary society and performing a cesarean delivery on maternal request in a well-informed patient is considered medically and ethically acceptable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In-depth reviews of the ethical issues are available elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/9,12-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12-18</a>]. </p><p>Professional standards do not mandate discussing the option of cesarean delivery on maternal request with every patient, given the high degree of uncertainty about its clinical benefits and risks compared with vaginal birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/13,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,19,20</a>]. Moreover, obstetricians are not obliged ethically or professionally to perform these procedures. Early referral to another health care practitioner is appropriate in such cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>When asked about cesarean delivery on maternal request, the clinician should find out the reasons for the patient's request; explore her values and emotional and social needs; address her concerns about labor and vaginal birth and any misinformation leading to those concerns (eg, unavailability of effective pain management); and engage her and possibly her support persons in a balanced discussion about the risks and benefits (relative and absolute) of the procedure over a series of visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Some clinicians have opined that clinicians should not grant a request for cesarean delivery that is first made during active labor unless they can thoroughly discuss all of the issues necessary for informed consent of this request, which is difficult intrapartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1122113720\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimates of the prevalence of cesarean delivery on maternal request range from 1 to 18 percent of all cesarean deliveries worldwide, and &lt;1 to 3 percent of all cesarean deliveries in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/18,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,22-24</a>]. These are crude estimates since birth certificates and discharge codes usually do not indicate whether a cesarean was performed at maternal request. The prevalence of the procedure appears to be increasing and correlated with increasing affluence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>Some surveys of obstetricians, urogynecologists, and colorectal surgeons have reported a preference for cesarean by request for themselves and their family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF PLANNED CESAREAN DELIVERY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Known date for delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A planned cesarean delivery is usually scheduled. A known date for delivery facilitates issues related to work, child care, and help at home for the mother and her partner. It also provides an opportunity to schedule surgery with a particular provider.</p><p>On the other hand, if a known date for delivery is the goal, induction of labor is a reasonable alternative, although induction may fail and lead to unscheduled cesarean delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoidance of postterm pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Planned cesarean deliveries are typically scheduled between 39 and 40 weeks of gestation. Thus, postterm pregnancy, which is associated with higher rates of perinatal morbidity and mortality than pregnancies delivering at term, can be avoided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postterm-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postterm pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As discussed above, if avoidance of postterm pregnancy is the goal, then induction of labor is a reasonable alternative, although induction may fail and lead to unscheduled cesarean delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduction in risks associated with unplanned surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although a planned cesarean usually results in a cesarean delivery, a planned vaginal delivery may result in any one of the following outcomes: uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal birth, instrument-assisted vaginal birth, or intrapartum cesarean delivery. Some women want to reduce their chances of having an instrument-assisted vaginal birth or intrapartum cesarean delivery because of potential risks associated with these procedures, which they perceive as worse than the risks associated with scheduled surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/1,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,29-31</a>]. An emergency cesarean delivery is often a traumatic experience for women, and has been associated with postnatal depression and posttraumatic stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=operative-vaginal-delivery#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Operative vaginal delivery&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Postoperative issues&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p>Because of the surgical risks associated with unplanned cesarean, a report on cesarean delivery commissioned by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence reported that rates of injury to the bladder or ureter, iatrogenic surgical injury, and pulmonary embolism appeared to be lower with planned cesarean than planned vaginal birth, but data were of low quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of late stillbirth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the fetus is delivered, it is no longer at risk of intrauterine fetal demise and other complications of pregnancy. The literature suggests that 1 in 500 to 1 in 1750 fetuses reach maturity in-utero and are subsequently involved in a catastrophe resulting in death or severe disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>]. The frequency of intrapartum fetal death is lower and estimated to be 1 in 5000 births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It is clear that scheduled cesarean delivery at term would save some fetuses destined for disaster: One stillbirth would be prevented per approximately 1200 surgeries at 39 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduction in nonrespiratory neonatal disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cesarean delivery prior to the onset of labor reduces or eliminates fetal morbidity and mortality related to the process of labor and vaginal birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Intrapartum complications that are potentially reduced or avoided include brachial plexus injury related to shoulder dystocia, bone trauma (fracture of clavicle, skull, humerus), and asphyxia related to intrapartum events (eg, umbilical cord prolapse, placental abruption, uterine rupture, difficult fetal extraction because of shoulder dystocia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/1,40,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,40,42</a>].</p><p>The risk of perinatal transmission of some infections (eg, herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) is also reduced by avoiding vaginal birth. The best means of protecting the neonate from maternal infection varies according to the specific infection and the absolute risk and consequences of perinatal transmission. As an example, cesarean delivery is recommended to reduce perinatal transmission of active herpes infection or HIV infection in women who do not have a low viral load, whereas passive and active neonatal immunization is adequate protection against perinatal hepatitis B transmission during vaginal birth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduction in risk of pelvic floor injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fear of perineal injury and urinary and fecal incontinence from labor and vaginal delivery is a common reason for maternal request for cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]; however, these concerns are not based on high-quality evidence.</p><p>In the Term Breech Trial, fewer women had urinary incontinence in the months after a planned cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], but urinary incontinence rates two and five years after delivery were not significantly different between women who planned cesarean delivery and those who planned vaginal births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In addition, planned cesarean delivery did not appear to confer protection against fecal incontinence compared with planned vaginal delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. However, data are discordant. Another study of women 5 to 10 years after delivery compared outcomes between those who had had cesarean deliveries without labor (n = 200), those who had cesarean deliveries in labor (n = 400), and the remainder who had a spontaneous or operative vaginal delivery (n = 400) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Compared with women with cesarean deliveries only before labor, the risk of pelvic organ prolapse was increased in women who had a spontaneous vaginal birth or an operative vaginal birth (adjusted OR [aOR] 5.64, 95% CI 2.16-14.70 and aOR 7.50, 95% CI 2.70-20.87, respectively).</p><p>Although there is some evidence from observational studies that cesarean delivery on maternal request may reduce the long-term risk of pelvic organ prolapse, the relationships between pelvic organ <span class=\"nowrap\">prolapse/urinary</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">incontinence/anal</span> incontinence and <span class=\"nowrap\">pregnancy/labor/vaginal</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">delivery/cesarean</span> delivery are not well-defined.

Moreover, these complications may necessitate cesarean hysterectomy. For this reason, cesarean delivery on maternal request should be discouraged for women desiring additional children, particularly more than three additional children, given that the risks of placenta previa, placenta accreta, and gravid hysterectomy increase with each cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis reported a significant positive association between cesarean delivery and antepartum stillbirth in a second pregnancy (pooled hazard ratio&nbsp;1.40; 95%&nbsp;CI 1.10-1.77) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The analysis excluded the largest published study, which included almost 1.8 million singleton second births in women with no underlying medical conditions and fetuses with no structural or chromosomal abnormalities, and found no association between previous cesarean and future term fetal demise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. This study was excluded from the analysis because it included intrapartum stillbirths, which may have a different etiology. In this study, the fetal death rates at term in those with and without a previous cesarean delivery were 0.7 and 0.8 per 1000 births, respectively. In the entire cohort of over 11 million singleton births (second and subsequent births), the fetal death rates at term for women with and without a previous cesarean were 0.4 and 0.6 per 1000 births, respectively. An association between unexplained stillbirth and a prior cesarean delivery observed in some studies may be due to residual confounding.

In one of the largest series, composite severe maternal morbidity after planned primary cesarean for breech presentation (over 46,000 women) and planned vaginal delivery (over two million women) was 27.3 and 9.0 per 1000 deliveries, respectively (odds ratio [OR] 3.1, 95% CI 3.0-3.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

Similarly, a retrospective cohort study including over 16,000 nulliparous women who underwent cesarean delivery on maternal request observed no difference in serious maternal morbidity between this group and women who underwent planned vaginal delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Contemporary standards for infection and thromboembolism prophylaxis in women undergoing cesarean should result in a reduction in these morbidities and further narrow any difference in morbidity between cesarean and vaginal birth; however, contemporary data from randomized trials are not available. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3576376102\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term complications of abdominal surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Formation of adhesions is common after cesarean delivery, and the extent and density increase with increasing numbers of repeat cesarean deliveries: The reported prevalence of adhesions is 12 to 46 percent of women at their second cesarean and 26 to 75 percent of women at their third cesarean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/58-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-62</a>]. The rate of bowel obstruction after cesarean delivery is much lower, ranging from 0.5 to 9 per 1000 cesarean deliveries, with the highest risk in women who have undergone multiple cesarean deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>].</p><p>Adhesions also increase the difficulty of future intra-abdominal surgical procedures, and may increase the risk of bladder or bowel injury during surgery.

In addition, a systematic review reported that children delivered by cesarean were at increased risk of asthma up to the age of 12 years (3.8 versus 3.1 percent; OR 1.21, 1.11 to 1.32; n = 887,960; 13 studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. </p><p>Respiratory problems are more frequent after cesarean delivery without labor because mechanisms for reabsorbing lung fluid are not fully activated and, sometimes, as a result of iatrogenic prematurity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/71-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-74</a>].

All United States live births and infant deaths from 1999 to 2002 (8,026,415 births and 17,412 infant deaths) were examined. Low-risk births were defined as singleton, term, vertex births with no medical risk factors, placenta previa, or prior cesarean delivery noted on the birth certificate. The &quot;planned vaginal delivery&quot; group consisted of vaginal births and those cesareans performed in the setting of labor complications or procedures (n = 7,755,236), while the &quot;planned cesarean delivery&quot; group comprised women who underwent cesareans with no documented labor complications or procedures (n = 271,179). After adjustment for maternal age, <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity,</span> education, parity, smoking, infant birth weight, gestational age, and exclusion of infants with congenital anomalies, the odds of neonatal death with &quot;planned cesarean delivery&quot; were significantly higher than with &quot;planned vaginal delivery&quot; (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.67-2.24). The accuracy of these findings is limited by (1) reliance on birth certificate data, which can be inaccurate and incomplete, (2) the absence of data on the indication for cesarean, and (3) the absence of information on the causes of neonatal death.</p><p>A subsequent retrospective cohort study of 56,549 late-preterm and term deliveries from Geneva, Switzerland also reported an increase in neonatal mortality and clinically relevant morbidities (neonatal intensive care unit admission, respiratory problems) in term births by elective cesarean delivery compared with planned vaginal delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. The authors speculated that a policy of restricted indications for elective cesarean delivery possibly selected pregnancies with higher neonatal risk and thus may have led to an overestimation of unfavorable outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3515938276\"><span class=\"h2\">Other possibly increased adverse neonatal effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Theoretic concerns of planned cesarean delivery include risks to offspring from not experiencing labor-related stress and immune activation, lack of exposure to maternal vulvovaginal flora, and potential epigenetic changes related to mode of delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/78-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-80</a>].

There are few data specifically addressing the maternal death rate for cesarean delivery on maternal request. The lack of data is due, in large part, to the absence of well-designed clinical trials, failure to analyze existing data by intent (eg, classifying women in the vaginal delivery group if they undergo emergency cesarean in the course of planned vaginal delivery), and the rarity of maternal death in resource-rich countries.</p><p>It is likely that the risk of maternal death from maternal request cesarean delivery is similar to that with scheduled repeat cesarean delivery prior to the onset of labor. This risk ranges from 1 in 5000 cesarean deliveries to fewer than 1 in 70,000 cesarean deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/83-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-86</a>].</p><p>If cesarean is more dangerous than vaginal delivery, then one would expect a higher maternal mortality rate among populations with high cesarean delivery rates, but this association has not been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/83,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,87</a>]. In fact, using national estimates of cesarean delivery rates after 1990 in 19 Latin American countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>], one study found that the highest maternal mortality was in populations in which the cesarean delivery rate was lowest.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As with any medical procedure, the risks and benefits of cesarean delivery on maternal request need to be balanced with the risks and benefits of a planned vaginal delivery. Patient-specific issues that can affect the choice of delivery route include comorbid medical conditions, body mass index, future reproductive plans, prior childbirth experiences, outcome of previous surgical procedures, and the woman's personal philosophy about childbirth. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The best available evidence suggests that planned cesarean delivery is associated with a lower risk of fetal injury than planned vaginal delivery, but longer hospital <span class=\"nowrap\">stay/recovery</span> and increased risks of neonatal respiratory problems, abnormal placentation in future pregnancies, and uterine rupture in future pregnancies if a trial of labor is attempted. Planned cesarean delivery minimizes the risk of surgical complications associated with unplanned cesarean delivery, which may become necessary during attempted vaginal delivery. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Potential benefits of planned cesarean delivery'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Potential disadvantages and risks of planned cesarean delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Professional standards do not mandate discussing the option of cesarean delivery on maternal request with every patient, given the high degree of uncertainty about its clinical benefits and risks compared with vaginal birth. (See <a href=\"#H2993823068\" class=\"local\">'Ethical issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstetricians are not obliged ethically or professionally to perform cesarean delivery on maternal request; early referral to another health care practitioner willing to act in accordance with the patient's request is appropriate in such cases. (See <a href=\"#H2993823068\" class=\"local\">'Ethical issues'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinician should find out the reasons for the patient's request for cesarean delivery, address her concerns about labor and vaginal birth and any misinformation leading to those concerns, and engage her and possibly her support persons in a balanced discussion about the risks and benefits of the procedure over a series of visits. In particular, work and family pressures, personal fears and anxieties about childbirth, and concerns about pain should be addressed. (See <a href=\"#H2993823068\" class=\"local\">'Ethical issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women planning several pregnancies, we suggest avoiding cesarean delivery on maternal request (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Placenta previa and accreta are significantly more common in pregnancies following one or more cesarean deliveries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51302\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51302 \">table 1</a>). Moreover, these complications may necessitate cesarean hysterectomy. If the patient undergoes a trial of labor in the future, she will be at increased risk of uterine rupture.
