A meta-analysis of 29 studies showed that EUS had high specificity (90 percent) but only moderate sensitivity (73 percent) for detecting vascular invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-the-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Analyses have also shown that both sensitivity and specificity have decreased over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-the-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. When comparing the time period of 1988 to 1994 with the period of 2000 to 2005, the pooled sensitivity decreased from 90 to 65 percent, and the pooled specificity decreased from 96 to 86 percent.

However, the studies are heterogeneous, and most had methodologic flaws.</p><p>These limitations were highlighted in a systematic review that examined 11 studies with 678 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-the-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Only three studies met all but one of the quality criteria. The most important and frequent study limitations were lack of a consecutive series of patients and biased patient selection for surgery that potentially affected validity. The older studies included in that review suggested that EUS was superior to CT for staging and determining vascular invasion. However, the more recent studies found that helical CT was more accurate than EUS for T-staging (73 versus 63 percent) and was equivalent for N-staging (62 to 63 percent versus 65 to 69 percent). EUS and CT were also equivalent with regard to detecting vascular invasion.

MDR-CT has improved the evaluation of the main pancreatic duct and the detection of small tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-the-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Only a few studies comparing EUS with MDR-CT for detecting and staging pancreatic cancer are available. In a report of 80 patients who underwent EUS for pancreatic cancer, EUS was superior to MDR-CT for tumor detection (sensitivity 98 versus 86 percent) and primary T-staging (accuracy 67 versus 41 percent), but similar for nodal staging (accuracy 44 versus 47 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-the-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Fifty-three patients underwent surgery and 25 were found to have resectable tumors. EUS and MDR-CT correctly identified 88 and 92 percent of the resectable tumors. Of the 28 surgical patients with unresectable tumors, EUS and MDR-CT correctly identified the tumors as being unresectable in 68 and 64 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of studies have compared the accuracy of EUS and angiography for determining vascular invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-the-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/10,20,25,27,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,20,25,27,35</a>]. Although the results vary, EUS appears to be as accurate or more accurate for determining vascular invasion, except for tumors that invade the superior mesenteric vein. The following examples illustrate these points:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study included 45 patients with pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-the-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Several EUS criteria for vascular invasion were studied, the most accurate of which was the presence of an irregular venous wall (accuracy 87 percent). However, the sensitivity of wall irregularity for detecting vascular invasion was only 47 percent, due in large part to difficulty in detecting invasion of the superior mesenteric vein (sensitivity of 17 percent). In 28 patients who underwent surgical exploration, negative resection margins were attained in 86 percent when both tests were used preoperatively, 78 percent when EUS was used without angiography, and 60 percent when only angiography was used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher sensitivities were noted in a report of 21 patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent EUS and angiography prior to an attempt at curative resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-the-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

The tumor was resectable in 36 patients (57 percent). The sensitivities of EUS and MRI for determining resectability were 61 and 73 percent, respectively. EUS and MRI both predicted resectability in 18 patients, of whom 16 (89 percent) were found to be resectable at the time of surgery. Both studies predicted unresectability in 17 patients, of whom 13 (76 percent) were unresectable at the time of surgery.</p><p>In a prospective study of 48 patients who were staged with EUS and MRI prior to surgery, the correlation between EUS and MRI was fair (kappa 0.42), with agreement in the patient's staging seen in 74 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-the-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

In that study, when using strict cytologic criteria, the sensitivity for EUS-guided FNA diagnosing pancreatic adenocarcinoma was 77 percent, with a specificity of 99 percent.
