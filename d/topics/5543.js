Historically, DGI occurred more frequently in females than males; however, that sex ratio may be reversing, with increases in gonococcal infection in general among males, and because DGI might be more common among HIV-infected individuals (of whom males comprise the majority in North America and Western Europe) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/1,4-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4-11</a>].</p><p>DGI is considered a common cause of acute polyarthralgias, polyarthritis, or oligoarthritis in young, otherwise healthy patients. Although <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>is the most common cause of monomicrobial septic arthritis overall, among sexually active adults, <em>N. gonorrhoeae </em>is the most common causative organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Nevertheless, the overall proportion of septic arthritis cases that are due to <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> is low. In case studies from Europe during the 1990s, <em>N. gonorrhoeae </em>was the causative organism in 1.7 percent in a series from France [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], 0.6 percent in a series from the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and 0 percent from a three-year prospective community-based study in the Netherlands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a retrospective study of 34 cases of musculoskeletal infections among intravenous drug users in Spain, <em>N. gonorrhoeae </em>was the causative agent in 2.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The prevalence of gonococcal arthritis may be higher in the United States than in the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Gonococcal arthritis appears to be more prevalent in more resource-limited settings, although there are limited epidemiologic studies from such regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND PREDISPOSING FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The probability that a localized gonococcal infection will spread to joints and other tissues depends upon specific host, microbial, and possibly immune factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Host factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A history of recent symptomatic genital infection is uncommon in men or women with disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI); asymptomatic mucosal infection is thought to increase the risk of dissemination due to delayed diagnosis, resulting in delays in antibiotic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/6,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,18</a>].

Transparent strains may be less sensitive to lysis by trypsin, less adherent to neutrophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], and may also be more adherent to fallopian tubes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Genital secretions during menses are more alkaline, which may facilitate gonococcal growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased concentrations of transferrin and heme at mucosal surfaces during menstruation may be used as a source of iron by <em>N. gonorrhoeae </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy or the immediate postpartum state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>] &ndash; The risk of DGI associated with pregnancy is postulated to result from normal immunological changes during pregnancy, such as alterations in cell-mediated immunity and increased vascularity, which may predispose to <em>N gonorrhoeae </em>invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital or acquired complement deficiencies (C5, C6, C7, or C8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/27,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29</a>] &ndash; Select complement deficiencies predispose to DGI as a result of decreased complement-mediated killing of <em>N. gonorrhoeae; </em>up to 50 percent of patients with C6, C7, or C8 complement deficiencies may develop bacteremia with pathogenic <em>Neisseria</em> species<em> </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]<em>. </em>One study found that as many as 13 percent of patients with DGI have a complement deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Complement deficiencies also predispose to recurrent, and perhaps subacute or even chronic infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) &ndash; SLE may predispose to DGI; however, conflicting reports exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Mechanisms that could potentially explain an association between SLE and DGI include complement depletion as a result of immune complex deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], a possible association between SLE and inherited complement deficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], and use of immunosuppressive medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Given that the range of symptoms seen with DGI and SLE flares overlap, a high index of suspicion for DGI is warranted in patients with SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1863085819\" class=\"local\">'Clinical suspicion'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Eculizumab</a> &ndash; Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody to C5 that is used in certain conditions, such as complement-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome, and has been associated with severe meningococcal infections. Theoretically, eculizumab could also increase the risk of DGI given the risk with other acquired complement deficiencies. Nevertheless, there have only been rare reports of DGI among patients treated with eculizumab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Data from larger studies are lacking. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Microbial factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> contain a variety of virulence and growth factors associated with an increased propensity to cause DGI:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Porins</strong> &ndash; Porins are outer membrane structures. Porin B isoform 1A (PorB<sub>1a</sub>) differs from the other existing isoform (PorB<sub>1b</sub>), and the presence of PorB<sub>1a</sub> has been associated with increased serum resistance and a capacity to cause DGI under low-phosphate conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. The exchange of arginine for histidine at locus 92 is highly conserved among PorB<sub>1a</sub> isolates, and not among PorB<sub>1b</sub> isolates; PorB<sub>1b </sub>isolates thus have a serine residue with resulting loss of the invasive phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. A proposed mechanism for the increased invasive capacity of PorB<sub>1a</sub> involves regulatory complement factor H (fH) and C4 binding protein with preferential binding to strains expressing PorB<sub>1a</sub>, which correlates with an increased conversion of C3b to iC3b and, thus, decreased complement-mediated killing. Furthermore, fH binds sialylated lipopolysaccharide and is responsible for further inactivation of C3b and alternative pathway-mediated killing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/40,43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,43-45</a>]. Additional work has shown that <em>N. gonorrhoeae </em>invades epithelial cells via the scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cells (SREC-I) in a manner that is dependent on PorB<sub>1a</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. That invasion, and potentially a starting point for dissemination, is further dependent on membrane rafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Auxotype</strong> &ndash; Strains<strong> </strong>of <em>N. gonorrhoeae </em>requiring arginine, hypoxanthine, and uracil (AHU auxotype) have been associated with disseminated gonococcal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. That association may be due to increased resistance to complement-mediated killing, thus conferring serum resistance. Importantly, strains with that auxotype may be clonal, and thus with varying distributions across the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. Additionally, the PorB<sub>1a</sub> isoform is found in most strains with the AHU auxotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/39,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genetic island with virulence factors</strong> &ndash; A genetic island unique to <em>N. gonorrhoeae </em>has been described, which can exist in different forms. One form contains a gene known as <em>sac-4</em> and a peptidoglycan hydrolase gene (<em>atlA</em>). Isolates with genetic islands containing both <em>sac-4</em> and <em>atlA</em> have been found preferentially in strains that cause dissemination. It is thought that <em>sac-4</em> may augment the ability of <em>N. gonorrhoeae </em>to survive in the blood stream, and <em>atlA </em>may increase DNA exportation facilitating transformation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> may increase the level of cytotoxic peptidoglycan fragments, potentially augmenting the immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Notably, in that study, the presence of <em>sac-4</em> correlated with the AHU auxotype.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Colony opacity proteins </strong>&ndash; <em>N. gonorrhoeae </em>express colony opacity (OpaCEA) proteins, which bind to carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs), resulting in colony formation at mucosal surfaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. CEACAM-3 in particular, however, is expressed on human granulocytes and is responsible for uptake and subsequent destruction of <em>N. gonorrhoeae </em>organisms expressing OpaCEA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. Analysis of <em>N. gonorrhoeae </em>isolated from patients with disseminated infection revealed expected CEACAM binding, with the exception of CEACAM-3, indicating another potential source for immune evasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Similarly, another study found that transmigration of the epithelial cell layer by <em>N. gonorrhoeae </em>was limited by Opa protein expression, and that bacteria without Opa proteins expressed were able to invade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lipid A</strong> &ndash; Lipid A is a component of lipooligosaccharide (LOS), a potent stimulator of the hosts immune response; the addition of phosphoethanolamine to lipid A is associated with resistance to innate host serum defenses and to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymyxin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polymyxin B</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pili variation </strong>&ndash; Pili are filamentous structures on the surface of <em>Neisseria </em>species. Genetic variation among pili is important for immune evasion and may contribute to tissue tropism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. Pilin galactosyl transferase (<em>pgtA</em>) can have two forms, one with a poly-G tract, which can undergo phase variation, while the second type does not have poly-G tract and is expressed constitutively without any variation. According to one study, most uncomplicated infections lack the poly-G in <em>pgtA</em>. Isolates with a poly-G tract (ie, those that can undergo phase variation), have been associated with DGI (24 of 24) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The mechanism by which a phase-variable <em>pgtA </em>gene increases the propensity for dissemination may involve: 1) immune evasion by turning off expression of <em>pgtA</em>, thus reducing antigenic exposure to serum antibodies; 2) increased molecular mimicry of variable <em>pgtA </em>proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]; and 3) microcolony destabilization of local infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Importantly, a subsequent study in a larger, more diverse population was unable to reproduce those findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], thus making the role of <em>pgtA </em>on <em>N. gonorrhoeae </em>dissemination uncertain. Work on porins has postulated that loss of microcolony stabilizing pili via phase variation may favor invasion in a PorB<sub>1a </sub>&ndash; SREC-I-dependent manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immunopathogenesis of DGI is uncertain. The hypothesis that inflammation rather than direct microbial invasion causes the clinical findings of DGI is supported by the frequent lack of <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> growth from blood, skin, and synovial fluid cultures during disseminated infection (see <a href=\"#H1071546224\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory and microbiologic testing'</a> below). Fastidious growth requirements of&nbsp;<em>N. gonorrhoeae </em>could explain the sterile cultures, and more sensitive testing methods (such as immunofluorescence or molecular techniques) have identified organisms in synovial and skin samples that were culture negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/65-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-69</a>]. Nevertheless, persistent synovitis in DGI can occur in culture and PCR-negative joints, and organisms can often be cultured from the genitourinary tract or other local sites in most cases of DGI, despite negative cultures elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. Thus, the sterile synovitis, tenosynovitis, and dermatitis associated with DGI may not always require viable&nbsp;<em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>, and other inflammatory mechanisms may be important.</p><p>Immune complex deposition may play a role; however, studies attempting to identify immune complexes among patients with DGI report conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74</a>]. The observation that <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> cell wall components can induce inflammation and arthritis in animal studies also supports an immune component to DGI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Components of the cell wall and membrane stimulate the immune response and may remain as soluble factors that perpetuate inflammatory mediators with the potential to combat the infection and damage protective mucosal, perhaps facilitating bacterial invasion and dissemination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2174139947\"><span class=\"h2\">Spectrum of findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) report feeling well up to the onset of the illness.

Most patients who develop suppurative arthritis have not had preceding polyarthralgia or skin lesions, although patients with the polyarthralgia syndrome can develop purulent arthritis later in the disease course if not recognized and treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The pathogenic mechanism responsible for the strikingly different clinical presentations is poorly understood, although it may in part depend upon differences in the infecting strain of the organism.</p><p>Patients with either of the above clinical syndromes usually do not simultaneously manifest signs and symptoms of a gonococcal infection involving mucous membranes, even though localized infection involving the urethra, cervix, rectum, or pharynx typically precedes the onset of DGI. </p><p>Other manifestations, such as endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>], myopericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>], meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/26,81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,81,82</a>], osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>], and occasionally abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>] and vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>], can also occur.

It is common to find between 2 and 10 lesions in an individual patient; there are rarely more than 40 lesions. They typically occur on the distal extremities and are rarely present on the face [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Pustular or vesicular skin lesions are often transient and often last for only three to four days, even without treatment.

Axial involvement is rare, although cases with glenohumeral joint and sternoclavicular joint involvement have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/25,83,89-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,83,89-93</a>]. Polyarthritis, when present, is typically asymmetric. Most patients are afebrile. </p><p>As noted above, a small number of patients with purulent arthritis may also have tenosynovitis or skin lesions.

A low threshold for suspicion is important since not all patients will report sexual activity, and DGI has been reported in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>], whom providers may assume not to be sexually active. </p><p>Accompanying skin lesions, particularly pustular or vesiculopustular <span class=\"nowrap\">lesions,&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;tenosynovitis</span> (tenderness along the flexor sheath or pain with passive extension) should heighten suspicion for DGI. </p><p>Given that the range of symptoms seen with DGI and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flares overlap and that some reports suggest an increased risk of DGI among patients with SLE, a high index of suspicion for DGI is warranted in patients with SLE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients suspected of having DGI should undergo a complete history and physical examination. In addition to evaluating for the typical clinical manifestations of joint involvement with or without skin findings discussed above (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above), a thorough sexual history should be performed. Most patients with DGI have a history of recent sexual activity, although this may not be elicited in all, which highlights the importance of patient-provider trust. Furthermore, only a minority of patients report having recently had a sexually transmitted infection (STI), but some may report a more remote STI diagnosis. Among women, the timing of the last menstrual period and the possibility of pregnancy should be assessed. </p><p>A careful physical examination is often needed to detect the characteristic skin lesions of DGI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F59399\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59399 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F69978\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69978 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71303\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71303 \">picture 3</a>). Typical lesions may be mistakenly dismissed as unimportant furuncles or pimples by the patient or clinician.

It is not unusual to see patients with only one or two joints that are involved. Small or large joints may be affected, and symmetric joint involvement is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Tenosynovitis is often visible to the examining clinician, with redness and warmth along the tendon sheath. Its presence can usually be confirmed by eliciting pain along the tendon sheath with active or passive joint movement.</p><p>In addition, signs suggestive of rare DGI complications, such as meningitis or endocarditis should be sought, with further testing (eg, lumbar puncture or echocardiography) in patients with concerning findings on exam.

Cultures are diagnostic when positive and are also helpful in separating DGI from other conditions, such as septic arthritis due to&nbsp;<em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>S. aureus</em>, both of which may mimic the clinical features of DGI. The reported rate of blood culture positivity in various series ranges from 4 to 70 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/4,18,95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,18,95,96</a>]. Patients with the tenosynovitis, dermatitis, and polyarthralgia form of DGI may be more likely to have positive blood cultures, as such symptoms may reflect an earlier, bacteremic stage of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/18,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,96</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Specimens from mucosal sites</strong> &ndash; Patients with the clinical features of DGI should have urogenital, rectal, and pharyngeal specimens submitted for microbiologic testing for&nbsp;<em>N. gonorrhoeae. </em>Often, patients with DGI have evidence of infection at urogenital, rectal, or pharyngeal sites despite lack of symptoms at those sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/4,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,23</a>]. If available and validated for the specific specimen, nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is the preferred diagnostic test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. If NAAT methods are not available, culture is the preferred alternative test; specimens submitted for culture should be processed on Thayer-Martin media. The optimal urogenital specimen depends on the type of testing performed. Urine (for men) and self-collected vaginal swabs (for women) are the preferred specimens for NAAT, and urethral and cervical swabs are the preferred specimens for culture.

Synovial fluid is generally sent for cell count, differential, Gram stain, and bacterial culture, and the laboratory should be alerted that gonococcal infection is a consideration so that the specimen can be processed and plated appropriately. For those with purulent arthritis, cultures for&nbsp;<em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>&nbsp;may only be positive in approximately 50 percent of cases or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/4,18,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,18,95</a>]. Cultures are even less likely to be positive for those who present with the tenosynovitis, dermatitis, and polyarthralgia, even if synovial fluid can be obtained. NAAT appears more sensitive than culture of synovial fluid in patients with gonococcal arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>], and should also be performed if available. However, in certain settings, even if available for other specimens, NAAT may not be verified for use on synovial fluid. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The mean synovial fluid leukocyte count in septic arthritis is typically around <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000&nbsp;cells/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>]; in some cases of gonococcal arthritis, however, lower counts can be observed (approximately 20,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76506\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76506 \">table 2</a>). Chemistry studies of the joint fluid, such as the concentrations of glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), or protein, have only limited value; a reduction in glucose concentration and elevation of LDH are consistent with a bacterial infection but are not diagnostic or particularly sensitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].

Many associated skin lesions are not amenable to drainage and sampling. If pustular skin lesions are present, specimens from these lesions can be sent for Gram stain and gonococcal culture, but the yield of these is often low, with a 10 percent culture positivity rate in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-gonococcal-infection/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].

Those infections may present with monoarthritis or oligoarthritis, fever, and chills. Identification of an organism on bacterial culture of synovial fluid should distinguish those infections from DGI.

However, the associated rash is typically urticarial, and synovial fluid analysis usually shows noninflammatory fluid. Furthermore, the arthritis associated with HBV is more often polyarticular and symmetric. In addition to these clinical features, patients with HBV infection can usually be distinguished from those with DGI by the presence of elevated serum aminotransaminases and evidence of acute HBV infection on serologic testing.

However, the rash of acute rheumatic fever is quite rarely seen, and if observed, it is usually transient and virtually never pustular or vesiculopustular. The diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever is based upon a constellation of findings that include microbiologic or serologic evidence of a recent streptococcal infection and the presence of carditis or neurologic symptoms. Most patients with poststreptococcal arthritis have a characteristically rapid response to salicylates or other anti-inflammatory drugs.

In particular, DGI might be suspected in patients with the constellation of reactive arthritis, tenosynovitis, and urethritis, but unlike with typical DGI, such patients also often have one or more of the following: conjunctivitis, circinate balanitis, or keratoderma blenorrhagicum. Clinical and radiologic evidence of sacroiliitis is also very suggestive of reactive arthritis or spondyloarthritis. In addition, a therapeutic trial of antibiotics can help to differentiate between those disorders. Patients with reactive arthritis characteristically do not respond to treatment for <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>, whereas response to treatment in DGI is usually rapid and unequivocal.

The precise duration of treatment depends on the overall health status of the patient, including the presence of an immunocompromising condition and the rate of response to therapy. A longer duration of therapy is appropriate for those with comorbidities or slow rate of response. </p><p>Patients with purulent arthritis should generally also undergo joint drainage. That can be accomplished either with repeated needle aspirations or arthroscopically.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with DGI usually present with one of two syndromes: purulent arthritis alone or a triad of tenosynovitis, dermatitis, and polyarthralgias without frank arthritis. Patients with the syndrome of polyarthralgias often have systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, and malaise. Those with purulent arthritis alone usually have involvement of the knees, wrists, or ankles without any systemic symptoms. When present, polyarthritis is typically asymmetric. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The possibility of DGI should be considered in individuals (particularly those younger than 40 years or sexually active with multiple partners) who present with acute polyarthralgias, polyarthritis, or joint pain concerning for septic arthritis. Accompanying skin lesions, particularly pustular or vesiculopustular lesions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tenosynovitis (tenderness along the tendon sheath or pain with passive or active joint movement), should heighten suspicion for DGI. Most patients do not have a recent history of urogenital gonorrhea. (See <a href=\"#H1863085819\" class=\"local\">'Clinical suspicion'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'History and physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with clinical features of DGI should have blood cultures performed and synovial, skin, rectal, pharyngeal, and urethral or cervical specimens submitted for microbiological testing. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are the preferred diagnostic tests for mucosal specimens (urogenital, rectal, and pharyngeal) and may be more sensitive than culture on synovial fluid, but they may not be universally available. Specimens submitted for gonococcal culture should be processed on specific (Thayer-Martin) media. (See <a href=\"#H1071546224\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory and microbiologic testing'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is made by identification of <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> (either through molecular testing or culture) in a nonmucosal site (blood, synovial fluid, skin). If microbiologic tests are positive only at mucosal sites, the diagnosis is also made if the clinical presentation is consistent with disseminated infection. If all microbiologic tests are negative, the diagnosis is assumed based on a consistent clinical presentation and response to appropriate therapy. All patients with DGI should be tested for HIV infection, syphilis, and chlamydia. (See <a href=\"#H4225310951\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4007538143\" class=\"local\">'Screening for other sexually transmitted infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For initial therapy of DGI, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> (1 gram intravenously [or, if needed, intramuscularly] every 24 hours) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> (1 gram orally in a single dose) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Doxycycline</a> (100 mg twice a day for seven days) is an alternate second agent to use with ceftriaxone. For patients without septic arthritis, treatment is generally continued for seven days; once clinical improvement has occurred, the course can be completed either with a lower dose of ceftriaxone (250 mg intramuscularly daily) or, if susceptibility testing was performed, with an active oral agent. Patients with septic arthritis usually require ceftriaxone for 7 to 14 days along with joint drainage. (See <a href=\"#H223292\" class=\"local\">'Initial antimicrobial therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3592023542\" class=\"local\">'Definitive therapy and duration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The above treatment regimens for gonococcal infections are also effective against <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>, a frequent copathogen with <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of Chlamydia coinfection'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection#H5623067\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection&quot;, section on 'First-line agents'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All sex partners within the past 60 days of patients with DGI should be notified and offered treatment for both gonococcal and chlamydial infections.
