Severely immunocompromised patients include individuals with active leukemia or lymphoma, generalized malignancy, aplastic anemia, graft-versus-host disease, HIV with CD4 count &lt;200, congenital immunodeficiency, current or recent radiation therapy, solid organ transplant within a year, or bone marrow transplant within two years, or individuals whose transplants occurred &gt;2 years ago but who are still taking immunosuppressive drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Moderately immunocompromised patients include asplenic individuals and individuals with renal failure, chronic liver disease, diabetes, or HIV with CD4 count &gt;200. Perhaps the largest growing population of immunocompromised hosts is those on biologic therapy and other immunomodulatory treatments for autoimmune and other chronic inflammatory diseases who have a broad range of immunosuppression. The overall risk for travel-related (and other) infections must be considered on an individual basis.</p><p>Immunocompromised hosts traveling overseas are at risk for exposure to endemic pathogens. In general, the vaccine response rate in these patients is diminished and they may be more likely to have adverse effects from vaccines containing live attenuated virus.</p><p>Issues related to travel-related vaccines in adult immunocompromised hosts without HIV will be reviewed here. Issues related to travel-related vaccines in immunocompetent hosts are discussed separately, as are issues related to routine immunizations for these groups. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-for-travel\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations for travel&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in hematopoietic cell transplant candidates and recipients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-adults-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in adults with cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in solid organ transplant candidates and recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunocompromised hosts planning to travel overseas should be evaluated by a travel medicine specialist familiar with the patient's immunocompromised state and medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. Travel health specialists for complex patients should confer with the traveler's other providers as needed to develop an appropriate plan. Given the broad spectrum of immune compromise, an assessment of risk is an important part of the pretravel visit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56079\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56079 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. Some immunocompromised hosts may wish to defer travel until they are less immunocompromised (eg, delay until one year after solid organ transplant or two years after hematopoietic stem cell transplant).</p><p>Vaccination should be initiated several months prior to travel when possible to allow time for serologic testing and additional boosters if needed. Ideally, immunocompromised hosts should be vaccinated during periods of minimal or no exogenous immunosuppression to optimize the immunologic response (eg, before solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant, before biologic immunomodulators are given, etc) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Vaccination is least effective in the initial months after solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant since this is usually the period of highest immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in solid organ transplant candidates and recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Timing of vaccination for patients on chronic immunosuppression is poorly studied; the clinician must weigh the benefits of reducing or suspending the immunosuppressive regimen with the risk of disease flare, rejection, and the subsequent potential need for more potent immunosuppression. Worsening of disease while traveling could become a medical emergency, requiring careful planning.</p><p>In general, a fourfold increase in antibody titer (or titer above a designated threshold) is considered evidence of seroconversion. Immunocompromised hosts are less likely to have a significant immunologic response, although they may benefit from partial protection.</p><p>Immune responses to vaccination may wane more rapidly in immunocompromised individuals than other hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Booster doses of vaccine may be administered in the setting of low or undetectable antibody titers, although the efficacy for this has not been demonstrated.</p><p>The response to vaccination can be variable. Among 292 allogeneic transplant recipients, 89 percent of those who failed to mount a response to the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine mounted a &ge;threefold rise in polio titers following three doses of inactivated poliovirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Studies on the efficacy or seroconversion following most travel vaccines in immunocompromised hosts have not been performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ROUTINE VACCINES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Travel advice encounters provide the opportunity to review routine immunizations that may have been overlooked. Information on routine vaccinations in immunocompromised hosts is summarized in the Tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66152\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66152 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91882\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91882 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62130\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62130 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82634\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82634 \">figure 2</a>) and discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in solid organ transplant candidates and recipients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in hematopoietic cell transplant candidates and recipients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-adults-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in adults with cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Tetanus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tetanus boosters should be up to date before traveling. Tetanus is rare in the industrialized world where vaccination rates are quite good; the prevalence is much higher in resource-limited settings, although it is rare among travelers. Vaccination is appropriate for travelers to regions where tetanus is endemic who were vaccinated more than 10 years previously. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tetanus-diphtheria toxoid vaccination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Diphtheria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diphtheria is common in resource-limited settings. Vaccination is appropriate for travelers to regions where diphtheria is endemic who were vaccinated more than 10 years previously or whose titers are below &gt;0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL</span>. In practice, boosters are frequently given without checking titers. Diphtheria antibody levels could be measured &ge;4 weeks after vaccination for immunocompromised travelers traveling to endemic areas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tetanus-diphtheria toxoid vaccination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pertussis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Booster vaccination for pertussis is warranted for previously vaccinated adults. Acellular Tdap vaccines have been formulated for adults with reduced quantities of the diphtheria and pertussis to reduce side effects (available as Boostrix or ADACEL). Thus far, this vaccine has not been studied in immunocompromised hosts but may be used in the setting of exposure risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pertussis infection in adolescents and adults: Treatment and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Influenza</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaccination against influenza should occur annually in most immunocompromised hosts; exceptions include those who underwent transplantation, treatment for rejection, or other profound immunosuppression in the few months prior to vaccination. Influenza immunity wanes and it is not known whether immunocompromised travelers should be given booster vaccines prior to travel, although it may be reasonable in certain higher risk settings. Given the year-round influenza activity in the tropics, in general, standard practice is to revaccinate with inactivated vaccine prior to travel if it has been more than 12 months since the last influenza vaccine. The approach to influenza vaccination in immunocompromised hosts is discussed further separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults#H775072633\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza vaccination in adults&quot;, section on 'Immunocompromised hosts'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Pneumococcus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pneumococcal vaccine should be given to immunocompromised hosts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86782\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86782 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Adults (aged &ge;19 years) with immunocompromising conditions who have not previously received PCV13 or PPSV23 should receive a single dose of PCV13 followed by a dose of PPSV23 at least eight weeks later. Those who have previously received &ge;1 dose of PPSV23 should receive a dose of PCV13 &ge;1 year after the last PPSV23 dose was given. For adults who require additional doses of PPSV23, the first should be given no sooner than eight weeks after PCV13 and at least five years after the most recent dose of PPSV23. In immunocompromised patients, a second dose of PPSV23 five years after the initial dose is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumococcal vaccination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Measles, mumps, and rubella</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) in the United States is usually performed with a trivalent live virus vaccine (MMR vaccine). Primary and acquired immunodeficiency states are contraindications to MMR vaccination, including patients who are immunosuppressed with human immunodeficiency virus, cellular immune deficiencies, hypogammaglobulinemic and dysgammaglobulinemic states, or who are on immunosuppressive therapy, including biologic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/1,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14-16</a>]. Measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE), pneumonitis, and death as a direct consequence of disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported in immunocompromised individuals inadvertently vaccinated with measles-containing vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>MMR vaccine may be administered to patients with asplenia, renal failure, chronic liver disease, and diabetes but not to those with more severe immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Prior to travel to endemic areas, serologic evidence of immunity against measles, mumps, and rubella should be evaluated in transplant recipients. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Immune globulin</a> should be considered for seronegative immunosuppressed travelers to areas where measles is endemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measles-mumps-and-rubella-immunization-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measles, mumps, and rubella immunization in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Immunocompromised hosts with hypogammaglobulinemia or other medical conditions and who routinely receive intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) do not need additional gamma globulin protection for measles, varicella, or hepatitis A, as the IVIG is likely to provide much higher titer protection than gamma globulin. Vaccination against hepatitis A should still be performed for longer term protection (albeit a lower peak serologic titer and shorter duration of protection will be achieved than in normal hosts).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatitis B</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunization against hepatitis B is appropriate for certain immunocompromised hosts including hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients (given their exposure to blood products), diabetics, those who will have new sexual partners while traveling, those living in endemic areas for extended periods, or those who are likely to need transfusions or medical procedures while traveling.</p><p>The efficacy of standard hepatitis B vaccination is reduced when the vaccine is administered following transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/14,15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,18</a>]. Response rates appear to be adversely affected by age &ge;18 years and history of prior chronic graft-versus-host disease but not by donor type, T-cell depletion, adoptive immunotherapy, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The serologic response rate can sometimes be improved by administering extra doses of vaccine. Some favor the following regimen for immunocompromised hosts: immunization with a vaccine containing 40 mcg of hepatitis B surface antigen (ie, two 1 mL Engerix-B vaccines, each containing 20 mcg, or a special formulation of Recombivax-HB) at one site, in a three- or four-dose schedule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/1,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,19</a>]. A single higher dose vaccine may provide some protection for those who are nonimmune and vaccinated close to the time of departure (with a plan for follow-up vaccination after travel). Intradermal vaccination may be considered for nonresponders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Varicella</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic evidence of immunity against varicella should be evaluated in transplant recipients prior to travel to endemic areas. In general, the attenuated live Oka strain vaccine formulations for varicella should not be used in immunocompromised hosts until there are more data regarding their safety. The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varicella vaccine</a> may be administered to individuals with asplenia, renal failure, chronic liver disease, and diabetes but not to those with more severe immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Similarly, zoster vaccine should be avoided in more immunocompromised hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measles-mumps-and-rubella-immunization-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measles, mumps, and rubella immunization in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Immune globulin</a> or antiviral prophylaxis should be considered for seronegative, severely immunosuppressed travelers to areas where varicella is endemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Immunocompromised hosts with hypogammaglobulinemia who receive routine IVIG do not need additional antibody protection for varicella, measles, or hepatitis A.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TRAVEL VACCINES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatitis A</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatitis A can be a devastating illness in immunocompromised hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These patients have attenuated immunologic response and shortened durability of response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-a-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hepatitis A vaccine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Seroconversion rates to vaccination may depend on immunosuppressive medications, medical comorbidities, and type of vaccine used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. In one series including 39 liver and 39 renal transplant recipients who received two doses of hepatitis A vaccine six months apart, response rates among liver transplant recipients were 41 and 97 percent, and response rates among renal transplant recipients were 24 and 72 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Similar results were found in 53 patient with rheumatoid arthritis on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha treatment; at one and six months after the first dose, 10 and 33 percent had attained seroprotection, and, at one and six months after the second dose, 83 and 72 percent were seroprotected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Thus, vaccination with two doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-a-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hepatitis A vaccine</a> 6 to 12 months apart may be most protective for immunocompromised hosts who are on a modest immunosuppressive regimen, if there is enough time before travel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Titers may be checked to document seroconversion, although there is often insufficient time to document seroconversion prior to travel.</p><p>Intramuscular gamma globulin (consisting of pooled immunoglobulins) is 85 to 90 percent protective against hepatitis A infection; this effect lasts for three to six months, depending on the dose given. Immunocompromised hosts with hypogammaglobulinemia who receive routine intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) do not need additional antibody protection for hepatitis A, measles, or varicella.</p><p>Moderately to significantly immunosuppressed hosts who do not have sufficient time for immunization prior to travel or do not respond to immunization can be given intramuscular immunoglobulin prior to travel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For less immunocompromised hosts, vaccination alone may be adequate.

Immunocompromised individuals may have severe complications during infection with <em>Salmonella enterica</em> serovar <em>Typhi </em>and should be immunized against typhoid prior to travel to endemic areas.</p><p>There are two vaccines available: TyphimVi (Aventis Pasteur SA), an injectable polysaccharide vaccine, and Vivotif (Ty21a, Berna) an oral live attenuated vaccine. Both are generally well tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The inactive parenteral vaccine is recommended for immunocompromised individuals, as the oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=typhoid-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">typhoid vaccine</a> is a live vaccine that could theoretically cause disseminated disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The immune response in immunocompromised hosts to either vaccine is usually poor and efficacy in immunocompromised hosts is unknown.

Outbreaks of vaccine-associated poliomyelitis occasionally occur due to reversion of live attenuated poliovirus from the oral polio vaccine. Such outbreaks have occurred in Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), the Philippines, Madagascar, and Cape Verde.</p><p>Two forms of polio vaccine are available: the orally administered, live attenuated virus (OPV or Sabin) and the injected inactivated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poliovirus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">poliovirus vaccine</a> (IPV or Salk). Immunocompromised hosts and household contacts of immunocompromised individuals should not receive OPV, since attenuated vaccine strain polioviruses may spread through fecal-oral contact. OPV is no longer distributed in many countries, including the United States and Canada.</p><p>In general, travelers should have received a primary series of polio vaccine during childhood and at least one booster as an adult. Some authorities recommend booster immunization if more than ten years have elapsed since administration of the last polio vaccine, especially for individuals traveling to areas of the world with circulating wild-type polio viruses or a polio outbreak. In certain regions with active transmission of wild poliovirus, travelers should travel with an official certificate of vaccination that records their polio vaccination status within 4 to 52 weeks (such as the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis).</p><p>Poliovirus immunity is relatively well maintained after revaccination among patients with allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT). In a study of 134 patients who received three doses of inactivated polio vaccine beginning 12 months after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the estimated probabilities of remaining immune to poliovirus at 5 and 10 years after vaccination were 94 and 94 percent for subtype 1, 98 and 94 percent for subtype 2, and 93 and 90 percent for subtype 3, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

The meningococcal vaccine is indicated for individuals traveling to areas of the world with known outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease, to the meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa (especially during the dry winter months of December through June), and to Saudi Arabia for the Muslim pilgrimages of Hajj or Umrah, where proof of vaccination is required.</p><p>Immunocompromised hosts are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality from meningococcal disease; vaccination is appropriate for those with exposure risk. In the United States a quadrivalent polysaccharide (<em>Neisseria meningitidis </em>A, C, Y, W-135) vaccine and a newer protein conjugate vaccine are available. Two doses of vaccine are recommended for immunocompromised hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The lack of coverage for serogroup B in the routine vaccine remains problematic, although Trumenba (Serogroup B Meningococcal Vaccine) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prevent invasive meningococcal disease caused by <em>N. meningitidis</em> serogroup B in individuals 10 through 25 years of age. Similar vaccines are available in other regions. Persons who previously were vaccinated at age &ge;7 years and are at prolonged increased risk (ie, asplenia, other immunocompromised states) should be revaccinated &le;5 years after their previous meningococcal vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Among 44 adult HSCT recipients randomized to receive polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine either 8 or 20 months after transplant, the majority had significant immune responses to serogroups A and C; these responses were lower in the former group (8 months) than the latter group (20 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice-for-immunocompromised-hosts/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The immune responses declined sharply over the first 6 to 12 months after vaccination, suggesting revaccination should be performed for those at risk of exposure to meningococcal infection.
