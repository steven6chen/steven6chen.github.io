It depends on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your sex organs &ndash; Boys' sex organs are the penis and testicles. Girls' sex organs are the breasts, uterus, vagina, and ovaries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F68075\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68075 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53704 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether you feel like a girl or a boy, or somewhere in between</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which sex, or sexes, you are attracted to &ndash; Heterosexual means being attracted to people of the opposite sex. Homosexual means being attracted to people of the same sex. Bisexual means being attracted to both sexes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8224911\"><span class=\"h1\">What is sexual development?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sexual development is another term for the changes in your body that happen as you grow up. These changes can start in the pre-teen years and continue until adulthood. Some changes happen in the body. For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In girls, the breasts grow bigger.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In boys, hair grows on the face.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In girls and boys, hair grows under the arms and in the genital area.</p><p/><p>Other changes involve the way you think and feel, and the way you feel about other people. As you develop, you will probably start to feel attracted to certain people and want to be close with them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8224918\"><span class=\"h1\">What is sex?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When people talk about sex, they are usually talking about vaginal intercourse. Vaginal intercourse is when a man puts his penis into a woman's vagina. But there are other types of sex acts, too. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Touching another person's body or genitals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using the mouth or tongue on another person's genitals &ndash; This is called oral sex.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting the penis or another object into another person's anus &ndash; This is called anal sex.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Touching your own genitals with your hand or another object &ndash; This is called masturbation.</p><p/><p>Before doing any of these, it's important to make sure that the person you are with agrees to what you are doing (if you are with another person).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8224925\"><span class=\"h1\">When is sex NOT OK?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sex is <strong>not</strong> OK if it is with someone who does not want to do it or is not sure about doing it. It's also not OK if someone is not able to say whether or not they want it. When a person forces sex on someone who does not want it or cannot say whether they want it, it is called rape. Rape is a serious crime that can lead to being arrested or put in jail.</p><p>It is also not OK for an adult to have sex with a teen. If an adult makes you do any type of sex act, tell a parent, doctor, or other adult whom you trust.</p><p>Some states have laws about teens and sex. In some states, it is against the law for teens under a certain age to have sex, even if they both want to.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8224932\"><span class=\"h1\">What is a sexually transmitted infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A sexually transmitted infection, or STI, is an infection that you can catch during sex. Some STIs include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV &ndash; HIV is a lifelong condition that affects the body's infection-fighting system. The last stage of HIV is called AIDS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human papillomavirus (HPV) &ndash; HPV doesn't usually cause symptoms at first, but it can lead to other problems. These include cervical cancer in women, cancer of the mouth and throat in men and women, and genital warts in men and women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chlamydia and gonorrhea &ndash; These don't always cause symptoms at first. But they can lead to long-term problems in women, such as severe pain and trouble getting pregnant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Herpes &ndash; This can cause blisters and open sores in the genital area.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trichomonas, or &quot;trich&quot; &ndash; This can cause genital itching and discharge.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis B or C &ndash; This can lead to long-term liver problems.</p><p/><p>In many cases, you can get an STI and not know it. That's because STIs often do not have any noticeable signs or symptoms. Even when they cause no symptoms, STIs can lead to serious problems. For example, STIs can lead to problems getting pregnant or increase the risk of certain kinds of cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8224939\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I protect myself from getting an STI?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only way to be sure you won't get an STI is by not having sex. If you do have sex, you can lower your chance of getting an STI by using a condom every time you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Another option for oral sex is a dental dam. This is a small piece of latex or plastic wrap that prevents contact with body fluids.</p><p>People who use condoms can still get STIs, though. That's because condoms do not cover all of the skin that comes in contact with another person. Some infections can spread just from skin to skin contact. Plus, condoms can break or slip off. To help prevent this, be sure that the penis is completely hard before putting a condom on. Also, make sure that there is no air in the tip of the condom. Hold the tip closed as you roll the condom down over the penis. After ejaculation, the penis should be pulled out of the vagina or anus while it is still a little hard. When pulling out, hold the condom around the base of the penis to keep it from slipping off.</p><p>There are vaccines for 2 STIs &ndash; HPV and hepatitis B. Vaccines can prevent certain serious or deadly infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8224946\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I prevent pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only way to be sure you won't get pregnant is by not having vaginal intercourse. If you do have vaginal intercourse, you can lower your chance of getting pregnant by using birth control. There are different types of birth control that work in different ways. Some are sold over-the-counter. Others need a prescription.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8224953\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All teens should have regular check-ups, but check-ups are especially important after you start having sex. Your doctor or nurse will talk with you about STIs and pregnancy, and how to prevent them. He or she can also answer any questions that you have.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8224960\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-aids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: HIV/AIDS (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anogenital-warts-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anogenital warts (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chlamydia and gonorrhea (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-herpes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Genital herpes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hepatitis B (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hepatitis C (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-hpv-vaccine-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-birth-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Choosing birth control (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adolescent-sexuality-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Adolescent sexuality (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
