Patients are less likely to respond well to therapy the longer active disease persists, and it is widely accepted that patients with active RA should be treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) at the earliest stage of disease, ideally within less than three months of symptom onset. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults#H344394776\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults#H111269724\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;, section on 'Early use of DMARDs'</a>.)</p><p>The most commonly used DMARD for the initial treatment of RA is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX), although some patients are unable or reluctant to take this drug, and alternative agents are sometimes necessary as the initial DMARD in place of MTX. The choice of therapeutic agents, including both antiinflammatories and DMARDs, is influenced by multiple factors. (See <a href=\"#H702373648\" class=\"local\">'Approach to management'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The alternatives to MTX as the initial DMARD for the treatment of patients with active RA will be reviewed here.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The choice of the alternative agent to MTX is largely based upon evidence from indirect comparisons and limited head-to-head comparisons; and upon disease severity and prognostic features; comorbidities; patient preferences regarding relative risks and benefits and route of administration; and regulatory, insurance, and cost limitations. (See <a href=\"#H3409402388\" class=\"local\">'Choice of therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Most patients unable to take MTX can be treated initially with another nonbiologic conventional DMARD, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a> (LEF). Alternative nonbiologic DMARDs, depending upon comorbidities, prognostic features, and other factors, include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> (HCQ), and other much less frequently used agents. The use of HCQ monotherapy is typically limited to patients with very mild or limited disease and no adverse prognostic factors, such as being seropositive for rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA).</p><p>In patients unable to use these medications, a biologic agent such as a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>) is typically preferred, but several other biologic agents can be used for initial monotherapy, and if required there are other less frequently used nonbiologic DMARDs, or the kinase inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tofacitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tofacitinib</a>, which are also potential treatment options.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2803800215\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several general principles important in the management of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), regardless of the specific drugs chosen to achieve these.

These issues are addressed in detail separately; briefly, they include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nonpharmacologic and preventive therapies</strong> &ndash; A number of nonpharmacologic measures and other medical interventions are important in the comprehensive management of RA, in addition to antiinflammatory and antirheumatic drug therapies. These interventions, including patient education, vaccinations, cardiovascular risk reduction, and others, are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonpharmacologic-therapies-and-preventive-measures-for-patients-with-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonpharmacologic therapies and preventive measures for patients with rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pretreatment interventions</strong> &ndash; We take a number of important precautions before using DMARDs, including laboratory assessment (complete blood count, serum creatinine, aminotransferases, and other studies as indicated), evaluation of comorbidities, vaccinations, and screening for hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and latent tuberculosis infection. Many rheumatologists obtain a baseline chest radiograph for comparison if pulmonary issues arise. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere.

We do not use these NSAIDs or glucocorticoids as the sole or primary treatments. The use of these medications, including NSAIDs and oral and intraarticular glucocorticoids, is discussed in detail separately.

We avoid the use of stronger opioid analgesics when possible in patients with RA because their pain can be controlled by effective use of antiinflammatories and DMARDs that control the disease process. Patients who appear to require opioids for adequate pain relief should be evaluated for other comorbid causes of pain (eg, fracture, tumor, spinal disorders, fibromyalgia, or others).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Drug therapy for flares</strong> &ndash; RA has natural exacerbations (also known as flares) and reductions of continuing disease activity. It is important to distinguish a disease flare, characterized by symptoms and physical and laboratory findings of increased inflammatory synovitis, from noninflammatory causes of local or generalized increased pain. The severity of the flare and background drug therapy influence the choice of therapies. Drug therapy for flares is discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

Among the available agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a> is our first choice, followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>. A TNF inhibitor would also be preferred in patients in whom LEF should be avoided (eg, patients with hepatitis C or with planned pregnancy).

However, for multiple reasons MTX remains the initial DMARD of choice for most patients, and tofacitinib and tocilizumab are rarely available for this group of patients due to regulatory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cost constraints.

We may also use LEF in patients who have a strong preference for an oral rather than a parenteral agent. In patients unable to use MTX because of liver disease and in women planning pregnancy, LEF should be avoided and an alternative such as SSZ may be appropriate. The use, efficacy, and safety of LEF are discussed in detail separately.

Some randomized trials suggest that LEF is more effective than SSZ in achieving a clinical response, decreasing functional disability, and reducing progression of erosive changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternatives-to-methotrexate-for-the-initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]; others indicate comparable efficacy of the two agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternatives-to-methotrexate-for-the-initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Additionally, the adverse effect profile of LEF is generally similar to that of MTX, with similar rates of withdrawal for drug toxicity at two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternatives-to-methotrexate-for-the-initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. The drug should be avoided in patients with chronic liver disease but may be used in patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction in whom it is safer than MTX. Women of childbearing potential must be on adequate contraception and go through LEF washout prior to pursuing pregnancy. The data that support the efficacy of LEF in the treatment of RA are reviewed elsewhere.
