However, the reality is that this tumor is rarely found among such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-hypertension-pseudopheochromocytoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Between episodes of paroxysmal hypertension, the blood pressure can be elevated (due to inadequately treated chronic hypertension), normal, or low (due to antihypertensive therapy initiated during an episode of paroxysmal hypertension). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychological characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with pseudopheochromocytoma usually insist that episodes are unrelated to emotional distress. This feature has tended to discourage consideration of a causal role for emotional factors. However, details of patients' psychosocial history and the success of psychologically based intervention in some cases (as described below) suggest that the disorder is usually related to emotions that have been kept from conscious awareness and therefore are not reported.</p><p>In the largest study to date, 14 of 21 patients (67 percent) acknowledged a past history of severe emotional trauma (such as the Holocaust or severe childhood trauma) or prolonged physical or emotional abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-hypertension-pseudopheochromocytoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. They uniformly insisted that those events bore no lingering emotional impact. The remaining seven individuals did not report a history of overt emotional trauma or abuse, but careful interviewing indicated a pattern of minimizing awareness of distressful emotions and of not confiding in anyone.</p><p>Individuals with this disorder may feel some degree of emotional distress but seem immune to the more severe emotional distress experienced at times by most other people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to pseudopheochromocytoma, the following diagnoses should be strongly considered among patients presenting with paroxysmal hypertension:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pheochromocytoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Labile hypertension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Panic disorder</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pheochromocytoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma must be excluded in all patients with unprovoked paroxysmal hypertension. Assays of plasma or urine catecholamines are diagnostic in 95 percent of patients with symptoms, and the high sensitivity of the plasma metanephrine assay is also documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-hypertension-pseudopheochromocytoma/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Although there is still uncertainty as to the &quot;best&quot; test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-hypertension-pseudopheochromocytoma/abstract/12,13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,15</a>], most patients with clinically evident pheochromocytoma have very abnormal, rather than mildly abnormal, values. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of pheochromocytoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Labile hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A clear relationship between blood pressure elevation and stress or emotional distress is usually evident among patients with labile hypertension. Patients know they are upset and blame the hypertensive episodes on emotional distress. By contrast, patients with pseudopheochromocytoma insist that the disorder is unrelated to psychologic factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Panic disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Panic disorder is characterized by episodes of fear or panic, and is commonly associated with physical symptoms such as chest pain, headache, palpitations, flushing, and dizziness, along with some degree of blood pressure elevation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-hypertension-pseudopheochromocytoma/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>]. Panic disorder and pseudopheochromocytoma share similar physical symptoms, and both respond to treatment with an antidepressant agent. As mentioned above, panic disorder is present in as many as 40 percent of patients evaluated for pseudopheochromocytoma, compared with 5 percent of control patients with hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-hypertension-pseudopheochromocytoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and, in one report, panic disorder presented as paroxysmal hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-hypertension-pseudopheochromocytoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>However, the two disorders differ from each other in that the presentation of pseudopheochromocytoma is dominated by autonomic manifestations (ie, paroxysmal hypertension). In patients with pseudopheochromocytoma, fear occurs only in response to the physical symptoms. By contrast, panic disorder is dominated by emotional manifestations (ie, panic), and accompanying blood pressure changes are milder.</p><p>The most critical clinical difference is that, in the absence of antecedent panic or emotional distress, pseudopheochromocytoma is viewed as an unexplained medical disorder. Therefore, clinicians and patients rarely consider an emotion-based cause or treatment because, by definition, patients fail to report any triggering emotional distress.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Other causes of paroxysmal hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many additional disorders may present with paroxysmal hypertension, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperthyroidism (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism in adults&quot;</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cluster or migraine headaches (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cluster headache: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults&quot;</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertensive encephalopathy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderate to severe hypertensive retinopathy and hypertensive encephalopathy in adults&quot;</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary insufficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renovascular hypertension (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-secondary-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of secondary hypertension&quot;</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central nervous system lesions, such as stroke, tumor, hemorrhage, compression of lateral medulla, and trauma (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical diagnosis of stroke subtypes&quot;</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizure disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carcinoid (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of the carcinoid syndrome&quot;</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs &ndash; cocaine, lysergic acid diethylamide, amphetamine, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-hypertension-pseudopheochromocytoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tyrosine ingestion combined with monoamine oxidase inhibitors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Baroreflex failure, which is characterized by marked and frequent fluctuations in blood pressure, with both high and low readings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-hypertension-pseudopheochromocytoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Chronic preventative therapy is also indicated.</p><p>Milder paroxysms can usually be managed with oral agents; reliable patients can be instructed to self-administer medication instead of seeking treatment in an emergency department. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute management of paroxysms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a> (beginning with a bolus of 10 or 20 mg initially, followed by 20 to 40 mg every 10 minutes to a maximum dose of 200 to 300 mg) is usually very effective. If the blood pressure elevation is not extreme, oral agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>, can be employed acutely. Response to oral labetalol is less predictable due to considerable inter-individual differences in bioavailability. An anxiolytic agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprazolam</a>, used alone or in combination with an antihypertensive agent, can also effect rapid improvement in both symptoms and blood pressure. Administration of an anxiolytic agent rather than an antihypertensive agent would also reduce the risk of iatrogenic hypotension that can follow resolution of the paroxysm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drugs-used-for-the-treatment-of-hypertensive-emergencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drugs used for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of severe asymptomatic hypertension (hypertensive urgencies) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic preventive management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since pseudopheochromocytoma involves activation of the sympathetic system, treatment with adrenergic blockade is more likely to be effective than management with agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and diuretics, which are directed at mechanisms other than the sympathetic nervous system. The combination of any beta blocker (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> at a dose of 12.5 to 50 mg per day or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bisoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bisoprolol</a> 2.5 to 10 mg daily) and an alpha blocker (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxazosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxazosin</a> at a dose of 0.5 to 2 mg per day) might be effective in reducing the magnitude of blood pressure spikes; however, this has not been assessed in a controlled trial. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Labetalol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carvedilol</a> can also be effective but provide a less reliable degree of alpha and beta blockade. In addition, central alpha agonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>) may be effective, but fatigue and somnolence usually hamper chronic administration. In patients who are normotensive between paroxysms, the risk of hypotension is often a limiting factor in prescribing an antihypertensive regimen. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychopharmacologic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adding an antidepressant is usually dramatically effective in eliminating paroxysms and restoring a normal quality of life in patients in whom severe or very symptomatic paroxysms recur despite alpha and beta blockade, particularly when the disorder is substantially affecting quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-hypertension-pseudopheochromocytoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Even when the patient rejects the possibility of an emotional basis, an antidepressant drug, such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">citalopram</a> at a starting dose of 10 to 20 mg per day or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a> at 50 mg per day), or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a> at a starting dose of 10 to 25 mg per day), perhaps initially combined with an anxiolytic agent, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> (0.5 to 1 mg twice daily), can eliminate attacks. </p><p>There are no data as to whether one antidepressive agent or class is more effective than any other. A period of up to two weeks is usually needed before the main therapeutic effect is evident. </p><p>These agents may have to be prescribed by the primary care clinician if the patient is unwilling to consult a psychiatrist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychotherapeutic intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antihypertensive and psychopharmacologic agents can control, but cannot cure, pseudopheochromocytoma. In some cases, psychological intervention has the potential to cure, providing an attractive alternative to endless pharmacologic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-hypertension-pseudopheochromocytoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, further studies are needed to determine the success rate of psychological interventions in treating this disorder.</p><p>A cure is sometimes possible in patients who are willing to consider the possibility that the disorder is linked to emotional factors. However, many patients, particularly those whose psychological well-being depends upon continued repression of deep-seated, potentially overwhelming, emotions, cannot and will not consider such a possibility. Their refusal to pursue psychotherapy should be honored. It is never appropriate to coerce a patient into psychotherapy, which would be fruitless and potentially harmful.</p><p>Clinical experience suggests that two other psychological interventions can be extremely helpful in managing this disorder. One is reassurance that, although there is a slight risk, hypertensive paroxysms have not been reported to cause sudden cardiovascular events, such as stroke. This reassurance helps considerably in reducing patients' overwhelming fear of stroke or of dying during a paroxysm. However, as a matter of caution, extreme blood pressure elevation (for example, <span class=\"nowrap\">240/140</span> mmHg) should be treated as an emergency. The other intervention is empathetic acknowledgment of prior severe trauma and of the patient's resilience in having survived psychologically. Even in patients who are averse to psychological discussion, affirmation of their psychological resilience can sometimes result in surprising clinical improvement. Studies to formally assess these simple interventions are needed.</p><p>The effectiveness of different treatment modalities was evaluated in the previously mentioned study of 21 patients with pseudopheochromocytoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-hypertension-pseudopheochromocytoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. At a mean follow-up of nine months, a successful outcome was achieved in 13 of 15 evaluable patients, and there was spontaneous resolution in one patient. Treatment failed in two patients. The response to treatment could not be evaluated in the remaining seven patients, among whom two died before treatment could be assessed (neither had pheochromocytoma); one was lost to follow-up; one refused treatment; and one was intolerant of medications.</p><p>Among those successfully treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-hypertension-pseudopheochromocytoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three responded to psychological intervention alone without requiring pharmacologic agents</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ten responded to pharmacologic therapy, seven of whom received an antidepressant, and all of whom received alpha- and beta-blocker therapy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Obstacles to successful treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The emotional basis of pseudopheochromocytoma is rarely suspected because its manifestations are physical and because patients insist that the paroxysms are not related to stress or emotional distress. Emotional distress is viewed as a consequence rather than as a cause of paroxysms. As a result, neither patients nor clinicians are likely to consider an emotional basis, even when a diagnosis or effective treatment has been elusive.</p><p>Psychological awareness, whether achieved with or without psychotherapy, offers the possibility of cure but, in many patients, is not an option since the pertinent repressed emotions may be too overwhelming for patients to confront. In addition, a repressive coping style often is not amenable to psychotherapy. Therefore, in many cases, a psychopharmacologic rather than psychotherapeutic approach is more likely to be effective.</p><p>Some patients will initially refuse either psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacologic intervention. However, the severity of the symptoms and the disruption caused by the disorder will ultimately motivate many patients to accept a therapeutic trial of a psychopharmacologic agent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1275136053\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
