This prevalence is similar to low back pain, but few patients with neck pain lose time from work and less than 1 percent develop neurologic deficits.</p><p>The majority of patients, regardless of the etiology of pain, recover with conservative therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Those with symptoms severe or persistent enough to require medical attention often present a treatment challenge due to the variability of patient symptoms and physical examination findings, lack of specificity of diagnostic imaging, an extensive differential diagnosis, and a relative lack of evidence-based guidelines for management.</p><p>Clinical disorders affecting the cervical spine can be categorized into two basic groups: those that cause significant axial neck pain and those that predominantly cause extremity pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurological dysfunction. Disorders that cause axial neck pain include cervical strain, internal disc disruption syndrome, cervical facet-mediated pain, cervical &quot;whiplash&quot; syndrome, and myofascial pain. Disorders that cause significant extremity symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurological dysfunction include cervical radiculopathy and cervical spondylotic myelopathy.</p><p>Various treatment modalities used to treat axial neck pain are often applied to patients with neck pain accompanied by extremity pain syndromes. Initial treatments directed at a specific cause of axial neck pain have not been shown to lead to improved outcomes compared with non-specific treatments. By contrast, patients with extremity pain with or without neurologic deficit are more likely to have chronic symptoms and require specific surgical intervention. There is no role for surgery for the majority of patients with isolated axial neck pain.</p><p>The management of neck-related pain is reviewed here. The evaluation of patients with neck complaints is discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with neck pain and cervical spine disorders&quot;</a>).</p><p>Cervical radiculopathy and cervical spondylotic myelopathy are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of cervical radiculopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-spondylotic-myelopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical spondylotic myelopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">AXIAL NECK PAIN SYNDROMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 2007 task force on neck pain, representing multiple specialties and institutions, recommends a simple classification system for neck pain severe enough to cause patients to seek care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade I: No signs of major pathology and little interference with daily activities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade II: No signs of major pathology but may impact daily activities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade III: Neck pain with neurological signs or symptoms (radiculopathy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade IV: Neck pain with major pathology (eg, instability or spinal infection)</p><p/><p>Studies have not assessed whether this or other classifications are helpful in determining urgency of care and appropriateness of intervention.</p><p>Several conditions involving the cervical spine and muscles supporting the spine can cause axial neck pain. These conditions, including cervical strain, discogenic pain, facet syndrome, and whiplash, are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with neck pain and cervical spine disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical strain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical strain is a nonspecific diagnosis, related to spasm of the cervical and upper back muscles from injury. The diagnosis of cervical strain is reasonable in patients with acute axial neck and trapezius pain, where neurological dysfunction has been excluded.</p><p>Treatment for cervical strain includes a home exercise regimen, gentle range of motion exercises, and physical therapy. During this acute phase, reassuring the patient about the likelihood of spontaneous improvement is important. There is no role for surgical intervention for this diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical discogenic pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical discogenic pain (or cervical internal disc disruption syndrome) refers to symptomatic disc-related neck pain and may be the most common cause of neck pain. Degenerative disc disease is common in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and the term more aptly refers to a radiologic diagnosis, rather than a clinical syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>].</p><p>Cervical discogenic pain is caused by derangement in the architecture of the disc, with or without features of inflammation. Axial pain is more severe than extremity pain and pain is often exacerbated when the neck is held in one position for prolonged periods. Examination should demonstrate axial neck discomfort with range of motion, a decreased range of motion, and a normal neurological examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical facet syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The zygapophyseal joint, commonly referred to as the facet joint, can also cause axial pain and is probably the most common cause of whiplash related neck pain and headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. This syndrome may be as common as discogenic pain as a cause of spondylosis related to atraumatic neck pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Pain is often midline or offset slightly to one side. As with cervical discogenic pain, axial symptoms are greater than extremity symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Whiplash</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cervical &quot;whiplash&quot; syndrome is caused by a traumatic event with an abrupt <span class=\"nowrap\">flexion/extension</span> movement to the cervical spine. In such injuries, pain can be persistent with little identifiable abnormality on diagnostic studies. Injury may affect multiple components of the neck, including soft tissues, spinal nerves, intervertebral discs, posterior longitudinal ligaments, facet joints, and other osseous structures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT FOR ACUTE AXIAL NECK PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the diversity and complexity of underlying conditions causing neck pain, no one treatment or group of treatments have been shown to be superior to another. Treatment must be individualized and adjusted based on pain control and length of symptoms (acute versus chronic), and altered if neurological symptoms occur. The efficacy of an individualized treatment plan should be based on objective measurements, including physical examination findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with neck pain and cervical spine disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment should incorporate a focus on education of the patient regarding the ubiquity of the condition, the tendency for natural improvement regardless of anatomic findings, and the importance of mental health, physical fitness, and proper posture and ergonomics. The patient should be informed of the high incidence of abnormal findings on imaging studies, and the likelihood that the findings both predate symptoms and will likely persist after symptom improvement. These points may help to overcome the natural tendency of patients and health care providers to become fixated on anatomic findings demonstrated on radiographs and MRI studies. </p><p>The goals of any treatment plan are to reduce pain, muscle irritability, and spasm; to reestablish normal cervical lordosis; and to restore function. Most mild to moderate strains resolve in the first two to three weeks with conservative measures. Patients with severe axial neck pain and particularly whiplash injuries may continue to have symptoms, including headache, for longer periods of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Psychosocial factors are significant in predicting the duration and severity of symptoms after whiplash injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In a study of 2486 Canadian patients with whiplash, slower recovery was found in patients who had more than two visits to a general practitioner, or six visits to a chiropractor, in the first month following injury, controlling for initial injury severity and other prognostic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The authors hypothesized that more aggressive treatment may promote illness behaviors and disability. Other factors associated with poorer prognosis following whiplash injury include report of headache, neck, or low back pain at injury inception; lower level of education; no seatbelt use; higher Neck Disability Index score; and female sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Acute therapy for axial neck pain syndromes includes postural modification, pharmacologic measures, physical therapy, spinal manipulation, and low-level laser therapy (LLLT). Ice or heat applications to the base of the neck and upper back can provide temporary relief of pain and muscle spasm. There is little evidence from controlled trials. The following recommendations are based on our clinical experience in managing these disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Posture modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simple posture modifications are an important part of the treatment regimen. These include sitting straight with the shoulders held back, driving with the arms slightly shrugged (eg, on arm rests), and avoiding carrying bags or gear with straps over the shoulders.</p><p>Sleep position is important. The head and neck should be aligned with the body, best accomplished with a small pillow under the neck. A helpful sleep position is to have the patient lie flat on his or her back with thighs elevated on pillows, thereby flattening the long spinal muscles. Avoidance of cervical extension is helpful for patients with cervical foraminal stenosis due to uncovertebral hypertrophy or foraminal disc herniations.</p><p>Avoidance of a sustained seated posture is often very helpful. Patients should limit time spent sitting in front of a video terminal, prolonged telephone use, and excessive fine motor handwork [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients with neck discomfort and sedentary jobs should make an effort to transition to standing and walking frequently, perform cervical range of motion exercises, and maintain a neutral posture whenever possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although evidence is limited and inconsistent, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be effective for mild to moderate pain and are often the mainstays of pharmacologic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Occasional patients with more severe pain may require mild opioid analgesics or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a>; these drugs are reasonable in the acute phase.</p><p>Muscle relaxants may be used at night, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclobenzaprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclobenzaprine</a> (10 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> and benzodiazepines (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxazepam</a>, 10 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>. Evidence for the effectiveness of muscle relaxants in the relief of neck pain is not as strong as for NSAIDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. If cyclobenzaprine is used during daytime hours, 5 mg three times a day appears to work as well as 10 mg three times a day with somewhat less somnolence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Adding cyclobenzaprine to high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> does not seem to provide additional pain relief in the first 48 hours after minor trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Cyclobenzaprine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methocarbamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methocarbamol</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carisoprodol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carisoprodol</a> have anticholinergic properties and are more likely to cause significant adverse effects in older patients. Sedation is of particular concern in this population and is seen with both non-benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine muscle relaxants. For older patients with acute neck pain not responding to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and nonpharmacologic measures, a time-limited course of a low dose mild opioid might be indicated, with prophylaxis for constipation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-prescribing-for-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug prescribing for older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Home exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Home exercise maintains range of motion and helps patients become active participants in their care. Gentle stretching exercises, including shoulder rolls and neck stretches, should be instituted on a daily basis once acute symptoms are under control:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neck rotation&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F80744\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80744 \">picture 1</a>) &ndash; Slowly turn the head to the right. Place tension on the chin with the fingertips. Hold for a few seconds and return to the center. Repeat to the left.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neck tilting&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61243\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61243 \">picture 2</a>) &ndash; Tilt the head to the right, trying to touch the ear to the tip of the shoulder. Place tension on the temple with the fingertips. Hold for a few seconds and return to the center. Repeat to the left.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neck bending &ndash; Try to touch the chin to the chest. Hold for a few seconds and return to the neutral position. Breathe in gradually, and exhale slowly with each exercise. Relax the neck and back muscles with each neck bend.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shoulder rolls &ndash; In the sitting or standing position, pull the arms backwards. Try to pinch the shoulder blades together, and then roll the arms forward then backward in a rhythmic, rowing motion.</p><p/><p>Patients should be advised to heat their neck and upper back in a bathtub, shower, or with moist towels heated in a microwave prior to beginning exercises. The muscles are gently stretched in sets of 10 to 15 repetitions with each held for five seconds. It is best to perform the exercises in the morning and just before sleeping. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neck-pain-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Neck pain (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After the acute pain has resolved, stretching exercises should be continued three times per week to maintain neck flexibility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258201353\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal manipulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal manipulation is a form of manual therapy that involves the movement of a joint beyond its usual end range of motion but not past its anatomic range of motion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal manipulation in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Little data exist on the effects of spinal manipulation in patients with acute neck pain. One trial randomly assigned 272 patients with acute or subacute neck pain (2 to 12 week duration) to spinal manipulation, pharmacotherapy, or home exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Spinal manipulation led to decreased self-reported neck pain after 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks of follow-up, compared with medications (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, narcotics, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> muscle relaxants). However, two sessions of home exercise instruction led to similar improvements in pain compared with a mean of 15 spinal manipulation visits. This trial was limited by lack of blinding by participants and providers. There was also no placebo or sham comparison group. Due to study limitations of current evidence and the small risk for serious adverse outcomes, including permanent impairment or death, manipulation of the cervical spine is not recommended as first-line treatment for acute neck pain. Spinal manipulation may be appropriate for those not responding to conservative measures, including medication and home exercise instruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal manipulation in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain&quot;, section on 'Neck pain and headache'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical collar</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine use of cervical collars should be discouraged; regular use may actually delay improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Representative studies on the use of cervical collars for neck pain follow:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study that randomly assigned 61 patients with whiplash injury to rest plus cervical collar immobilization, or early active mobilization, the active mobilization group had significantly greater improvement in the degree of cervical movement and pain intensity at eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 196 patients with acute whiplash injury, 104 patients were assigned to wear a cervical collar and 92 to usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Pain persisted at six weeks in 122 patients (62 percent). There was no difference between the two groups in terms of pain, complete recovery, improvement, or deterioration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review concluded that the data on therapy of whiplash injury are relatively weak, but that active interventions may be effective while rest and immobilization are not generally recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p>Nevertheless, a soft cervical collar is safe and inexpensive, and may be helpful during periods of increased pain, particularly to facilitate sleep when this is interrupted by pain. It is important to stress that collars should be worn for short periods of time (three hours or less) during the day for a period of only one to two weeks in order to avoid the development of muscle atrophy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Low level laser therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low level laser therapy (LLLT) is a non-thermal, single wavelength of light directed at the area of discomfort. Although the exact mechanism of action is not known, it is believed that LLLT may aid tissue repair, relieve pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stimulate acupuncture points. In a meta-analysis of two small trials assessing LLLT in acute neck pain, patients randomly assigned to LLLT were found to have improvement in pain compared with placebo laser (RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Larger randomized, placebo-controlled trials are needed before LLLT can be recommended for therapy in clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2054878130\"><span class=\"h1\">PREDICTORS OF CHRONIC PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Predictive factors for persistent neck pain include greater age, accompanying low back pain, neck trauma, headache, radiation of pain, being employed, and prior episodes of neck pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In another study, psychosocial and neurophysiological factors including having a depressed mood, weak cervical muscle endurance, and impaired pain inhibition were risk factors for developing chronic neck pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Poor sleep is a complicating comorbidity which is found in 70 percent of patients with chronic neck pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT FOR PERSISTENT AXIAL NECK PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with persistent symptoms beyond six weeks should have radiologic studies to define the etiology of their neck pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with neck pain and cervical spine disorders&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Many treatment options have been proposed for treatment of chronic neck pain; there is little high quality evidence supporting the effectiveness of many of these interventions. Exercise, and multimodal care combining exercise with other therapies, has most consistently demonstrated benefit for patients with Grades I or II neck pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical therapy is fundamental to the treatment and prevention of recurrent neck pain. In addition to the exercises described above, patients with pain may benefit from physical therapy. Physical therapy should be directed towards patient education and therapeutic exercise, with adjunctive use of other modalities such as heat, ice, electrical stimulation, traction, myofascial release, and mobilization techniques. The goal of physical therapy is for patients to become independent with their exercise regimen and to avoid chronic dependence on treatments.</p><p>In a 2001 review of the literature, the Philadelphia Panel evaluated evidence for the effectiveness of the following physical therapy modalities for treatment of neck pain: <span class=\"nowrap\">exercise/neuromuscular</span> reeducation, traction, ultrasound, TENS, massage, thermotherapy, electrical stimulation, EMG biofeedback, and combined rehabilitation interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Evidence indicated clinical benefit for proprioceptive and therapeutic exercise; data were insufficient to evaluate the other modalities except for traction and massage therapy. </p><p>In a randomized trial comparing strength training, dynamic neck exercises, and no intervention in 180 female office workers with constant or frequent neck pain of &gt;6 months duration, more women in the strength training and neck exercises than in the no intervention group had substantial or complete relief of pain at one year (73, 59, and 21 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, another randomized trial involving female office workers found that dynamic muscle training and relaxation training were no more effective than ordinary activity for pain relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>The optimal number of sessions is not clear. A randomized trial comparing one to three with five sessions of physical therapy in patients with subacute and chronic neck found that five sessions only marginally improved functional disability and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The generalizability of this study to settings in which more treatment sessions are commonly employed is limited. Moreover, the benefit of exercise may differ among specific subgroups of patients with chronic neck pain such as those with whiplash injuries. A randomized trial found no difference at 12 months between a comprehensive exercise program of 20 sessions versus advice in patients with chronic whiplash injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1052619284\"><span class=\"h3\">Traction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence for the effectiveness of cervical traction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>] was found inconclusive in systematic reviews because of methodologic flaws. In two studies of cervical traction, no benefit was seen compared with sham traction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The review also concluded that neither manipulation nor mobilization was superior to the other and that there was insufficient evidence about their effects in patients with radicular findings (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of cervical radiculopathy&quot;</a>). Subsequent to the systematic review, a randomized trial in 94 patients with mechanical neck pain found that a combination of manual therapy (both thrust and non-thrust) plus exercise (biweekly for three weeks), compared with usual care with sham ultrasound, led to decreased disability scores at both short and long term, greater pain relief at short term, and increased patient perception of recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>A systematic review concluded that short-term benefit is demonstrable for spine manipulation in patients with neck pain, but the small risk for serious adverse outcomes, including permanent impairment or death, must be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neck-pain/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Because of the unproven benefit and potential complications, particularly in the older adult population, manipulation of the cervical spine is not recommended for chronic neck pain. However, in the absence of radicular symptoms or signs, it is an option for younger patients with acute neck pain who fail to improve despite analgesics and postural education (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal manipulation in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain&quot;, section on 'Neck pain and headache'</a>).
