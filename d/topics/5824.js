The majority of ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tube (84 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-surgical-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], but other possible sites include the cervix, interstitial portion of the fallopian tube (also referred to as cornual; this is a pregnancy located in the proximal segment of the fallopian tube that is embedded within the muscular wall of the uterus), <span class=\"nowrap\">hysterotomy/cesarean</span> scar, myometrium, ovary, or abdomen.

Thus, it is often the treatment of last resort and there are few contraindications. For women who are candidates for either surgical or medical therapy, patient characteristics that increase the risk of perioperative complications are relative contraindications to surgery.</p><p>In hemodynamically stable women, surgical intervention should be performed <strong>only</strong> if a transvaginal ultrasound examination clearly shows a tubal ectopic pregnancy or an adnexal mass suggestive of ectopic pregnancy. If no mass is visualized sonographically, there is a high likelihood that a tubal pregnancy will not be visualized or palpated at surgery, and the surgery may be unnecessary or unsuccessful. This may occur in early gestations in which the ectopic pregnancy is small or if the abnormal pregnancy is actually intrauterine or at another ectopic site. These women should be managed conservatively with either medical therapy or expectant management. A repeat ultrasound examination after a few days may visualize an abnormality, thus enabling a surgical procedure, if this option is desired. If there is diagnostic uncertainty about whether a pregnancy is intrauterine or ectopic and it is certain that the pregnancy is not viable, a dilation and curettage may be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H265533347\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Curettage'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL PLANNING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Salpingostomy versus salpingectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two choices of surgical approach for tubal pregnancy. Salpingectomy (removal of the fallopian tube) and salpingostomy (incising the tube to remove the tubal gestation but leaving the remainder of the tube intact) appear to result in similar fertility outcomes in subsequent pregnancies. Traditionally, salpingectomy has been the standard procedure, but salpingostomy provides a conservative option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-surgical-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Two randomized trials have compared salpingostomy with salpingectomy and found similar fertility outcomes; however, both trials lacked sufficient statistical power to detect infrequent outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-surgical-treatment/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Neither trial found a statistically significant difference in the risk of recurrent ectopic pregnancy, but one trial favored salpingostomy while the other favored salpingectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-surgical-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Operative morbidity was similar for both procedures. The results of the trials were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One trial (n = 199) found that salpingostomy and salpingectomy resulted in similar rates of spontaneous conception of an intrauterine pregnancy at two years (70 versus 64 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-surgical-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In the salpingostomy group, 21 women (21 percent) ultimately had salpingectomy for persistent tubal bleeding. The rate of persistent trophoblast was not reported. The rates of recurrent ectopic pregnancy did not differ significantly (8 versus 12 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another trial (n = 446), women with a tubal pregnancy who had conceived without in vitro fertilization were assigned to salpingostomy or salpingectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-surgical-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Randomization was done at surgery after confirmation of the diagnosis of tubal ectopic pregnancy and the presence of a healthy-looking contralateral tube. Salpingostomy compared with salpingectomy had no significant difference in rate of spontaneous conception at 36 months (61 versus 56 percent). As expected, the salpingostomy group had a higher rate of persistent trophoblast (7 versus &lt;1 percent). Surgical complication rates were low for both groups. The rate of repeat ectopic pregnancy in the ipsilateral tube was similar (3 versus 1 percent).</p><p/><p>Data from these two trials was combined in a meta-analysis with data from eight comparative observational studies that included an additional 654 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-surgical-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Pooled statistics from the observational studies showed that, for salpingostomy compared with salpingectomy, there was a significantly higher spontaneous intrauterine pregnancy rate (72 versus 54 percent, risk ratio [RR] 1.24, 95% CI 1.08-1.42), but the rate of recurrent ectopic pregnancy was significantly higher (10 versus 4 percent, RR 2.27, 95% CI 1.12-4.58).</p><p>The choice of salpingostomy or salpingectomy relies upon many factors and includes shared decision-making between the surgeon and patient.</p><p>Salpingectomy is the standard procedure if the condition of the tube with the ectopic gestation is damaged (ruptured or otherwise disrupted), bleeding is uncontrolled, or the gestation appears too large to remove with salpingostomy.</p><p>Another advantage of salpingectomy is that it avoids the need for further treatment for persistent trophoblast, which is required in some women following salpingostomy. This typically involves treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and, while this is generally safe and effective, it does require further follow-up and some potential morbidity. Based upon the risk of retained gestational tissue following salpingostomy, salpingectomy is required in women who have contraindications to methotrexate therapy.</p><p>For women who have completed childbearing, bilateral salpingectomy may be performed as permanent sterilization. An additional potential benefit of salpingectomy rather than another method of sterilization is a decrease in the risk of tubal neoplasia with spread to the ovary. Salpingectomy appears to be associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer, and some data suggest that the tube is the site of origin for some high-grade serous carcinomas that were presumed to be ovarian. However, further study of this is needed, and unilateral salpingectomy has not been investigated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opportunistic-salpingectomy-for-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-carcinoma-risk-reduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opportunistic salpingectomy for ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal carcinoma risk reduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>On the other hand, the advantage of salpingostomy is preservation of the tube for potential future fertility. Even with unilateral salpingectomy, women may have anxiety regarding future fertility. Removal of a fallopian tube, despite a conserved tube. In particular, salpingostomy is preferred for women who desire future childbearing and in whom the contralateral tube is absent or damaged. The availability and high intrauterine pregnancy rate of in vitro fertilization (IVF) have decreased the need to preserve diseased fallopian tubes, including tubes with an ectopic pregnancy. However, many women do not have access to IVF for financial, geographic, or religious reasons.</p><p>Salpingectomy is required for women with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ruptured tube or moderately or severely damage tube</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uncontrolled tubal bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large tubal pregnancy &ndash; In our practice, we use 3 cm as the threshold</p><p/><p>Women may also choose salpingectomy if they are planning IVF for subsequent conceptions or if they desire permanent sterilization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Laparoscopy versus laparotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopic surgery is the standard surgical approach for ectopic pregnancy. Most ectopic pregnancies, even in the presence of hemoperitoneum, may be treated using a laparoscopic procedure. However, for patients with acute bleeding, some surgeons prefer laparotomy. The choice of surgical approach should be made by the surgeon with consultation from the anesthesiologist and by taking into consideration the clinical status of the patient.</p><p>In addition, some surgeons prefer laparotomy for interstitial pregnancy. This is a rare type of ectopic pregnancy, and surgeons may have less experience with the procedure. The procedure may also result in more blood loss and require suturing because a myometrial incision is involved. (See <a href=\"#H1551137940\" class=\"local\">'Interstitial pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p>The benefits of laparoscopy were illustrated in a systematic review of randomized trials that compared laparoscopic salpingostomy with the open surgical approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-surgical-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Laparoscopic salpingostomy resulted in significantly shorter operation time (73 versus 88 minutes), less perioperative blood loss (79 versus 195 mL), shorter duration of hospital stay (1 to 2 versus 3 to 5 days), shorter convalescence time (11 versus 24 days), and, therefore, lower costs.</p><p>Laparoscopic salpingostomy resulted in a higher rate of persistent trophoblast than salpingostomy via laparotomy (odds ratio 3.5, 95% CI 1.1-11; actual risk <span class=\"nowrap\">9/78</span> [11.5 percent] versus <span class=\"nowrap\">3/87</span> [3.4 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-surgical-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, there were no significant differences in the rate of subsequent intrauterine pregnancy or repeat ectopic pregnancy. The higher rate of persistent ectopic pregnancy following laparoscopic salpingostomy may reflect the experience of the laparoscopic surgeon.</p><p>Use of single-port laparoscopy (also referred to as laparoendoscopic single-site surgery [LESS]) for ectopic pregnancy has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-surgical-treatment/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>]. As an example, a prospective study reported that women with a tubal pregnancy who underwent salpingectomy with LESS compared with conventional laparoscopy had similar outcomes for operative duration, blood loss, and hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-surgical-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

In our practice, we use a solution of 0.2 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> of physiologic saline and inject volume of up to 5 mL.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using electrosurgery or scissors, a 10 mm longitudinal incision is made along the tube overlying the ectopic gestation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72097\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72097 \">figure 2</a>). The incision is made along the border of the tube that is not on the side to which the mesosalpinx attaches.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The products of conception are released from the tube using a combination of hydrodissection with irrigating solution under high pressure and gentle blunt dissection with a suction irrigator. The specimen can then be placed into a laparoscopic pouch and removed from the abdominal cavity; it is also useful for removal of large fragments of placental tissue. Using fluid to remove the gestation is preferable to removing it bluntly. Extracting the products of conception in pieces with forceps may lead to retained trophoblastic tissue, particularly in the area of the tube proximal to the ectopic gestation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tube is carefully irrigated and inspected for hemostasis. Bleeding points can be controlled by applying pressure or coagulated with light application of bipolar coagulation. In order to avoid excessive coagulation to the tube, we use a microbipolar forceps. If bleeding persists, vessels in the mesosalpinx can be ligated with 6-0 polyglactin suture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54391\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54391 \">figure 3</a>). The placental bed inside the tube should not be coagulated because this will seriously damage the tube.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incision is left open to heal by secondary intention; the subsequent rates of fertility and adhesion formation are similar after secondary intention or primary closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-surgical-treatment/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Salpingectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Salpingectomy is the removal of a portion or all of the fallopian tube.</p><p>Total or partial salpingectomy may be performed for the tube with the ectopic gestation. The decision for partial versus total salpingectomy depends upon the patient's age, whether she has one or two tubes, the condition of the tube, and plans for future fertility.</p><p>If the tubal damage is confined to a midportion tubal segment containing the ectopic gestation, either a partial or total salpingectomy may be performed. If the length of the remaining portions of tube is minimal or the fimbria must be removed to remove the ectopic gestation, total salpingectomy is performed.</p><p>If the patient has two tubes, removal of one tube will not necessarily result in tubal sterilization. If the patient has one tube, salpingectomy results in tubal sterilization, limiting the patient's pregnancy option to in vitro fertilization (IVF). Total bilateral salpingectomy is performed if the patient desires sterilization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> desires opportunistic salpingectomy for potential ovarian cancer risk reduction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opportunistic-salpingectomy-for-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-carcinoma-risk-reduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opportunistic salpingectomy for ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal carcinoma risk reduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In general, we perform partial salpingectomy to allow the option for tubal reanastomosis at a future date. However, in women who will undergo IVF, we prefer total salpingectomy to decrease the possibility of tubal stump pregnancy and the development of hydrosalpinx of the proximal portion of the tube. The presence of a hydrosalpinx decreases the IVF pregnancy rate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=in-vitro-fertilization#H627727236\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;In vitro fertilization&quot;, section on 'Hydrosalpinx'</a>.)</p><p>There are several methods for laparoscopic salpingectomy. One approach is to bring the fallopian tube through a pre-tied surgical loop using a grasping forceps. The knot is tightened; the tube is then resected and removed. A second loop can be placed on the excised stump (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F96493\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96493 \">figure 4</a>). </p><p>Alternatively, electrosurgery or preferably a device with minimal thermal effects can be used to seal the vessels in the mesosalpinx, followed by resection of the specimen with scissors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50215\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50215 \">figure 5</a>). The cornual portion of the tube is excised close to the uterus. It is important to elevate the tube and cut the mesosalpinx close to the tube to avoid inadvertently damaging the ovarian vessels.</p><p>If laparotomy is performed, total salpingectomy via laparotomy is accomplished by placing a clamp across the mesosalpinx and then placing a second clamp across the proximal portion of the fallopian tube as close as possible to the cornua (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61769\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61769 \">figure 6</a>). The tips of the clamps should touch to completely occlude the vessels in the mesosalpinx. The tube is then excised and the pedicles ligated using a 2-0 or 3-0 synthetic absorbable suture. For partial salpingectomy, the clamps are placed proximal and distal to the ectopic gestation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outcomes and complications particular to surgical treatment of ectopic pregnancy are reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1551138407\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical complications for laparoscopy or laparotomy are discussed separately.

If the woman does not conceive in the first 12 to 18 months or her contralateral tube is damaged or absent, referral for in vitro fertilization is appropriate.

In current practice, interstitial pregnancy is typically diagnosed at an earlier gestational age and prior to rupture, thus providing an opportunity for conservative medical or surgical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-surgical-treatment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In our practice, we prefer laparoscopic removal of interstitial gestations via cornuostomy, with resection of the interstitial portion of the tube (cornual resection) if necessary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52644\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52644 \">figure 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-surgical-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Cornual resection is technically more demanding than cornuostomy. It might also be associated with increased morbidity.</p><p>The procedure for laparoscopic cornuostomy is as follows: Dilute intramyometrial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> is injected into the cornual myometrium at the commencement of the operation to minimize blood loss and improve visibility. Alternatively, hemostasis can be achieved by ligating the ascending branches of the uterine vessels. If a cornuostomy is planned, the products of conception can be removed with hydrodissection, grasping forceps, aspiration, or gentle curettage. We prefer hydrodissection to flush out the gestational products, as it helps to ascertain complete removal of trophoblast.</p><p>Successful hysteroscopic removal of interstitial ectopic pregnancy has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-surgical-treatment/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. The efficacy and long-term results of this technique are unknown.</p><p>The possibility of uterine rupture during a subsequent pregnancy should be discussed with women undergoing treatment for interstitial pregnancy. The risk of uterine rupture after medical treatment of an interstitial pregnancy is unknown and the integrity of the uterus following conservative surgical treatment is unclear, although cases of uterine rupture have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-surgical-treatment/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. Multilayered suturing of the myometrium and serosa of the uterine cornua following conservative surgical treatment may prevent this complication.</p><p>Close antenatal monitoring of women with a history of interstitial pregnancy is mandatory. The patient should be counseled regarding whether a cesarean delivery at term is advised to avoid the risk of uterine rupture during labor.

Most women with ectopic pregnancy are treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>. Indications for surgical therapy include hemodynamic instability, suspicion of or risk factors for rupture, contraindications to methotrexate, or failed medical therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical intervention should only be considered if a transvaginal ultrasound examination clearly shows a tubal ectopic pregnancy or an adnexal mass suggestive of ectopic pregnancy. If no abnormality is imaged sonographically, there is a high probability that an ectopic pregnancy will not be visualized or palpated at surgery. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most women with an unruptured tubal pregnancy and a reasonably undamaged tube who are planning surgical treatment, we suggest salpingostomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Salpingectomy is required for women with a ruptured tube, uncontrolled tubal bleeding, moderately or severely damaged tube, or large tubal pregnancy (3 to 5 cm). Women may also reasonably choose salpingectomy if they are planning in vitro fertilization for subsequent conceptions or if they desire permanent sterilization. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Salpingostomy versus salpingectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopic surgery is the standard surgical approach for ectopic pregnancy. Most ectopic pregnancies, even in the presence of hemoperitoneum, may be treated using a laparoscopic procedure. However, for patients with acute bleeding, some surgeons prefer laparotomy. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Laparoscopy versus laparotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent ectopic pregnancy after salpingostomy occurs in 4 to 15 percent of cases. We perform a single serum human chorionic gonadotropin measurement one week after surgery. A level that is less than 5 percent of the preoperative value is consistent with complete resolution of the ectopic pregnancy; a higher value calls for repeat measurement. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Persistent ectopic pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After an ectopic pregnancy, 38 to 89 percent of women will achieve a subsequent intrauterine gestation. Recurrent ectopic pregnancy occurs in 15 percent (range 4 to 28 percent); the recurrence risk rises to 30 percent following two ectopic pregnancies. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Outcome and follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the woman does not conceive in the first 12 to 18 months after surgical therapy of ectopic pregnancy or her contralateral tube is damaged or absent, referral for in vitro fertilization is appropriate.
