In a hospital study, among 205 patients initiated on dialysis between 1999 and 2000, the cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was unknown in 135 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>A number of subsequently published studies revealed a high prevalence of CKD of unknown etiology in specific regions of El Salvador and Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Costa Rica [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study of 291 men from the coastlands of El Salvador, the prevalence of previously undiagnosed CKD (defined by creatinine &ge;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> was 13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Of these, only 38 percent had diabetes or hypertension (which are common causes of CKD in other areas), while the remainder did not appear to have a clear-cut cause for CKD.

Among 98 individuals with a low eGFR who had their urine examined, 79 percent had no proteinuria detected by a paper strip indicator, and there were no associations with well-known risk factors for CKD such as hypertension or diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with construction workers and farmers, sugarcane cutters in Chinandega and Leon municipalities in Nicaragua had greater exposure to heat and consume more fluid on workdays but had less obesity, lower blood sugar, lower blood pressure, and a better lipid profile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Reduced eGFR occurred in 16, 9, and 2 percent of sugarcane cutters, construction workers, and farmers, respectively. Serum uric acid levels related strongly and inversely to eGFR levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In men aged 50 to 54 years, the CKD-associated mortality rate in Nicaragua and El Salvador between 2000 and 2009 was approximately <span class=\"nowrap\">110/100,000</span> population compared with less than <span class=\"nowrap\">40/100,000</span> population in countries such as Panama, Cuba, and Costa Rica [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Between 2004 and 2013, the average annual incidence rate of ESRD in the Bajo Lempa region of El Salvador was 1410 per million population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Most patients were male (9:1), and two-thirds of patients did not report diabetes or hypertension. Few received renal replacement therapy (RRT), and patient mortality was high even with RRT.</p><p/><p>Based on indirect data from diagnostic codes, the prevalence of CKD appears to be increasing in Nicaragua and El Salvador. In Nicaragua, CKD-related mortality increased from 4 to 10 per 100,000 inhabitants between 1992 and 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. CKD-associated mortality rates were as high as 35 per 100,000 in regions close to the Pacific in this study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Cross-sectional studies in these same regions reported a high prevalence of decreased eGFR.</p><p>The CKD mortality also appears to have increased in specific regions of Costa Rica [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In the Guanacaste province, at the northwest Pacific coast of Costa Rica, among men over 29 years of age, the age-standardized CKD-associated mortality rates per 100,000 increased from 5.8 in the early 1970s to 75.0 in years between 2007 and 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The rate increase in this region of Costa Rica is much higher than that observed in the rest of Costa Rica (which was from 5.9 in the early 1970s to 16.2 between 2007 and 2012). For women, rates increased from 4.5 to 20.7 in Guanacaste versus 4.2 to 9.7 in the rest of the country [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In both El Salvador and Nicaragua, MeN appears to be most prevalent in low-altitude, coastal regions. As an example, in a study of 664 individuals from five communities in El Salvador, the prevalence of CKD (defined as eGFR &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) among men from the two coastal communities was 19 and 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. By contrast, the prevalence in the high-altitude populations was below 2 percent.</p><p>Regional differences in prevalence are also present in Nicaragua. In a study of 1096 people from five villages in northwestern Nicaragua, the prevalence of CKD was higher in villages located close to the coast and at a low altitude [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, CKD defined by an elevated serum creatinine was highest among men in agricultural regions compared with nonagricultural regions. The pattern was similar for women. As noted above, in another study from Nicaragua, based on indirect data from diagnostic codes, CKD-related mortality varied between different regions, with rates up to 35 per 100,000 in regions close to the Pacific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>A high prevalence of CKD, similar to MeN, may exist among other agricultural populations in hot climates, and some have suggested using the term chronic interstitial nephritis in agricultural communities (CINAC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p>As an example, reports from certain areas of Sri Lanka describe a high prevalence of CKD of unknown etiology, with similar characteristics and risk factors as MeN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. However, it is not clear at this time whether the pathogenesis of CKD in Sri Lanka is that same as that of MeN. In fact, the renal pathology appears more heterogeneous in Sri Lanka [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1148366521\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple putative risk factors for MeN have been suggested, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/2-4,13,14,20,30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,13,14,20,30-33</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agricultural and physically demanding work in a hot climate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exposure to pesticides</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &gt;60 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low body mass</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consumption of sugar-containing rehydration drinks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower socioeconomic class or poverty</p><p/><p>Hard, physical work in hot climates appears to be the most important underlying risk factor for MeN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/2-4,13,20,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,13,20,31</a>]. In a population study cited above, the prevalence of CKD increased with increasing number of years of work in the coastal sugarcane or cotton plantations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, work on sugarcane or cotton plantation was the strongest predictor for CKD among men for each 10-year period (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F101831\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101831 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>In a study from El Salvador, the rates of hospital admissions for unspecified CKD and nondiabetic ESRD were highest in the southwestern municipalities of La Paz Department, which is the region of highest ambient temperatures (33 to 36&ordm;C) in El Salvador [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Percent area of sugarcane cultivation was predictive of CKD by bivariate analysis; the strength of association with heat was less robust by multivariate analysis.</p><p>In another study from El Salvador, CKD was twice as common among male agricultural workers compared with nonagricultural workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Similar associations were reported from Nicaragua. In a case-control study from a Nicaraguan township with a high prevalence of CKD, in addition to age and male sex, the strongest independent association to CKD was lifetime hours cutting sugarcane, particularly during the dry season [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In a cross-sectional study of 2275 residents in Leon, Nicaragua, risk factors for CKD (eGFR &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) were older age, living in rural zone, lower education level, self-reported high blood pressure, years of agricultural work, alcohol consumption, and higher levels of daily water consumption. All were associated in a dose-response-related manner with increasing prevalence of CKD. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for low eGFR increased from 1.3, 1.7, 2.6, and 2.9 with increasing five years of work in agriculture and likewise decreasing educational level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The putative association between MeN and hard, physical labor in a warm climate (&quot;heat stress&quot;) was supported in a study of 284 Nicaraguan sugarcane workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Workers included cane cutters (n = 51), seeders (n = 36), seed cutters (n = 19), agrochemical applicators (n = 29), irrigators (n = 49), drivers (n = 41), and factory workers (n = 59) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The GFR estimated by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation decreased during harvest in all groups exposed to heat stress but not in drivers and factory workers who were not exposed to heat stress. The changes in eGFR were small, however, and may have been affected by differences in muscle mass or diet and not reflective of true differences in clearance.</p><p>Contact with pesticides has been proposed as a risk factor, although this has been disputed. Contact with pesticides is common in agricultural communities with high CKD prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In the study from Nicaragua cited above, in models that adjusted for total hours cutting sugarcane during the dry season, MeN was associated with inhaling pesticides (OR 2.61, 95% CI 0.99&ndash;6.90) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>However, most reports do not support an association between pesticides and CKD. In a case-control study from northwestern Nicaragua including 997 individuals with 12.4 percent identified as having CKD, age, male sex, low body mass, agricultural field work, consumption of local-brewed liquor, and consumption of large amounts of water daily, but not exposure to pesticides, were related to a low eGFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>In another study, pesticides did not appear to confer increased risk in the absence of other risk factors (particularly hot climate) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Among 267 individuals (147 women) aged 20 to 60 years in a coffee-growing village in north-central Nicaragua (which is located 1000 meters above sea level and where the climate is less hot as compared with areas close to the Pacific coast), CKD was not common despite reports of pesticide exposure among 92 percent of men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>In general, although pesticides are known to cause acute and sometimes chronic health effects in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], pesticides rarely exert nephrotoxic effects, apart from in association with severe systemic intoxications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Sugar-containing rehydration drinks have been suggested as a risk factor for MeN. In the study from Nicaragua, in models that adjusted for total hours cutting sugarcane during the dry season, MeN was associated with the consumption of a sugar-containing rehydration drink (&quot;bolis&quot;) of borderline significance (OR 1.39, 95% CI 0.99&ndash;1.95) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There was also a significant association between MeN and chewing sugarcane (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.11&ndash;6.77) in this study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1927648306\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of MeN is not known with certainty. The most likely causes include repeated episodes of acute kidney injury (AKI) related to dehydration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/2-4,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,40</a>] and acute or chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis related to an infectious or toxic exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>Dehydration-related AKI is suggested by a study of 28 healthy, Brazilian sugarcane workers in whom the plasma creatinine increased by the end of the workday (by an average of 0.24 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 0.21 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> and 5 of the 28 examined men (18 percent) had AKI, defined as a 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 1.5-fold increase in creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Significant dehydration was suggested by symptoms such as frequent muscle cramps during the cutting season and a high urine osmolality (average 890 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/L)</span>. Repeated episodes of AKI may evolve into chronic kidney disease (CKD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p>Tubulointerstitial nephritis is suggested by active surveillance studies performed in a high-risk area of Nicaragua [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Selected individuals who met proposed criteria for an early acute form of MeN had laboratory studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] and biopsy findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>] that are pathognomonic for tubulointerstitial nephritis. However, it is not clear yet whether the individuals who met the proposed criteria for acute MeN went on to develop the chronic form of MeN. The clinical presentation of these individuals and the biopsy findings are described below. (See <a href=\"#H2774894813\" class=\"local\">'Acute presentation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1231556819\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> below.)</p><p>A potential precipitant for tubulointerstitial nephritis has not been identified. Typically, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis is related to exposure to a drug or toxin or infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>The excess use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may contribute to MeN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The role of NSAIDs is suggested by analysis of biopsies from MeN-affected individuals showing glomerular changes indicative of glomerular ischemia, despite only minor vascular changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Perturbations in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) due to excessive and repeated losses of salts due to excessive sweating may also be involved in the pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Activation of the polyol pathway and increased renal cortical fructose levels during episodes of dehydration may contribute to MeN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/3,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,47</a>]. This was suggested by animal studies in which increases in kidney fructose concentrations were demonstrated in heat-stressed mice and heat-induced AKI was prevented in fructokinase-deficient mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Based on these data, a hypothesis has been generated that the consumption of fructose-containing rehydration drinks by severely dehydrated agricultural workers may increase the risk of MeN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/3,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,48</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1148366521\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>Multiple other contributing factors have been suggested including inorganic arsenic, aristolochic acid, mycotoxins, leptospirosis, pesticides, hard water, alcoholic drinks, hypokalemia, and hyperuricemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/2-4,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,49</a>].

These symptoms often cause them to take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which may contribute to the kidney disease. Some reports suggest that workers may be reluctant to hydrate because of perceptions of water contamination.</p><p>Other nonspecific symptoms including headache, tachycardia, fever, nausea, difficulty breathing, dizziness, swelling of <span class=\"nowrap\">hands/feet,</span> and dysuria are often described as occurring weekly, particularly among harvesters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]<em>.</em></p><p>Many patients describe fainting during work, nocturia, and dysuria associated with back or flank pain (&quot;chistata&quot;), which often leads to prescription of antibiotics for presumed urinary tract infection; in most cases, cultures are not performed, however [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Patients are usually normotensive or only mildly hypertensive and show no evidence of edema.

Biopsies of patients who presented with chronic kidney disease (CKD) showed tubular atrophy and fibrosis coupled with widespread chronic glomerular changes, including glomerulosclerosis and hypertrophy of the glomerular tufts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/46,54,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,54,56</a>]. Chronic glomerular ischemia was suggested by wrinkling of glomerular capillaries and thickening of Bowman&rsquo;s capsule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Prominent vascular lesions were not present, but intimal fibrosis and thickening of the tunica media of extraglomerular blood vessels were observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/46,54,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,54,56</a>].

In this study, biopsies were performed on 11 individuals in a high-risk area of Nicaragua who met criteria for acute MeN (see <a href=\"#H2774894813\" class=\"local\">'Acute presentation'</a> above). Histology showed interstitial inflammation with predominant mononuclear cell infiltrate. There was evidence of both acute injury (acute tubular cell injury, interstitial edema, early fibrosis) and chronic injury (tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis). Glomeruli and blood vessels were largely normal.</p><p>The morphological findings in this renal biopsy study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>] differ from previously described series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/46,53,54,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,53,54,56</a>] in which interstitial inflammation was not prominent and glomerular changes were observed. The observed histologic differences may reflect differences in the patient case mix. The study of acute MeN included patients with leukocyturia and leucocytosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neutrophilia, suggesting acute inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], whereas patients included in the earlier biopsy series had established CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/46,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,54</a>].

The histologic features observed on biopsy include tubular atrophy and fibrosis coupled with chronic glomerular changes, including glomerulosclerosis, hypertrophy, and collapse of glomerular tufts indicative of glomerular ischemia.

It has been suggested that fructose-containing fluids should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]; however, there are no clinical data that suggest that fructose-containing fluids are harmful in humans.</p><p>Workers should limit exposure to heat and, if possible, avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), at least during the season of highest risk (ie, the harvesting season for sugarcane workers).</p><p>An interventional program modelled after the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)'s Water-Rest-Shade program may reduce the impact of the heat stress conditions for the workforce in El Salvador [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The provision of water, shaded rest areas, scheduled rest periods, ergonomically improved machetes, and efficiency strategies increased self-reported water consumption by 25 percent and decreased symptoms associated with heat stress and dehydration. At the same time, the individual daily cut cane production increased. Cross-shift estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decrease was present in both intervention and control groups but smaller for the intervention group, and the decreased eGFR over the five-month harvest was smaller in the intervention group than in the control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Even if pesticides eventually are found not to cause CKD, there is no doubt that any potential hazards associated with their use should be minimized, and sustainable, nontoxic pest control methods should be encouraged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesoamerican-nephropathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>We suggest not using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) among individuals at risk for MeN, although these agents have been shown to be renoprotective in other forms of CKD and are effective antihypertensive agents.
