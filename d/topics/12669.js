Optimal patient outcomes often result from multiple approaches utilized in concert, coordinated via a multidisciplinary team [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Medication should not be the sole focus of treatment, but should be used when needed, in conjunction with other treatment modalities, to meet treatment goals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Patients with chronic pain require ongoing evaluation, education and reassurance, as well as help in setting reasonable expectations for response. Currently available treatment modalities on average result in only about a 30 percent decrease in pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. But even a partial response of 30 percent can be clinically significant and improve the patient's quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H335588739\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGIC OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic approaches are the most widely used therapeutic options to ameliorate persistent pain.

However, there are relatively few studies specifically evaluating combinations of drugs for chronic pain. Treatment response differs between individuals, and no one approach is appropriate for all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Comorbidities should be evaluated and treated. In particular, major depression and chronic pain frequently coexist, and both conditions must be addressed to maximize the treatment response for either disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Much of what is practiced in the management of chronic pain comes from experience with cancer pain. The World Health Organization's (WHO) &quot;analgesic ladder&quot; approach to cancer pain management, which was originally published in the mid-1980s, outlines an approach to pain control that is based upon the severity of pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63298\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63298 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The WHO analgesic ladder should not be viewed as evidence-based or a best practice guideline, but it has widely influenced cancer pain management, and many of the strategies are used in nonmalignant pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management: General principles and risk management for patients receiving opioids&quot;, section on 'General principles of pain management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H185828296\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF THERAPY BY TYPE OF PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of an appropriate initial therapeutic strategy is dependent upon an accurate evaluation of the cause of the pain and the type of chronic pain syndrome. In particular, neuropathic pain should be distinguished from nociceptive pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of chronic pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Neuropathic pain, resulting from damage to or pathology within the nervous system, can be central or peripheral. Causes of neuropathic pain are multiple, and include diabetes mellitus, postherpetic neuralgia, and stroke. Nociceptive pain, in contrast, is caused by stimuli that threaten or provoke actual tissue damage. Nociceptive pain is often due to musculoskeletal conditions, inflammation, or <span class=\"nowrap\">mechanical/compressive</span> problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H185828303\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuropathic pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial management of the patient with neuropathic pain involves establishing a diagnosis, whenever possible, and pursuing treatment targeted to the specific diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Thus, if nerve function is impaired by compression or drugs, alleviating the compression or removing the offending agent, if accomplished early enough, may be all that is needed.</p><p>When pharmacologic management of chronic neuropathic pain is required, the choice of an initial agent will be guided by individual patient factors including the pathophysiology of the pain syndrome, other symptoms and comorbidities, other medications being taken, organ reserves, <span class=\"nowrap\">pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics,</span> and the likelihood of adverse effects.</p><p>For most patients, the initial treatment of neuropathic pain involves either antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants or dual reuptake inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine) or calcium channel alpha 2-delta ligands (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>), with adjunctive topical therapy (eg, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>) when pain is localized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58265\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef58265 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Opioids should be considered a second-line option. They may be considered earlier in the treatment of select patients, such as those with severe intractable pain, episodic exacerbations of severe pain, or neuropathic cancer pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a 2013 Cochrane review of 31 trials of opioids for neuropathic pain, there was equivocal evidence of efficacy after short-term (less than 24 hours) opioid treatment; intermediate (less than 12 weeks) treatment was effective (33 percent pain relief in 57 percent of patients compared with 34 percent with placebo), but risk of bias in the studies was high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Combination therapy is often required, because less than half of patients with neuropathic pain will respond to a single agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, evidence is scant regarding the efficacy and safety of combination treatment.</p><p>Certain medications may be indicated for the treatment of specific causes of neuropathic pain. For example, first-line treatment for trigeminal neuralgia is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxcarbazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxcarbazepine</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigeminal-neuralgia#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trigeminal neuralgia&quot;, section on 'Medical therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Evidence-based guidelines have been developed by several groups, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG) &ndash; These guidelines, developed by a consensus process involving an international group of pain experts, are endorsed by the American Pain Society, the Canadian Pain Society, the Finnish Pain Society, the Latin American Federation of IASP Chapters, and the Mexican Pain Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) &ndash; Guidelines for the treatment of patients with neuropathic pain were updated in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Canadian Pain Society &ndash; These guidelines were developed concurrently with the initial guidelines from the EFNS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN), the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM), and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (AAPMR) &ndash; These guidelines are targeted to the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p>Given the limitations of the available evidence, specific drug recommendations for the pharmacologic treatment of neuropathic pain vary between these multiple guidelines. Most studies of pharmacologic therapy for neuropathic pain have focused on monotherapy for a specific etiology (eg, postherpetic neuralgia or painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy). There are few head-to-head comparisons of drugs, so that estimates of relative drug efficacies are based upon comparative response rates between studies and are inaccurate. Additionally, study duration is typically limited (six to eight weeks), which may inadequately reflect response over time for a chronic condition.</p><p>However, there is general agreement about the classes of drugs that have proven efficacy and should be considered for first-line or subsequent therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. There is consensus among the guidelines that first-line agents include either calcium channel alpha 2-delta ligands (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>) or tricyclic antidepressants. Serotonin norepinephrine uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are identified as either first or second-line agents, although they may be preferred to tricyclic antidepressants. Among the tricyclic antidepressants, side effect profiles appear to favor the secondary amine tricyclics (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a>), although the efficacy is the same for other tricyclics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H185828310\"><span class=\"h2\">Nociceptive pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to neuropathic pain, the pharmacologic approach to nociceptive pain primarily involves nonnarcotic and opioid analgesia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71075\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71075 \">algorithm 2</a>). Medication is used in conjunction with nonpharmacologic therapies and approaches to relieve the source of the pain.</p><p>When pharmacotherapy for nociceptive pain is required, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> is typically recommended as a first-line therapy for pain related to osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>] and chronic low back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, acetaminophen is less effective than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>] and has the potential for hepatic toxicity at doses of &gt;4 g per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>An alternative first line agent is an oral NSAID, which is effective for mild-to-moderate chronic low back pain or osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Opioid medications should be used on a chronic basis only in patients who are assessed to be at low risk for substance abuse, and who have persistent pain despite trials of nonopioid analgesics and antidepressants. It should be recognized that the evidence for the effectiveness of long-term opioid therapy in terms of pain relief and improved functional outcomes is limited, and that the risk of opioid overdose increases with increasing dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

SCS is a minimally invasive and reversible treatment option which can be permanently implanted after an appropriately conducted temporary screening trial with an external pulse generator to assess therapeutic efficacy and adverse effects. In the United States, the most common indication for spinal cord stimulator placement is chronic pain from failed back surgery syndrome. SCS may also be used for complex regional pain syndrome, intractable angina, and painful peripheral vascular disease.

A pharmacologic agent is then deposited, usually glucocorticoid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> local anesthetic.

Medication should not be the sole focus of treatment but should be used when needed, in conjunction with other treatment modalities, to meet treatment goals. (See <a href=\"#H185827432\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the patient'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of an appropriate initial therapeutic strategy is dependent upon an accurate evaluation of the cause of the pain and the type of chronic pain syndrome. In particular, neuropathic pain should be distinguished from nociceptive pain. For most patients, the initial treatment of neuropathic pain involves either antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants or dual reuptake inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine) or calcium channel alpha 2-delta ligands (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>), with adjunctive topical therapy when pain is localized. Opioid medications and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a> are second-line agents for most patients with neuropathic pain. In contrast, the pharmacologic approach to nociceptive pain primarily involves nonnarcotic and opioid analgesia. (See <a href=\"#H185828296\" class=\"local\">'Choice of therapy by type of pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonopioid analgesics include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, &quot;traditional&quot; nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70067\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70067 \">table 1</a>). Acetaminophen is not as effective as NSAIDs for the treatment of knee and hip pain related to osteoarthritis and may cause hepatic damage in patients with underlying liver disease or at higher doses. NSAIDs should be avoided in older adults when possible.
