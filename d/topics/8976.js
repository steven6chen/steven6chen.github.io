Individuals who have had two or more unprovoked epileptic seizures are more likely to continue to have seizures. Seizures are disruptive in a patient's life and can cause injury. Epilepsy is associated with disability, adverse psychosocial outcomes, higher rates of psychiatric comorbidity, and an approximately threefold increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comorbidities-and-complications-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comorbidities and complications of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The management of patients with epilepsy is focused on three main goals: controlling seizures, avoiding or minimizing treatment side effects, and maintaining or restoring quality of life. The initial treatment of epilepsy is with a single antiseizure drug. With an ever-expanding list of available antiseizure drugs, and no single antiseizure drug that is clearly superior in terms of efficacy or tolerability, clinicians must individualize the choice of antiseizure drug for each patient.</p><p>This topic will discuss the approach to the initial treatment of epilepsy. Other topics discuss the evaluation of patients with seizures and epilepsy, other aspects of epilepsy therapy, and features of specific antiseizure drugs.

The main factors to consider in making the decision are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk for recurrent seizures, which varies based on clinical factors discussed below (see <a href=\"#H845121616\" class=\"local\">'Risk of seizure recurrence'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approximate benefit that can be expected from immediate antiseizure drug therapy on the risk of recurrent seizure (see <a href=\"#H845122419\" class=\"local\">'Benefit of early versus deferred treatment'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The side effect profiles of various antiseizure drug options, which vary based on individual patient comorbidities and age (see <a href=\"#H1016716326\" class=\"local\">'Side effect profiles'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Comorbid medical conditions'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient values and preferences, particularly with regard to the social consequences of a recurrent seizure (eg, implications for driving or employment) (see <a href=\"#H845122419\" class=\"local\">'Benefit of early versus deferred treatment'</a> below)</p><p/><p>An evidence-based guideline of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society on the management of an unprovoked first seizure in adults also advocates for an individualized approach that weighs the risk of seizure recurrence against the adverse effects of antiseizure drugs and considers educated patient preferences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The guideline offers the following specific recommendations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults with an unprovoked first seizure should be informed that their seizure recurrence risk is greatest early within the first two years (21 to 45 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical variables associated with an increased risk may include a prior brain insult, an EEG with epileptiform abnormalities, a significant brain imaging abnormality, and a nocturnal seizure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate antiseizure drug therapy, as compared with delay of treatment pending a second seizure, is likely to reduce recurrence risk within the first two years but may not improve quality of life. Over a longer term (&gt;3 years), immediate antiseizure drug treatment is unlikely to improve prognosis as measured by sustained seizure remission.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be advised that the risk of antiseizure drug adverse events may range from 7 to 31 percent and that these adverse events are likely predominantly mild and reversible.</p><p/><p>In patients with a first unprovoked seizure who are found to have a CNS abnormality on neuroimaging (such as a brain tumor or scar tissue from an old head injury or CNS infection), the risk of seizure recurrence is high. In this instance, most clinicians would start treatment after the <strong>first</strong> unprovoked seizure. In fact, such patients likely have a sufficiently high risk of seizure recurrence to meet criteria for epilepsy according to International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These criteria now consider patients with a single unprovoked seizure and an estimated risk of recurrence &ge;60 percent over ten years to have epilepsy, similar to those with two unprovoked seizures occurring &gt;24 hours apart. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H845121616\" class=\"local\">'Risk of seizure recurrence'</a> below.)</p><p>In contrast are patients with a first unprovoked seizure who have a normal (or nonfocal) examination and normal (or nonspecific) neuroimaging. In these patients, the risk of seizure recurrence is lower, and antiseizure drug therapy may be reasonably deferred until after a second unprovoked seizure.</p><p>Patient concerns also weigh heavily in treatment decisions. If the risk of seizure recurrence is low, and the individual places a high value on avoidance of side effects, antiseizure drug therapy may be delayed. In contrast, there are some individuals who will be very concerned about seizure recurrence. In this instance, an antiseizure drug may be initiated to reduce seizure recurrence, despite what may be a low likelihood of additional seizures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H845121616\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk of seizure recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In prospective, randomized trials of individuals with a first unprovoked seizure, the estimated two-year recurrence risk in untreated patients ranges from 40 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The risk of recurrence is highest in the first year after the seizure and diminishes with time; 80 to 90 percent of patients who have recurrent seizures do so within two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>The most replicated clinical factors associated with an increased risk for seizure recurrence after a first unprovoked seizure include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/4-7,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7,9-11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epileptiform abnormalities on EEG (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electroencephalography (EEG) in the diagnosis of seizures and epilepsy&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remote symptomatic cause, as identified by clinical history or neuroimaging (eg, brain tumor, brain malformation, head injury with loss of consciousness, prior central nervous system infection)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal neurologic examination, including focal findings and intellectual disability</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A first seizure that occurs during sleep (ie, a nocturnal seizure)</p><p/><p>Each of these factors has been associated with an approximately 2- to 2.5-fold increased risk for recurrent seizure in studies that have included a mix of antiseizure drug-treated and untreated patients. There is a lack of evidence regarding interactions among various risk factors, and there is no formula available for determining additive risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Other potential risk factors for seizure recurrence have been investigated and remain more uncertain. As an example, patients who have a first presentation with status epilepticus or with multiple seizures within a single day are more likely to be treated with antiseizure drugs than are those with a single short-duration seizure. However, limited data suggest that presentation with status epilepticus, in the absence of other risk factors, does not increase the risk of seizure recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/6,7,9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,9,12</a>]. Similarly, whether a history of prior febrile seizures is associated with an increased risk of seizure recurrence after a first unprovoked afebrile seizure is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/6,7,9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,9,11</a>].</p><p>Study results have conflicted as to whether a family history of epilepsy impacts recurrence risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/5-7,9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7,9,11</a>]. This varies according to the epilepsy syndrome, since several epilepsy syndromes have been identified as monogenetic in origin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H845122419\"><span class=\"h3\">Benefit of early versus deferred treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For adults presenting with an unprovoked first seizure, immediate antiseizure drug treatment reduces the risk of seizure recurrence by about 35 percent over the next one to two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/4,5,10,13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,10,13-17</a>]. This estimate is derived from a meta-analysis of five randomized trials (n = 1600 patients) comparing immediate versus delayed antiseizure drug therapy in adults with an unprovoked first seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>However, studies suggest that starting an antiseizure drug has little impact on long-term outcome. At four and five years after the first seizure, patients have similar rates of complete seizure remission whether antiseizure drug treatment was initiated immediately after the first seizure or deferred until a second seizure occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/4,5,10,13,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,10,13,17</a>]. At least one randomized trial found that 20-year mortality was not impacted by immediate versus deferred treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In the aggregate, quality of life outcomes, as measured in one randomized study, were not different with early versus deferred treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, the questionnaires demonstrated significant tradeoffs between the adverse effects of seizures versus adverse effects of taking antiseizure drugs, suggesting that individual patient preferences should be considered. As one example, patients randomized to early antiseizure drug treatment were more likely to be able to drive than patients whose treatment was deferred. A need to drive or operate heavy machinery along with other occupational and psychological consequences of suffering a recurrent seizure are important considerations when deciding whether to start antiseizure drug therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H845121374\"><span class=\"h2\">Second unprovoked seizure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients presenting with a second unprovoked seizure should be started on antiseizure drug therapy, since seizure recurrence indicates that the patient has a substantially increased risk for additional seizures (ie, epilepsy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>].</p><p>In one prospective case series, the risk of another seizure after two unprovoked seizures was 73 percent at four years (most of these patients were treated with antiseizure drugs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In many cases, a careful history may reveal that certain seizure types such as typical absence, myoclonic, simple or complex partial have been recurrent at the time of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H845121380\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute symptomatic seizure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute symptomatic seizures have a lower risk for subsequent epilepsy compared with remote symptomatic seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Early management decisions, including whether or not to start an antiseizure drug, depend upon multiple factors, including the severity of the underlying illness, the cause and duration of the seizure, the expected risk of early recurrence, and the risks associated with a recurrent seizure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults&quot;, section on 'Acute symptomatic seizures'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with seizures that occur in the setting of acute neurologic illness or injury (eg, stroke, traumatic brain injury, meningitis, anoxic encephalopathy), particularly when severe, are often treated with antiseizure drugs in the acute setting because of the risk of prolonged recurrent seizures or aggravation of a systemic injury.

In contrast to the setting of an acute stroke or traumatic brain injury, patients with seizures provoked by metabolic derangements are generally not felt to be at risk for future epilepsy, but they are at risk for seizure recurrence in the acute setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Short-term antiseizure drug therapy may be indicated if the metabolic disturbance is expected to persist or if the initial seizure is prolonged (as in the instance of status epilepticus).

In general, but with some exceptions, the newer antiseizure drugs are superior with respect to tolerability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Meta-analyses of randomized trials can potentially overcome some of the limitations of individual trials, but even these studies can be problematic, since patient populations and drug doses often vary between trials; this substantively limits the ability to compare the studied treatments. In general, such studies have lacked power either to refute or substantively confirm results of individual trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/47-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-51</a>].</p><p>The largest individual randomized trial examining different antiseizure drugs as monotherapy for the initial treatment of epilepsy was the Standard and New Antiepileptic Drugs (SANAD) trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>]. The SANAD trial included 1721 patients with focal epilepsy and 716 patients with generalized seizures.

The treating physician determined how quickly to titrate the medication, instead of following a standardized blinded protocol. This approach may have better approximated the &quot;real life&quot; use of these drugs than would a blinded trial. Outcome measures were time to treatment failure (for either inadequate seizure control or intolerable side effects) and time to achievement of a 12-month seizure remission.

This tool can be accessed from the UpToDate online search page or through the individual drug information topics in the section on Drug interactions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, antiseizure drugs with hepatic enzyme induction or inhibitory properties have the greatest potential for interactions. Enzyme induction occurs with all older antiseizure drugs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>) except <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethosuximide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethosuximide</a>.

As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> induces the metabolism of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, potentially leading to subtherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an increased dose requirement of warfarin. Commonly prescribed drugs with the potential to interact with enzyme-inducing antiseizure drugs include statins, calcium channel blockers, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, hormonal contraceptive therapy, warfarin, and many anticancer drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> is a hepatic enzyme inhibitor and may cause significant increases in serum concentrations of medications that are metabolized in the liver.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other drug interactions relate to protein binding. Addition of a drug that is highly protein-bound will displace another protein-bound drug, increasing its free fraction. In the setting of reduced serum albumin, this effect is amplified. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lamotrigine</a> concentrations are reduced by estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives.

In addition, polypharmacy is more often a concern in older adults. These and other factors related to antiseizure drug selection in older adults are discussed separately.

In other words, higher doses of lamotrigine may be needed in women taking combined estrogen-progesterone contraception, and continuous dosing may be preferable to avoid increased lamotrigine levels during pill-free intervals.

Catamenial seizure clustering can occur in women with any seizure type and epilepsy syndrome but may be more common among women with focal compared with generalized epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/127-132\" class=\"abstract_t\">127-132</a>] and among those with left-sided temporal epilepsy compared with right-sided, multifocal, or extratemporal epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/133,134\" class=\"abstract_t\">133,134</a>].</p><p>In general, research suggests that catamenial seizure patterns result from cyclic changes in hormone levels during the menstrual cycle; changes in antiseizure drug levels due to endogenous metabolic effects may also contribute. Estrogen levels peak mid-cycle and then, in women who do not conceive, fall through the onset of menses. It is during the late part of the menstrual cycle (just before the onset of menses), during a relative drop in estrogen levels, that seizures most often cluster [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/127,135\" class=\"abstract_t\">127,135</a>]. Periovulatory (mid-cycle) seizure clustering can also occur.</p><p>The mainstay of treatment of catamenial seizures is an antiseizure drug that is most effective for the woman's epilepsy syndrome. However, when catamenial seizures are not controlled with antiseizure drugs, clinicians may consider use of a continuous estrogen-progestin contraceptive on the theoretical basis that suppressing estrogen fluctuations will lead to better seizure control. The rationale and use of hormonal prophylaxis for catamenial epilepsy is similar to that in estrogen-associated migraine, which is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrogen-associated-migraine#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Estrogen-associated migraine&quot;, section on 'Hormone-based interventions'</a>.)</p><p>Intermittent benzodiazepine treatment timed according to the vulnerable phase of the menstrual cycle is also a common strategy. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobazam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clobazam</a> is the only benzodiazepine studied systematically for this purpose. In a double-blind cross-over study, clobazam (20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> was administered for 10 days in the high risk phase of the menstrual cycle in 18 women with catamenial epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>]. Fourteen patients reported better seizure control with clobazam than placebo.

These limited data support a fairly common practice of treating catamenial seizure exacerbations with intermittent benzodiazepines with a long-acting agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>. A reasonable dose of lorazepam in this setting is 0.5 to 1 mg two to three times daily.</p><p>Very limited data suggest that appropriately timed <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a> may have some benefit in catamenial epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/138-140\" class=\"abstract_t\">138-140</a>].

Seizures, particularly convulsive seizures, are believed to be harmful to the fetus. At the same time, both major and minor malformations are more common in fetuses exposed to antiseizure drugs in utero compared with offspring of untreated women with epilepsy and women without epilepsy. The overall risk of major malformations is 4 to 6 percent in exposed infants; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> is a major contributor to this risk. Polypharmacy increases the risk. The timing (early versus late in gestation) and dose of exposure are also likely to be important. While no antiseizure drug has been definitively shown to be safe in pregnancy, the evidence linking valproate to fetal malformations is sufficiently convincing to recommend avoiding its initiation and use in most women of childbearing potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>].
