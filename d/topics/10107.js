Peripheral artery disease, alone or in combination with diabetes mellitus, contributes more than half of all amputations; trauma is the second leading cause. The second Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus Working group (TASC II) documented an incidence of major amputations due to peripheral artery disease ranging from 12 to 50 per 100,000 individuals per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-amputation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The aging population is expected to increase this number by 50 percent in the next 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-amputation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Factors that predict the need for lower extremity amputation in patients with extremity ischemia include tissue loss, end-stage renal disease, poor functional status, and diabetes mellitus. Patients with diabetes have a 10-fold increased risk for lower extremity amputation compared with those who do not have diabetes. Amputees with diabetes are more likely to be severely disabled, to experience their initial amputation at a younger age, progress to higher-level amputations, and die at a younger age compared with patients without diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-amputation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>The indications and techniques for lower extremity amputation, postoperative care, complications, and outcomes are reviewed here.

Identification of medical risk factors and appropriate pre- and postoperative medical care may decrease the rate of perioperative complications. In a five-year retrospective study, higher modified frailty index scores were predictors of 30-day readmission after lower extremity amputation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-amputation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Although preservation of limb length is desirable, removal of all nonviable and infected tissue is a higher priority. </p><p>The surgeon must be satisfied that sufficient arterial perfusion is present at the proposed amputation level to sustain healing. The level of amputation is determined by a combination of a thorough physical examination supplemented by objective testing in patients with clinical symptoms and signs of lower extremity ischemia. In one study, 68.4 percent of patients underwent objective arterial testing prior to nontraumatic amputation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-amputation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Older age, male sex, black race, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, known peripheral artery disease, evaluation by a vascular specialist, and living in the East North Central region were associated with greater rates of preoperative arterial testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive diagnosis of arterial disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Determination of amputation level by means of physical examination and clinical judgement alone results in healing in 80 percent of below-knee amputations (BKAs) and 90 percent of above-knee amputations (AKAs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-amputation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The presence of a palpable pulse proximal to the level of amputation is associated with a healing rate of nearly 100 percent. The absence of a palpable pulse does not necessarily imply wound healing failure of the amputation stump; however, the rate of revision following major amputation may be higher. </p><p>Various objective tests can supplement the clinical examination to assist the choice of amputation level. These include ankle pressures, toe pressures, transcutaneous oxygen measurements, and skin perfusion pressure. The sensitivity of these studies for predicting wound healing is low, ranging from 60 to 74 percent, and thus, these tests should not be used to replace clinical judgement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-amputation/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p>It is also important that structural integrity of the bony architecture of the residual limb is adequate. As an example, for some patients with diabetes and Charcot&rsquo;s degenerative osteoarthropathy of the foot, ongoing instability of the metatarsals may favor transtibial amputation over complex foot salvage procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1576691569\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lower extremity amputation is often associated with open, infected wounds and thus, are classified as contaminated or dirty, and associated with a high risk for surgical site infection. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for all patients within one hour of the skin incision for lower extremity amputation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87206 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-amputation/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

In the largest of the randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-amputation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], a significantly lower incidence of wound infection was found in 77 patients treated with prophylactic antibiotics (38 versus 17 percent) compared with 75 treated with placebo; similar results were found in the smaller trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-amputation/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Among the studies comparing various antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-amputation/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>], (methicillin versus cephalothin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G</a> versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefuroxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefuroxime</a>, benzyl penicillin versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> + clavulanic acid), a significant difference in the incidence of wound infection was found only for benzyl penicillin versus amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (77 versus 13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-amputation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Intravenous prophylactic antibiotics appropriate for skin flora are adequate for amputation that is not complicated by lower extremity soft tissue wound infection or gangrene. If any of these conditions are present, broad spectrum perioperative antibiotics should be administered. Anaerobic coverage should be considered for diabetics. </p><p>Surveys of the bacteriology of amputation wound infections confirm a wide spectrum of aerobic and anaerobic species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-amputation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. One study found a significant reduction in amputation wound infection (22.5 to 5 percent) for patients receiving a prophylactic five-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics compared with a three-dose regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-amputation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, the incidence of Clostridia difficile colon infection was higher (7.5 versus 0 percent) for those receiving the five-day course of antibiotics.</p><p>Antibiotics are continued in the postoperative period in patients undergoing staged debriding amputation for infection or gangrene. Broad spectrum antibiotics are selected in accordance with the local antibiogram and adjusted in response to wound culture and sensitivities.

Patients undergoing major lower extremity amputation are at high risk for thromboembolism due to the nature of the surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F83739\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83739 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-amputation/abstract/28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-32</a>]. In addition, most patients undergoing amputation at the transmetatarsal level will have weight-bearing restrictions and will be immobilized postoperatively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Indirect evidence from large randomized trials of other orthopedic surgeries (eg, knee replacement), and two small trials and other observational studies in patients undergoing major lower extremity amputation support thromboprophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-amputation/abstract/29,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,33-35</a>]. For all major lower extremity amputations, we recommend thromboprophylaxis because it reduces the incidence of venous thromboembolism. In older reviews, deep vein thrombosis is reported in up to 50 percent of patients following major lower extremity amputation without prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-amputation/abstract/30,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32</a>].

In a randomized trial that compared low molecular weight heparin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> for prophylaxis, the incidence of DVT was 10 percent with no differences between the groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-amputation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1576691758\"><span class=\"h1\">AMPUTATION TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Major amputations include hip disarticulation, above-knee amputation (AKA), knee disarticulation, and below-knee amputation (BKA). A variety of foot amputations are available that can salvage the patient&rsquo;s ability to ambulate with orthotic modifications including mid- and hindfoot amputation (eg, Lisfranc, Chopart, Syme), transmetatarsal amputation, and digit amputations. Major amputation and foot amputation techniques are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Drains placed into the wound at the time of the surgery are maintained until volume in the drain reservoir is minimal; thereafter, the drain can be removed. </p><p>Open wounds (eg, open amputation, soft tissue defect, stump breakdown) are managed with moist saline dressings. Once the wounds have stabilized and no necrotic debris is apparent, negative pressure wound therapy may be useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-amputation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

For patients who were not dialysis dependent but had a preoperative<sup> </sup>serum<sup> </sup>creatinine &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> one-year survival was not significantly different (56 versus 52 percent) compared with dialysis-dependent<sup> </sup>patients. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H614730646\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower extremity amputation is indicated for a variety of reasons to remove ischemic, infected, or necrotic tissue, or locally unresectable tumor, and at times, may be lifesaving. Peripheral artery disease and diabetes are the leading causes of nontraumatic lower extremity amputation in the United States. (See <a href=\"#H614727678\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1576671063\" class=\"local\">'Indications for amputation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to amputation, medical, prosthetic, rehabilitation, and, potentially, psychological consultation should be obtained. (See <a href=\"#H614727885\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation and preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The level of the amputation is dictated by the extent of the disease, healing potential of the stump and rehabilitation potential of the patient. The presence of a palpable pulse proximal to the level of amputation is associated with a healing rate of nearly 100 percent, but the absence of a palpable pulse does not imply that the incision will not heal. Although various objective tests can supplement the clinical examination, these tests have a wide variability in their sensitivity and should not be used to replace good clinical judgement. (See <a href=\"#H614727913\" class=\"local\">'Level of amputation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients undergoing lower extremity amputation who are not already receiving antibiotics for associated soft tissue infection, we recommend perioperative prophylactic antibiotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Prophylactic antibiotics significantly reduce the incidence of amputation wound infection. The choice of antibiotic therapy and duration depend upon the clinical situation. (See <a href=\"#H1576691569\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Antimicrobial prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend thromboprophylaxis for all patients undergoing major lower extremity amputation (transtibial and above) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Patients undergoing major lower extremity amputation are at high risk for thromboembolism. Without prophylaxis, deep vein thrombosis has been reported in up to 50 percent of patients following major lower extremity amputation. Pharmacologic prophylaxis reduces the incidence of DVT to approximately 10 percent (See <a href=\"#H1576691576\" class=\"local\">'Thromboprophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications following lower extremity amputation are common and include medical complications related to preexisting conditions and local complications related to the surgery, which include stump hematoma, infection, need for repeat amputation, phantom limb syndrome and flexion contracture. The need for re-amputation at a more proximal level is inversely related to the level of the index amputation, with more proximal amputations less likely to require revision. (See <a href=\"#H614729032\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perioperative mortality rates for major amputation in patients with peripheral artery disease range from 3 to 18 percent and are related to the patient&rsquo;s medical comorbidities (eg, cardiac disease, pulmonary disease). Mortality is 11 to 18 percent for above-knee (AKA) amputation, 4 to 9 percent for below-knee amputation (BKA), and 2 to 7 percent for foot amputation (total or partial). Mortality related directly to the operation is less common. Mortality rates for amputation performed for nonvascular indications are lower. (See <a href=\"#H614729088\" class=\"local\">'Perioperative mortality'</a> above and <a href=\"#H614729104\" class=\"local\">'Long-term survival'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with diabetes have a 10-fold increased risk for lower extremity amputation compared with those who do not have diabetes, and patients with diabetes are almost twice as likely to require re-amputation as patients without diabetes. Long-term mean survival is also reduced in patients with diabetes. (See <a href=\"#H614727678\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1576717368\" class=\"local\">'Need for re-amputation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H614729088\" class=\"local\">'Perioperative mortality'</a> above and <a href=\"#H614729104\" class=\"local\">'Long-term survival'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-amputation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Norgren L, Hiatt WR, Dormandy JA, et al.
