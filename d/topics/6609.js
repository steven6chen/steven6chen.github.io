The disorder was first described by James Parkinson in his 1817 Essay on the Shaking Palsy. Although it has been proposed that PD emerged as a result of the industrial revolution, there is some evidence that a disease known as &quot;kampavata,&quot; consisting of shaking (kampa) and lack of muscular movement (vata), existed in ancient Indian medical system, Ayurveda, as long as 4500 years ago [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The Mucuna pruriens plant was used in ancient times to treat the symptoms, and was later discovered to contain levodopa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The pathology of PD was not well understood until the early 20th century, when the German pathologist Frederick Lewy in 1912 reported neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions in a variety of brain regions. In 1919, Tretiakoff observed that the most critical abnormality in PD was the loss of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the midbrain. In the 1950s, investigators discovered the importance of dopamine and its depletion from the basal ganglia as the key to understanding the pathophysiology and pathologic biochemistry of PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>While the cause of PD is still unknown, remarkable advances have been made in understanding the possible underlying mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This extraordinary progress has been fueled by new discoveries about the anatomy and function of the basal ganglia, improved characterization of neuropathologic and neurochemical abnormalities in PD, and by studies of genetic and experimental forms of parkinsonism.</p><p>This topic will review the etiology and pathogenesis of PD. Clinical issues related to PD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Parkinson disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic treatment of Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dopamine depletion from the basal ganglia results in major disruptions in the connections to the thalamus and motor cortex, and leads to parkinsonian signs such as bradykinesia.</p><p>A number of compensatory mechanisms may operate to mask or reduce the deleterious effects of dopamine depletion, particularly in the presymptomatic phase of PD, but they are eventually overwhelmed by disease progression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Basal ganglia circuits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basal ganglia, sometimes referred to as the extrapyramidal system, include the substantia nigra (SN), striatum (caudate and putamen), globus pallidus (GP), subthalamic nucleus (STN), and thalamus.</p><p>The cortical input to the basal ganglia from the prefrontal supplementary motor area, amygdala and hippocampus is excitatory, mediated by the neurotransmitter glutamate. Neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) provide major dopaminergic input to the striatum and exert both excitatory and inhibitory influences on the striatal output neurons. The interaction between the afferent and efferent pathways is mediated by striatal interneurons which utilize acetylcholine as the main neurotransmitter.</p><p>The striatal output system is mediated by the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino-butyric-acid (GABA). The connection between the STN and the internal (medial) globus pallidus (GPi) and between STN and the lateral (or external) globus pallidus (GPe) is excitatory, mediated by glutamate.</p><p>Five distinct dopamine receptors (D1 through D5) have been cloned and characterized; they are found throughout the basal ganglia and limbic system. The D1 and D2 receptors are highly concentrated in the dorsal (motor) striatum and are the most relevant to the pathophysiology of PD because they are activated by the dopaminergic pathway originating in the SNc and terminating in the caudate and putamen. Receptors designated as D3, D4, and D5 are more abundant in the mesolimbic or emotional part of the brain (D3, D4) and <span class=\"nowrap\">hippocampus/hypothalamus</span> (D5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Dopamine deficiency in the nigrostriatal pathway, such as seen in PD, causes denervation hypersensitivity of D1 and D2 receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. When compared with normal matched controls, D2 receptors in the dorsal putamen are increased by 15 percent in patients with PD, whereas D3 receptors in the mesolimbic system are decreased by 40 to 45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These results may explain the basis for the hypersensitivity of the nigrostriatal (D2) dopaminergic receptors that is observed in PD.</p><p>There are two output pathways from the striatum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F82136\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82136 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The indirect pathway is mediated chiefly via dopamine's inhibitory influence on striatal D2 dopamine receptors. In the indirect pathway, the striatum projects to the neurons in the lateral GP (GPe) utilizing GABA, and the GPe in turn projects to the STN, which provides excitatory input via glutamate to the internal segment of the GP (GPi) and SN pars reticulata (SNr). GPi neurons are GABAergic and synapse in the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus. Thalamic input to the cortex is excitatory.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The direct pathway is mediated via dopamine's excitatory influence on striatal D1 dopamine receptors. In the direct pathway, the striatum projects directly to the GPi and SNr.</p><p/><p>In PD, a reduction of dopamine-producing neurons from the normal complement of approximately 550,000 to the critically low level of 100,000 leads to dopamine depletion in the SN and in the nigrostriatal pathway to the caudate and putamen. This, in turn, results in relative overactivity of the indirect pathway, functionally disinhibiting the STN. Decreased inhibition of the direct pathway causes additional disinhibition of the output nuclei (GPi and SNr). Increased output from GPi causes increased inhibition of the thalamus and reduced excitatory input to the motor cortex, which is ultimately expressed as bradykinesia and other parkinsonian signs.</p><p>In PD, synchronized oscillatory activity in the 10 to 50 Hz band (often termed the beta-band), prevalent in the basal ganglia thalamocortical circuit, may be important in mediating certain parkinsonian features, including bradykinesia and tremor, and can be reduced by dopaminergic treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Therefore, surgical treatments of PD, such as lesion placement within or stimulation of GPi or STN, may act by desynchronizing the oscillatory basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical network activity.</p><p>Models of basal ganglia dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F82136\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82136 \">figure 1</a>) are useful for conceptualizing how the motor symptoms of PD arise. However, the actual pathophysiology of the basal ganglia associated with PD is much more complex than indicated by the current models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Existing models should be constantly reevaluated as new findings become available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Compensatory mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The brain has a remarkable capacity to compensate for the presynaptic dopamine depletion by increasing the synthesis of dopamine in surviving neurons and by increasing the afferents to the dendrites of dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, dopaminergic denervation has been shown to result in a proliferation of D2 receptors, as well as a co-localization of D1 and D2 receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Similarly, gap junctions, which allow rapid communications between striatal neurons, increase dramatically after dopaminergic denervation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In the brains of patients with PD, the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-staining neurons in the striatum is markedly decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Since tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of dopamine, is still present in surviving neurons, the synthesis of dopamine could be increased in these striatal neurons, thereby compensating for the presynaptic dopamine loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Another compensatory mechanism may be downregulation of the dopamine transporter, resulting in less dopamine reuptake and higher synaptic dopamine levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Three stages of compensation during the presymptomatic period of PD have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An early period during which the dopamine homeostatic compensatory mechanisms discussed above are capable of &quot;masking&quot; the disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased activity of the basal ganglia output nuclei (eg, internal segment of the globus pallidus) as striatal dopamine homeostasis breaks down</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased intensity of compensation in structures outside of the basal ganglia (eg, supplementary motor area of the cortex) as parkinsonian motor abnormalities emerge</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depigmentation, neuronal loss, and gliosis, particularly in the substantia nigra pars compacta and in the pontine locus ceruleus, are typical abnormalities found in the brains of patients with PD. Neuronal degeneration is also present in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus in the medulla and other brainstem nuclei.</p><p>Using a quantitative method, one study of seven patients with PD and seven controls found that the number of pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra, normally 550,000, was reduced by 66 percent in those with PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, the number of nonpigmented neurons, normally 260,000, was reduced by 24 percent. By the time the first symptoms of PD emerge, about 60 percent of the neurons in the substantia nigra pars compact have been lost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The ventrolateral portion of the substantia nigra that projects to the dorsal putamen is preferentially affected early in the course of PD, resulting in the gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and a nearly complete depletion of dopamine, particularly in the putamen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This contrasts with normal aging, which is usually associated with neuronal loss in the dorsal tier of the substantia nigra pars compacta, and depletion of dopamine, predominantly in the caudate nucleus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Because of the apparent discrepancy between loss of striatal dopamine (&gt;80 percent) and the degree of loss of neurons in the substantia nigra (50 to 60 percent), some have suggested that the initial site of pathology is in the striatum and that retrograde degeneration may be responsible for the neuronal loss in the substantia nigra [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. An alternative explanation is that each dopaminergic neuron has multiple projections that terminate in the striatum, so that death of the cell body has a multiplying effect on loss of terminals.</p><p>In addition to the degeneration of the substantia nigra pars compacta, other nuclei are affected by the pathology of PD, including the internal segment of the globus pallidus, the center median-parafascicular complex, the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, and the glutamatergic caudal intralaminar thalamic nuclei [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Moreover, volumetric MRI studies have found significant hippocampal atrophy in patients with PD, with or without cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Lewy bodies and other intracellular inclusions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no consensus as to what pathologic criteria are necessary for the diagnosis of PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], but most investigators believe that Lewy bodies, named for Frederick Lewy, constitute the pathologic hallmark of PD.</p><p>Lewy bodies are round, eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic neuronal inclusions. They are 3 to 25 nm in diameter with a dense granular core (1 to 8 nm) and loosely arranged fibrillary elements extending towards a peripheral &quot;halo.&quot; Immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated that Lewy bodies are made up mainly of alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin, and also contain calbindin, complement proteins, microfilament subunits, tubulin, microtubule associated protein 1 and 2, and a parkin substrate protein called Pael-R [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, Lewy bodies do not contain the tau protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>As noted, Lewy bodies stain for alpha-synuclein, a 140 amino acid presynaptic protein found mutated in rare families with PD. Lewy bodies also contain synphilin-1 and other cytoskeletal proteins associated with alpha-synuclein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'SNCA-associated PD'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients with PD, Lewy bodies are seen in the substantia nigra, the basal nucleus of Meynert, locus ceruleus, cerebral cortex, sympathetic ganglia, the dorsal vagal nucleus, the myenteric plexus of the intestines, and even in the cardiac sympathetic plexus. Lewy bodies appear to arise from the peripheral portion of other inclusions known as pale bodies, which are found in the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Lewy bodies are not specific for PD, since they are found in as many as 10 percent of brains of normal older adults, and in patients with other neurodegenerative diseases, such as neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA), ataxia-telangiectasia, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, Down syndrome, and Alzheimer disease. There is growing evidence that Lewy bodies occur not only in synucleinopathies such as PD, or amyloidopathies such as Alzheimer disease, but also in tauopathies, such as frontotemporal dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The lack of specificity of the pathologic findings raises the possibility that PD may not be a specific disease entity, but rather a clinically prototypical syndrome with different clinical subtypes and pathogenic causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F80669\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80669 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Inclusions such as Lewy bodies have traditionally been considered toxic. However, some studies suggest that they may actually be neuroprotective, and that compounds that promote the formation of inclusions lessen the pathology of PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/23,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Braak staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the traditional view, the pathologic process of PD starts with degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. This view has been challenged by the neuropathologist Heiko Braak, who has proposed that the pathologic changes of PD start in the medulla of the brainstem and in the olfactory bulb, progressing rostrally over many years to the cerebral cortex in a predictable six-stage process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69456\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69456 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>According to Braak staging, the progression of pathologic changes occurs as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During presymptomatic stages 1 and 2, the pathologic changes are found in the medulla oblongata and olfactory bulb.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In stages 3 and 4, the pathology has migrated rostrally to the substantia nigra pars compacta and other neuronal clusters of the midbrain and basal forebrain, at which time the classic motor symptoms of PD first appear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In end-stages 5 and 6, the pathologic process encroaches upon the telencephalic cortex of the temporal and frontal lobes.</p><p/><p>However, the validity and predictive utility of Braak staging has been questioned, as there are no cell counts to correlate with the described synuclein pathology and no observed asymmetry in the pathologic findings that correlate with the well-recognized asymmetry of clinical findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>In addition, there is controversy as to the classification of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), considered by some to be a separate entity from PD. Braak did not include DLB his observations on the progression of PD.

The other mechanism of cell death, called autophagy, is characterized by accumulation of autophagic vesicles (autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes), and also plays an important role in neurodegeneration in PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>It has been suggested that only 0.5 percent of substantia nigra neurons in normal brains are undergoing apoptosis, but this number is increased fourfold to 2 percent in those with PD. Some experimental models of PD suggest that apoptosis is the primary mechanism of substantia nigra neuronal degeneration in PD, but convincing evidence from careful neuropathologic studies is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>Although the precise mechanisms of neurodegeneration in PD are not yet understood, they most likely involve a cascade of events that include interaction between genetic factors and abnormalities in protein processing, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, inflammation, immune regulation, glial-specific factors, lack of trophic factors, and other, yet unknown, mechanisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F82386\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82386 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F72207\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72207 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>One of the emerging hypotheses is that neurodegeneration in PD is due to disruption of intracellular vesicular transport as a result of destabilizing of microtubules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Another area of increasing interest is the role of astrocytes in various neurodegenerative disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Some have suggested that PD arises from a prenatal event or process that predisposes some individuals to have fewer dopaminergic neurons at the time of birth because of abnormalities in the genes that code for factors important in the development of the dopaminergic system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>As an example, it is possible that prenatal or early postnatal exposure to certain dopaminergic neuronal toxins, such as the MPTP-like herbicide paraquat and the manganese-containing fungicide maneb, may reduce the number of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra in early development and enhance vulnerability to these toxins when individuals are subsequently exposed in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

The degeneration actually begins in the dopaminergic nerve terminals in the central and dorsolateral striatum, leading to retrograde apoptotic death of the cell body. Rotenone infusion is associated with marked and uniform depletion of complex I in the brain and generation of reactive oxygen species, or oxygen-free radicals, resulting in oxidative damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. This can also lead to release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm and aggregation of proteins, such as alpha-synuclein, and formation of cytoplasmic inclusions.</p><p>The rotenone model provides support for the theory that neurodegeneration results from an interaction between environmental exposure and mitochondrial dysfunction.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Compensatory mechanisms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typical abnormalities found in the brains of patients with PD include depigmentation (from loss of neuromelanin), neuronal loss, and gliosis, particularly in the substantia nigra pars compacta and in the pontine locus ceruleus. Lewy bodies are round, eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusions in the nuclei of neurons that constitute the pathologic hallmark of PD. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The precise mechanisms of neurodegeneration in PD are not yet understood, but they most likely involve a cascade of events that include interaction between genetic and environmental factors, and abnormalities in protein processing, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, inflammation, immune regulation, and other mechanisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F82386\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82386 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F72207\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72207 \">figure 4</a>).

The prevalence of PD rises with age. Worldwide, there are approximately 7.5 million people with PD. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is consistent evidence that older age is associated with increased risk of PD, while cigarette smoking is a protective factor. Evidence supporting other potential risk factors for PD, including occupational exposures (eg, pesticides, herbicides, heavy metals), dietary factors, and body weight is inconclusive. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Associated factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the majority of cases of PD appear to be sporadic, there are genetic forms of parkinsonism (designated PARK1 through PARK13) related to nuclear and mitochondrial genes.
