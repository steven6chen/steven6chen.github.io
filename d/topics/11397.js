Musculoskeletal US can be used to assess soft tissues, cartilage, bone surfaces, and fluid-containing structures and is becoming more widely available for diagnostic and therapeutic use in outpatient settings, including rheumatology practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Among the major uses of US in the management of joint disorders and related conditions are image guidance of glucocorticoid injections and aspiration of joint effusions and other fluid collections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Among the possible advantages of US are the avoidance of the radiation exposure and inconvenience associated with use of fluoroscopy for procedures involving otherwise difficult-to-enter joints and other spaces, including the sacroiliac and hip joints, and small targets, including tendon sheaths, gouty tophi, and small effusions; procedures in patients with obscured surface landmarks such as morbidly obese patients; avoidance of critical structures like nerves or arteries; appropriate needle placement in particular conditions like hemophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]; and direct aspiration of Baker's cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The use of US imaging for joint, tendon, and bursal injections and for aspiration of fluid is discussed here. A review of the clinical applications of musculoskeletal US and the technical aspects of musculoskeletal US, including the validity and reliability of image acquisition and interpretation in rheumatic disorders, are addressed in detail separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasonography: Clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-nomenclature-technical-considerations-validation-and-standardization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasonography: Nomenclature, technical considerations, validation, and standardization&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The techniques and indications, medication regimens, and complications of joint aspiration or<strong> </strong>injection are also discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraarticular-and-soft-tissue-injections-what-agents-to-inject-and-how-frequently\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraarticular and soft tissue injections: What agent(s) to inject and how frequently?&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint aspiration or injection in adults: Complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint aspiration or injection in adults: Technique and indications&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18565970\"><span class=\"h1\">ACCURACY AND EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Needle placement based upon external landmarks alone is often inaccurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. The use of ultrasound (US) guidance for the injection and aspiration of joints and related structures improves the accuracy of such procedures, but evidence supporting improved efficacy and safety of therapeutic injections using US guidance is very limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/8,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11-13</a>]. Avoidance of vulnerable anatomic structures is facilitated by US visualization, and the use of US potentially reduces the likelihood of &ldquo;dry taps&rdquo; from the needle missing a small or sequestered fluid collection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/3,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14</a>]. US is able to detect volumes of synovial fluid in cadaver knees as small as 7.4 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>],<strong> </strong>but modern devices visualize fluid collections in ankle joints as small as 2 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18565977\"><span class=\"h2\">Accuracy of needle placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The inaccuracy of needle placement using external landmarks and palpation alone has been shown in a number of studies, and the accuracy obtained with US has been compared with injection without imaging and with other imaging techniques. In a study of 109 patients who received &quot;blind&quot; intraarticular injections of the shoulder or the knee, the accuracy was only 25 and 70 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Another study, which examined the accuracy of blind glenohumeral (GH) joint and subacromial bursal injections into 38 shoulders, found 42 and 29 percent accuracy, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The use of US may improve the accuracy of needle placement. Greater accuracy was found at multiple sites in a study comparing US-guided and blind needle placement in a total of 63 joints, including the shoulder, knee, ankle, and small joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Successful aspirations were more frequent using US guidance (97 versus 32 percent), although interpretation of the study data is limited by the fact that patients referred for US-guided aspiration who subsequently failed to show fluid were excluded from the study.</p><p>Accuracy of small joint aspiration from metacarpophalangeal or proximal interphalangeal joints is also greater with US-guidance than using a palpation-guided approach (96 versus 59 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Other studies have found comparable accuracy for US in comparison with computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the aspiration of joints, including the hips, or soft tissue masses at various skeletal sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18565984\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of accuracy on outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Higher accuracy of needle placement may improve clinical outcomes for peritendinous, bursal, or intraarticular injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/13,20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,20-23</a>]. The following examples demonstrate the range of benefits from greater accuracy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial compared US guidance and conventional palpation guidance for arthrocentesis and glucocorticoid injection in a variety of joints in 148 patients with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other conditions; the US guidance resulted in significant reductions in procedural pain and pain scores at two weeks (by 43 and 59 percent, respectively) and increased the rate of response (reduction in pain score of at least 50 percent) by 26 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. US increased the detection of effusions threefold and the volume of aspirated fluid by 337 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial of large and medium joint glucocorticoid injection in 184 patients showed greater accuracy using US guidance than with blind injection at multiple sites, including the knee (91 versus 82 percent), shoulder (63 versus 40 percent), wrist (79 versus 75 percent), ankle (85 versus 58 percent), and elbow (91 versus 64 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A significant improvement in joint function was noted for accurate injections compared with inaccurate injections, but, for other outcome measures, including pain and stiffness, no significant difference between the two groups was found.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial of US-guided intratenosynovial glucocorticoid injection versus a blind intramuscular steroid injection in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and active tenosynovitis showed a significantly better response to the US-guided injection compared with intramuscular steroid injection, both at 4- and 12-weeks follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study evaluating residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, with carpal tunnel syndrome, showed that ultrasound-guided injections were associated with a reduced chance of retreatment compared with blind injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p>Other studies have failed to show that greater accuracy improves outcomes. As an example, one study has shown that true intrasheath injection offers no advantage over subcutaneous injection in the treatment of trigger digits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. A study of 24 patients with recalcitrant plantar fasciitis did not show any difference in benefit between US-guided injections and conventional injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In addition, an MRI-based study of the accuracy of US-guided subacromial injections versus blind injections in a small number of patients did not show any difference between the two methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Further studies are needed to determine the degree of benefit, if any, regarding efficacy and improved clinical outcome from the use of US-guided needle placement for individual anatomic sites and indications. The other possible advantage (ie, avoidance of damage to critical structures), was demonstrated in a single study of 195 therapeutic soft tissue injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Again, compelling evidence from additional studies is required to corroborate these findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18565991\"><span class=\"h1\">TRAINING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of ultrasound (US) guidance for injection and aspiration of joints and related sites requires education and training. Courses are available for practitioners who have not received such instruction during their postgraduate medical training. Recommendations for the use of US guidance in the performance of the procedures outlined below, particularly when used for direct visualization during needle insertion, assume a sufficient level of experience and competence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18565998\"><span class=\"h1\">REQUIRED EQUIPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ultrasound (US) machine with a 7 to 15 MHz linear array broadband probe and a 5 MHz convex array probe is adequate for most studies. Either sterile or nonsterile US gel may be used. Furthermore, an array of needles together with T-connectors should be prepared depending upon the puncture site or specific procedure requested.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18566005\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE OF ULTRASOUND-GUIDED INJECTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two approaches to the use of ultrasound (US) guidance:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the skin marking or indirect approach, US is used to evaluate the anatomic characteristics of the area of interest prior to performing the procedure.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the direct approach, US visualization is used during the procedure.</p><p/><p>The direct approach requires greater training and experience to obtain competency with <span class=\"nowrap\">needle/probe</span> coordination. It also requires training in coordinated use of one hand for the US probe and the other for the needle and syringe. In addition, familiarity with the differences in the appearance of the needle in the longitudinal and transverse planes and the effects of needle positioning are required. The tip of the needle is clearly visible on the longitudinal image when the needle is parallel to the US beam (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74259\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74259 \">image 1</a>), but it appears as a tiny bright spot when the long axis of the transducer probe is transverse to the needle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F52095\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52095 \">image 2</a>). The ultrasonographer should not rely solely on the transverse image, as the tip often cannot be seen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18566012\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin surface marking or indirect approach</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18566021\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications for the indirect approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indirect approach is used to better define the anatomic location of an area to be injected or aspirated than can be accomplished by physical examination alone. It is most appropriate for procedures involving large effusions that are lying relatively close to the skin surface, such as Baker's cysts and large joint effusions. It may also be used for a large deeper seated joint such as the hip.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18566028\"><span class=\"h3\">Techniques for the indirect approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The midpoint of the US image on the screen corresponds to the middle point of the transducer probe. The intended needle insertion point should be identified using the probe in the same orientation that is anticipated for the needle and then marked. There are several commonly used options for marking this site, including compression of the skin surface with the point of a retractable ballpoint pen to leave a small dimple; producing a mark with pressure of an extended paper clip; and use of an indelible marker. If a paper clip is used, the metal of an extended paper clip induces lines of bright repetition echoes in the US image. Subsequently, the exact spot for puncturing can be delineated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F67723\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67723 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>The depth of the lesion should be measured to facilitate selection of a needle of sufficient length. The skin should be sterilized using standard techniques, and the needle should be inserted near the mark in the same direction as the probe was oriented. The entire procedure takes only a few minutes for the experienced <span class=\"nowrap\">clinician/ultrasonographer</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint aspiration or injection in adults: Technique and indications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18566035\"><span class=\"h2\">Direct approach</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18566044\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications for the direct approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The direct approach to use of US guidance is indicated for reaching otherwise difficult-to-locate anatomic sites or small collections of fluid or to avoid injury to particular structures, such as vascular structures, nerves, and tendons in a critical environment like the wrist. We prefer to perform injections or punctures of small effusions, small joints, and difficult-to-reach joints under direct guidance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18566051\"><span class=\"h3\">Techniques for the direct approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When injecting under direct sonographic visualization, the needle should appear on the side of the US image where it is localized anatomically. Thus, it should appear in the image on the right side of the transducer probe if it is introduced from the right side of the probe. The clinician performing the procedure should be positioned facing the scanner, allowing a direct view of the screen. Most right-handed sonographers prefer to hold the US probe in their left hand and the needle in their right hand. The opposite positioning may be preferred by left-handed individuals.</p><p>Aseptic technique should be employed. We prefer the use of sterile US transmission gel and cleaning the probe surface with alcohol rather than a sterile sleeve for the transducer probe when the direct approach is used. An alternative approach preferred by some clinicians, or in countries where sterile gel is not readily available, is to envelop the probe in a sterile glove filled with gel.</p><p>When the sterile-gel US approach is used, the skin is wiped with an alcohol swab and the probe surface is also cleaned with alcohol. Although iodinated solution can be used on the skin, the transducer surface may be affected by iodine, and cleaning with a 70 percent alcohol solution or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> solution is used for the transducer probe. The sterile gel is then placed over the skin and the probe. Alternatives to the use of sterile gel are use of a gel-filled sterile transducer sleeve or sterile hand glove placed over the transducer. The needle is then placed under the probe and slowly advanced to the target. The use of sterile gel allows the needle to be inserted through the gel into the skin if it is overlying the preferred injection site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18566058\"><span class=\"h3\">Needle visualization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The needle should be introduced adjacent to the footprint of the probe, and the introduction of the needle is directly visualized in real time. Several strategies are used to optimize needle visualization. The needle appears as a bright line if the probe is oriented in the same axis plane as the needle path. Thus, the tip of the needle is clearly visible on the longitudinal image when the needle is parallel to the US beam. Small movements of the needle can make it more visible so that the progression of the needle course can be followed on the screen. If the long axis of the transducer probe and US beam is transverse to the needle, only a tiny bright spot indicates the needle, which does not necessarily correspond with the needle tip; thus, we generally discourage relying upon transverse scanning alone for these procedures. The needle tip should ideally be identified as a moving deflector and visualized throughout the procedure.</p><p>Another technique for ensuring correct placement is to inject a small amount of air or a mix of <span class=\"nowrap\">air/glucocorticoid/saline</span> into the joint through the needle. Air bubbles are clearly visible as a white line, white dots, or bright spheres. This is especially useful to ensure the needle position in the shoulder region or in difficult-to-enter joints such as the hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. No resistance to injection should be encountered and quick dissipation should follow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18566065\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications and limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no medical contraindications to the use of musculoskeletal US. However, several factors may limit availability or use of this technique in clinical practice (eg, in rheumatology or orthopaedics). These include the time and cost of acquiring sufficient training, expertise, and, where applicable, credentialing to perform and interpret the musculoskeletal US examination in anatomic regions of interest; the cost of equipment; the need to comply with and expense of regulatory or clinical requirements for image documentation; and proper coding and billing. Other factors include any added time that may be required in the office setting and the cost to the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18566072\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACHES TO SPECIFIC JOINTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approaches to the most common procedures that benefit from ultrasound (US) guidance are outlined below. The directly visualized US approach is suggested for most of the regions described. The techniques and indications, medication regimens, and complications of aspiration or injection of joints and related structures are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraarticular-and-soft-tissue-injections-what-agents-to-inject-and-how-frequently\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraarticular and soft tissue injections: What agent(s) to inject and how frequently?&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint aspiration or injection in adults: Complications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint aspiration or injection in adults: Technique and indications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The decision regarding which procedures to perform using US guidance depends upon multiple factors. These include the availability and cost of using US in the clinical, usually outpatient, practice setting; the expertise of the clinician in US and in performing musculoskeletal procedures without US; the specific joint or associated structure of interest; and other clinical factors (eg, lack of success of an initial &ldquo;blind&rdquo; procedure). Trial data to demonstrate which specific procedures provide significant benefit with respect to patient outcomes are limited. (See <a href=\"#H18565970\" class=\"local\">'Accuracy and efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p>US guidance is of greatest use for joints or other periarticular spaces that are especially difficult to enter based upon external landmarks alone. In our experience, these regions and the recommended US approach include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carpal tunnel (direct or indirect)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metacarpophalangeal joints (direct)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hip joint (direct or indirect)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sacroiliac joint (direct)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subtalar joint (direct)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metatarsophalangeal joints (direct)</p><p/><p>US guidance may be of benefit, depending upon multiple factors, including cost, expertise of the clinician in unguided musculoskeletal procedures, and the success of initially unguided procedures, in regions for which procedures guided by external landmarks are common practice.

(See <a href=\"#H18565970\" class=\"local\">'Accuracy and efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The indirect approach of US guidance is used to better define the anatomic location of an area to be injected or aspirated than can be accomplished by physical examination alone. The needle insertion site is marked with the help of such guidance, and the procedure is performed without direct US visualization. It is most appropriate for procedures involving large structures that are lying relatively close to the skin surface. (See <a href=\"#H18566012\" class=\"local\">'Skin surface marking or indirect approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The direct approach to US guidance is indicated for reaching otherwise difficult-to-locate anatomic sites or to avoid injury to particular structures. (See <a href=\"#H18566035\" class=\"local\">'Direct approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When injecting under direct US visualization, the needle should appear on the side of the US image where it is localized anatomically. The clinician doing the procedure should be positioned facing the scanner, allowing a direct view of the screen. (See <a href=\"#H18566051\" class=\"local\">'Techniques for the direct approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The needle appears as a bright line if the probe is oriented in the same axis plane as the needle path. Small movements of the needle can make it more visible. If the US beam is transverse to the needle, only a bright spot indicates the tip of the needle. Small amounts of injected air or <span class=\"nowrap\">air/fluid</span> mixtures can be visualized as a white line, dots, or spheres.
