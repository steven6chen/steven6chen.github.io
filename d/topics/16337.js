Within this category, tumors from many primary sites with varying biology are represented. Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) comprise approximately 5 percent of CUPs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-classification-and-management-of-cancers-of-unknown-primary-site\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the classification and management of cancers of unknown primary site&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Effective treatment is available for some patients with SCC of unknown primary site who fit certain clinical syndromes, particularly those with involvement of the cervical or inguinal lymph nodes. For this reason, appropriate evaluation of these patients is essential prior to embarking on treatment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical lymph nodes are the most common metastatic site for SCCs. Patients with tumor involving upper or mid-level cervical nodes are likely to have a primary cancer of the head and neck. By contrast, a lung primary should be suspected in those with lower cervical lymph nodes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SCCs of unknown primary site involving inguinal lymph nodes usually arise from a primary anogenital malignancy. Some of these patients may be curable with locoregional therapy directed against their primary tumor.</p><p/><p>The diagnosis and management of patients with SCC of unknown primary site other than those presumed to be of head and neck origin is reviewed here. The evaluation and treatment of head and neck squamous carcinoma of unknown primary is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-unknown-primary\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">UPPER OR MIDCERVICAL LYMPH NODES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with involvement of the upper or midcervical nodes are usually middle-aged or older adults, and many have a history of substantial tobacco <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alcohol use. A second group of patients (approximately 25 percent) have human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Patients with HPV-associated cancers are less likely to have a history of alcohol consumption; primary sites (when identified) are in the oropharynx.</p><p>A primary tumor in the head and neck region should be suspected and should be the focus of the initial diagnostic evaluation. The diagnostic evaluation and subsequent treatment of these patients is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-unknown-primary\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus associated head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">LOWER CERVICAL OR SUPRACLAVICULAR NODES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A primary lung cancer should be suspected when lower cervical or supraclavicular nodes are involved, although a head and neck primary is possible. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is indicated if the chest radiograph and head and neck examination are unrevealing.</p><p>If the fiberoptic bronchoscopy reveals a primary bronchogenic cancer, patient management is the same as that for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-treatment-and-prognosis-of-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the initial evaluation, treatment and prognosis of lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the absence of a detectable primary site, the results are poor. Nevertheless, patients with no detectable disease below the clavicle should be treated with the same approach as patients with upper cervical nodes, since occasional patients will have long-term disease-free survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">INGUINAL LYMPH NODE DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of patients with SCC involving inguinal lymph nodes have a detectable primary site in the genital or anorectal area (including the surrounding skin).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women, careful examination of the vulva, vagina, and cervix is important, with biopsy of any suspicious areas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men should undergo a careful inspection of the penis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In both sexes, digital rectal examination and anoscopy should be performed to exclude anorectal lesions.</p><p/><p>Identification of a primary site in these patients is important since therapy is potentially curative for patients with carcinomas arising in the anogenital region, even after spread to regional lymph nodes. For the occasional patient in whom no primary site is identified, lymphadenectomy with or without postoperative radiation therapy to the inguinal nodal basin sometimes results in long-term survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Although experience is limited in this uncommon group of patients, success with combined chemotherapy and radiation in other cancers originating in this region (ie, cervix, anus, bladder) suggests a potential role for this approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER METASTATIC SITES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metastatic SCC in areas other than the cervical or inguinal lymph nodes usually represents metastasis from a primary lung cancer, but primaries of the skin and uterine cervix are also possible. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and fiberoptic bronchoscopy should be considered if other clinical features suggest the possibility of lung cancer. If a lung cancer is predicted by a molecular cancer classifier assay, additional molecular markers for lung cancer (eg, programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1]) should be evaluated and used to guide therapy. Additionally, analysis for EGFR, ALK, and <em>ROS1</em> is indicated for all patients whose tumor contains any element of adenocarcinoma, even if the histology is mixed. Chemotherapy with regimens employed in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer may be considered in patients with good performance status and no actionable molecular alterations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-therapy-for-the-initial-management-of-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-without-a-driver-mutation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic therapy for the initial management of advanced non-small cell lung cancer without a driver mutation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with the diagnosis of poorly differentiated SCC should be evaluated carefully, particularly if other clinical features are unusual for lung cancer (eg, young patient, nonsmoker, unusual metastatic sites). This histologic diagnosis is sometimes based upon scant histologic criteria and may include patients with poorly differentiated carcinoma, in whom other diagnoses should be considered. For this reason, additional pathologic evaluation with immunohistochemical stains, gene expression profiling (molecular cancer classifier assay), or electron microscopy should be considered in such patients. If the diagnosis is still unclear, a trial of empiric chemotherapy for poorly differentiated carcinoma should be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606939224\"><span class=\"h1\">NUT MIDLINE CARCINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NUT midline carcinomas are aggressive, poorly differentiated tumors that include variable degrees of squamous differentiation in approximately one-half of cases. These tumors are defined by the presence of a chromosomal rearrangement of the <em>NUT</em> gene and have a distinct clinical presentation and clinical course category [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poorly-differentiated-cancer-from-an-unknown-primary-site#H1568146612\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Poorly differentiated cancer from an unknown primary site&quot;, section on 'NUT midline carcinoma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with an occult squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), the initial diagnostic evaluation should attempt to identify the primary site, which can serve as the basis for optimizing treatment. The initial diagnostic evaluation is based upon the site of disease involvement:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients presenting with SCC involving the mid or upper cervical lymph nodes and without an obvious primary, diagnostic evaluation should focus primarily on identifying an occult head and neck primary. If no primary can be identified, such patients should be treated for locally advanced cancer of the head and neck rather than with empiric chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-unknown-primary\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with SCC involving lower cervical or supraclavicular lymph nodes, the initial evaluation should include a search for an occult lung primary as well as an occult head and neck lesion. For patients with no identifiable primary tumor, we suggest treatment for an occult head and neck tumor rather than with empiric chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Lower cervical or supraclavicular nodes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with SCC involving inguinal lymph nodes, an intensive search should be made for an anogenital primary tumor, which can be identified in most cases. For the occasional patient in whom no primary site can be identified, we suggest lymphadenectomy with or without postoperative radiation therapy to the inguinal nodal basin rather than with empiric chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Inguinal lymph node disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SCC arising in other sites is rare. Most of these patients have an occult lung primary site, although occasional patients have primary sites in the skin or uterine cervix. If a lung cancer is predicted by a molecular cancer classifier assay, additional molecular markers for lung cancer (eg, programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1]) should be evaluated and used to guide therapy. Additionally, analysis for EGFR, ALK, and <em>ROS1</em> is indicated for all patients whose tumor contains any element of adenocarcinoma, even if the histology is mixed. We suggest an empiric chemotherapy regimen effective for non-small cell lung cancer for patients without actionable molecular alterations. (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
