The exact mechanisms by which hypoxemia and acidosis provoke arrhythmias are unclear. One possible explanation comes from the observation that norepinephrine levels (compared with normal values) were elevated in hypercapnic, hypoxemic patients with COPD who were hospitalized with fluid retention and peripheral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It is hypothesized that the low arterial blood pressure caused by hypercapnia contributed to the elevation in norepinephrine.

Theophylline is also associated with rhythm disturbances, such as sinus tachycardia, premature atrial beats, supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, unifocal and multifocal atrial tachycardia, and ventricular arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of methylxanthines in the treatment of COPD&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The frequency of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias increases with the serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> level, as illustrated in these studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cross-sectional, retrospective study of 100 patients, the heart rate was directly related to the serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> concentration, and the serum theophylline concentration was the strongest independent predictor of arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patients with a serum concentration of theophylline (10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> [56 to 111 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> had an odds ratio for arrhythmia of 3.7, when compared with those patients who had serum theophylline levels of less than 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>. Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) was found in 8 percent of patients with a serum theophylline concentration of 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> compared with 16 percent of those with values greater than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study prospectively evaluated arrhythmias among 16 patients with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> toxicity (a serum theophylline concentration exceeding 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Sinus tachycardia and ventricular premature beats (VPBs) were the most common arrhythmias, occurring in 85 percent and 80 percent of subjects, respectively. The frequency and complexity of ventricular ectopy were largely influenced by the theophylline concentration and by coexistent conditions, such as underlying ischemic heart disease and age. Potentially life-threatening arrhythmias were rare (one patient had ventricular tachycardia), and only one patient required intervention with antiarrhythmic therapy.</p><p/><p>However, the magnitude of the effect of low therapeutic doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> on the occurrence of arrhythmias is unclear, and the current target serum level is lower (8 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> [44 to 67 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> than the range used in earlier studies (10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> [56 to 111 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Beta-adrenergic agonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhaled beta-2 adrenergic agonists are a mainstay of therapy for COPD, but have the potential to increase heart rate and may increase cardiac arrhythmias via nonselective beta adrenergic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, a number of studies support the overall safety of inhaled selective beta-2 adrenergic agonists. </p><p>The effect of nebulized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> on sinus and atrioventricular (AV) node activity was examined in a study of 18 patients with asthma or mild COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Nebulized albuterol (5 mg) shortened the sinus cycle length and sinus node recovery time. In addition, administration of albuterol enhanced the AV nodal conduction, reduced AV nodal refractory time, and decreased myocardial refractory time. </p><p>Despite the effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> on sinus and AV nodal conduction noted above, clinical studies suggest that inhaled selective beta-adrenergic agonists infrequently cause serious arrhythmias. A meta-analysis of 33 randomized trials of patients receiving beta-agonists for obstructive airways disease revealed that beta-adrenergic agonists were associated with an increased risk of sinus tachycardia (RR 3.06, 95% CI 1.7-5.5), but were not associated with a significantly increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (composite endpoint of ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, syncope, heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and sudden death) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A single inhaled dose of beta-agonist increased the heart rate (mean 9 beats per minute, 95% CI 5.32-12.92). The effect of high-dose albuterol for COPD exacerbations was not addressed in this study.</p><p>The effect of long-acting beta agonists (LABA) on heart rate and development of arrhythmia has also been examined. An analysis of the data from two trials examining the effect of LABAs on heart rate and cardiac arrhythmias found a slight increase in atrial tachycardias, but no increase in mean heart rate or risk of serious arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. A third trial of 1429 patients with COPD found that administration of a LABA (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=arformoterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arformoterol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salmeterol</a>) did not result in a statistically significant increase of atrial arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The role of LABAs in the management of COPD is discussed separately.

It is hypothesized that active cigarette smoking may increase the risk of arrhythmias, due to profibrotic effects of nicotine on myocardial tissue or an increased susceptibility to catecholamines, but this has not been definitively demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Some patients with COPD lack the normal pattern of cardiac circadian rhythm changes and some have a prolonged QT interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. An absence of the normal nocturnal decrease in sympathetic tone among patients with COPD is suggested by 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings that do not reveal the typical nocturnal slowing of the heart rate. It has been suggested that this altered circadian pattern may predispose to arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, causes, and pathophysiology&quot;</a>.) </p><p>QT dispersion (maximum QT interval minus minimum QT interval measured on an ECG) is an approximate measure of abnormal ventricular repolarization. An association has been noted between the presence of ventricular arrhythmias and increased QT dispersion in COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The mechanism of increased QT dispersion in COPD and contribution of this effect to ventricular arrhythmias in COPD are not known. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;QT dispersion: Measurement and interpretation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=qt-dispersion-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;QT dispersion: Clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>P wave dispersion, the difference between the maximum (Pmax) and minimum (Pmin) duration of P waves on a surface ECG, is a measure of variability in intraatrial and interatrial conduction times. Initial studies suggest that increased P wave dispersion may be a predictor for development of atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Among patients with COPD, P wave dispersion is increased (greater variability in conduction times) compared with healthy controls, but it is not known whether this reflects co-morbid cardiac disease or a particular effect related to COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The accuracy of P wave indices for predicting atrial arrhythmias needs further study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventricular diastolic dysfunction and respiratory failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of arrhythmias in COPD has been associated with concurrent left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. In a series of 22 patients with COPD, diastolic dysfunction was the only clinical variable predictive of ventricular premature beats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Among patients with COPD, ventricular diastolic dysfunction may be related to right ventricular overload from pulmonary hypertension or to common causes such as increased age or comorbid myocardial ischemia or systemic hypertension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Respiratory failure may also contribute to the risk of arrhythmias. In the preceding study of diastolic dysfunction in COPD, atrial premature beats correlated with hypoxemia and hypercarbia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Furthermore, the number of arrhythmias significantly decreased when the respiratory failure improved. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H874419\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise does not appear to increase the risk of serious arrhythmias in patients with severe COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In a case series of 122 patients with severe COPD, for example, ventricular arrhythmias (eg, VPBs <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;6/min,</span> bigeminy, multiform VPBs, couplets, or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia [VT]) developed during exercise in 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. None of these required specific treatment. Half of the patients who had ventricular arrhythmias during exercise had similar or lower grade ventricular arrhythmias at rest prior to testing. Patients without a history of ischemic heart disease or without any evidence of a cardiac arrhythmia at rest have a low likelihood of developing serious arrhythmias during exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H883203\"><span class=\"h1\">OCCURRENCE OF ARRHYTHMIAS IN PATIENTS WITH COPD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence and prevalence of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias among patients with COPD varies widely among reported studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/3,12,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12,25,26</a>]. This variation may be due to differences in the study populations (eg, severity of COPD, presence of respiratory failure), the presence or absence of ventricular failure or underlying cardiac disease, the methodology used to record the arrhythmias (a single electrocardiogram [ECG] versus a continuous 24-hour recording), and the medications used in management of COPD (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a>, beta-adrenergic agonists). &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H883462\"><span class=\"h2\">Holter monitoring in stable COPD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac arrhythmias, both supraventricular and ventricular, are significantly more common among patients with COPD compared to those without, with a prevalence that varies according to the severity of underlying COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/3,12,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12,27</a>].

MAT and other serious atrial arrhythmias can be associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in patients with acute respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. </p><p>In a study of 590 patients hospitalized with an acute exacerbation of COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmia were independent predictors of death at one year (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.10-3.31) and (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.14-4.51), respectively. Furthermore, among patients admitted to the hospital with respiratory failure due to COPD, ventricular arrhythmias were associated with a mortality rate of 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmias-in-copd/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3959820996\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The risk is further elevated during periods of acute exacerbation and thoracic surgery; however, even patients with stable COPD have a fairly high rate of rhythm disturbances. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H883203\" class=\"local\">'Occurrence of arrhythmias in patients with COPD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple factors contribute to the development of arrhythmias in patients with COPD, including hypoxemia, respiratory acidosis, electrolyte disturbances, medications, systemic hypertension, cardiac autonomic dysfunction, coronary heart disease, and heart failure. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Potential contributing factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Characteristic features of multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) include discrete P waves with at least <strong>three</strong> different morphologies, an atrial rate faster than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min,</span> isoelectric intervals separating the P waves, and variability in the P-P intervals, P-R duration, and R-R intervals. MAT most commonly develops in the setting of an acute exacerbation of COPD, but is also associated with certain drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a>), other pulmonary processes (eg, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, hypoxemia), and metabolic disorders. (See <a href=\"#H883521\" class=\"local\">'Multifocal atrial tachycardia'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multifocal-atrial-tachycardia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multifocal atrial tachycardia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial fibrillation is characterized by an irregularly irregular rhythm and the absence of distinct P waves. New onset of atrial fibrillation is associated with advancing COPD and is in the differential diagnosis of worsening dyspnea and hypoxemia among patients with COPD. (See <a href=\"#H883569\" class=\"local\">'Atrial fibrillation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular tachyarrhythmias, ranging from isolated premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) to nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, are common in ambulatory and hospitalized patients with COPD. It appears unlikely that asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias adversely impact mortality among ambulatory patients with COPD. (See <a href=\"#H883562\" class=\"local\">'Ventricular arrhythmias'</a> above and <a href=\"#H231974\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1920017\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of arrhythmias in patients with COPD begins with correction of hypoxemia, respiratory acidosis, electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), and cardiac ischemia. Medications that can prolong the QT interval are removed and arrhythmogenic drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> are decreased in dose or discontinued. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short-acting selective beta-2 adrenergic agents are key components of therapy for exacerbations of COPD. For patients with tachyarrhythmias, the dose should be titrated to provide adequate bronchodilation and relief of dyspnea without excess cardiac chronotropic effects. (See <a href=\"#H1291532\" class=\"local\">'General measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with MAT in the setting of an exacerbation of COPD, the main treatment is directed toward reversing bronchoconstriction and improving gas exchange. Pharmacologic therapy for MAT is indicated when a rapid ventricular response produces or worsens ischemia, heart failure, peripheral perfusion, or oxygenation. For most patients with symptomatic MAT in the setting of COPD, we suggest using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>); metoprolol is reserved for patients without active bronchoconstriction in whom adequate rate control is not achieved with verapamil.

Pharmacologic therapy is used to control the ventricular response if cardioversion is unsuccessful or not performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F83353\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83353 \">table 3</a>).
