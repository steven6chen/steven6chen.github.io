Disruptions in the function <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> integrity of the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are a particularly important problem in patients receiving chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiotherapy. Mucositis, which reflects a short-term, self-limited adverse effect of treatment, can affect the entire alimentary tract. The range of symptoms includes oral ulcerations, dysphagia and odynophagia, gastritis, diarrhea, and malabsorption.

Among the other potential oral consequences of chemotherapy are infection of oral soft tissues, gingival bleeding, and alterations in taste; all of these complications can cause pain and impair nutrition.</p><p>Chemotherapy-associated acute oral toxicity will be reviewed here. Oral mucositis in the setting of high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is discussed in detail elsewhere, as are radiation-induced oral mucositis, osteonecrosis of the jaw related to use of antiresorptive therapy and angiogenesis inhibitors in patients with advanced cancer, and late oral toxicities in cancer survivors.

This stage may be followed by the development of solitary elevated white desquamative patches that are slightly painful.

Severe pseudomembranous or erosive mucositis can lead to secondary infection or sepsis (particularly in the presence of concomitant neutropenia), and necessitate the use of parenteral nutrition <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> opiates. In addition, oral or gingival bleeding can occur if the patient becomes thrombocytopenic.

It assigns a numeric grade to eight different aspects of the oral assessment (possible range of scores, 8 to 24).

While the use of palifermin to prevent oral mucositis in patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy in the setting of autologous HCT using preparative regimens with a high risk of significant mucositis is reasonable, given the expense of this agent, the lack of benefit in preventing irritation of the rest of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and the lack of efficacy in other settings, such as allogeneic HCT and induction therapy for acute leukemia, many centers do not use it except in patients undergoing autologous HCT with a preparative regimen containing total body radiation. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Palifermin'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipient-in-the-immediate-post-transplant-period#H598154\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the hematopoietic cell transplant recipient in the immediate post-transplant period&quot;, section on 'Mucositis and nutritional support'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palifermin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">palifermin</a> could be considered an alternative to dose reduction for subsequent chemotherapy cycles in patients who developed severe (grade 3 or worse) mucositis during treatment with an FU- or doxorubicin-based chemotherapy regimen, it is expensive, and there are no data demonstrating that outcomes are better as compared with dose modification. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Glutamine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of low-level laser therapy to prevent oral mucositis in patients undergoing HCT conditioned with high-dose chemotherapy with or without total body irradiation may be helpful. Because this therapy requires expensive equipment and specialized operator training, it is limited to centers capable of supporting the necessary technology and training. The relative benefits of laser therapy versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palifermin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">palifermin</a> in patients undergoing high-dose therapy and HCT have not been addressed in any trial. Given these limitations and the uncertainty as to optimal wavelength for beneficial effects, laser therapy is rarely used in clinical practice. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Laser therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of high reactivation rates, herpes simplex virus (HSV)-seropositive patients who are undergoing either induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia or receiving high-dose &quot;conditioning&quot; regimens followed by HCT should receive antiviral prophylaxis.

In addition, pain may limit the ability to take in adequate fluids and nutrition.

Rinsing with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-saliva-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial saliva</a> may lessen the duration and severity of mucositis. A soft toothbrush or foam swab (Toothette) cleans teeth effectively but may be too harsh for patients with moderate to severe stomatitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diet should be limited to foods that do not require significant chewing; acidic, salty, or dry foods should be avoided. If the patient is unable to swallow foods or liquids, parenteral fluid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nutritional support may be needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of mucosal coating agents are available, including topical <span class=\"nowrap\">kaolin/pectin,</span> Orabase, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>, oral antacids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maltodextrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">maltodextrin</a> (Gelclair), and compounded mixtures, such as &quot;miracle mouthwash&quot; that contain coating agents, often in combination with topical anesthetics. There are no randomized trials comparing any of these treatments, and no single approach can be recommended over the others. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Mucosal coating agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate analgesia can sometimes be provided topically (using viscous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, First mouthwash, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a> candies), but many patients require systemic narcotics. (See <a href=\"#H475882560\" class=\"local\">'Analgesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no evidence that prophylactic administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nystatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nystatin</a> suspension or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> reduces the frequency of superinfection with Candida albicans, and we recommend against this practice (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We recommend topical, (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=clotrimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clotrimazole</a> troches or nystatin suspension) rather than systemic, antifungal therapy for patients who develop superficial oropharyngeal candidiasis as a complication of oral mucositis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Oral candidiasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The possibility of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection should be considered in a patient who has intraoral vesicles or unusually painful oral ulcerative lesions.

We recommend that antiviral prophylaxis be limited to patients who are seropositive for HSV and who are undergoing high-dose chemotherapy for a hematologic malignancy or HCT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).
