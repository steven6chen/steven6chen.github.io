Three forms of cystinosis have been described: the infantile (nephropathic) form (<a href=\"http://www.omim.org/entry/219800&amp;token=G+kOOgscg7PQzd0gXq5S92dgGfh0T0f/PBVNlJnKl6drR8cti8GAVd5udRIloZPW&amp;TOPIC_ID=6139\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MIM #219800</a>), the late-onset (juvenile) form (<a href=\"http://www.omim.org/entry/219900&amp;token=G+kOOgscg7PQzd0gXq5S92dgGfh0T0f/PBVNlJnKl6dFKABCcRjY+dWXLQ9MmqfB&amp;TOPIC_ID=6139\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MIM #219900</a>); and the adult (benign) form (<a href=\"http://www.omim.org/entry/219750&amp;token=G+kOOgscg7PQzd0gXq5S92EhjsTXEjZMJ/hQoPvgjEI07bMAt3A0hfKceChH5gIG&amp;TOPIC_ID=6139\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MIM #219750</a>).The diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of cystinosis and the clinical features of the three different forms of cystinosis will be discussed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H582802639\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infantile cystinosis, also referred to as nephropathic cystinosis, is the most common form of cystinosis and is estimated to affect 1 of every 100,000 to 200,000 children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. There appears to be a higher incidence in some regions, such as Brittany in France or Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Quebec in Canada, due to founding cystinosis mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cystine is derived from protein degradation within the lysosomes of cells. Free cystine is normally transported through the lysosomal membrane to the cytosol where it is reutilized after its transformation to cysteine. In cystinosis, cystine accumulates inside the lysosomes because of a defect in the gene that encodes cystinosin, the protein that transports cystine across the lysosomal membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-13</a>].

Multiple observations indicate that the same gene is involved in all forms of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Both the infantile and juvenile forms can occur in a given family. In addition, complementation studies using fibroblasts from patients' different types of cystinosis have shown the absence of correction of the metabolic defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. It therefore appears that there is no genetic heterogeneity and that the differences in the clinical manifestations result from mutations occurring in a single gene (allelic mutation).</p><p>The gene for cystinosis has been mapped to chromosome 17p13 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

It appears to be a novel hydrogen ion driven transporter that is responsible for exporting cystine from lysosomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>More than 100 mutations in the first 10 exons and in the promotor of the gene have been described in patients with cystinosis, with the clinical phenotype segregating with specific defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/8,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,33-35</a>]:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Infantile form</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large deletions, as well as other mutations that would result in missense or in-frame deletions, are associated with infantile cystinosis, the most severe phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. These abnormalities result in the loss of adequate protein function, including no protein expression with some mutations.</p><p>A 65 kb deletion is the most frequent mutation found in the homozygous state, being observed in nearly one-third of patients with cystinosis. This deletion is present in either the homozygous or the heterozygous state in approximately 75 percent of patients of European origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], thus allowing a rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic test for this disease (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below).

Similar to intermediate cystinosis, this form may be due to the inheritance of different abnormal alleles, including the presence of a severe plus a mild mutation, the latter of which does not adversely affect kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">INFANTILE CYSTINOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although cystinosis is characterized by both renal and extrarenal symptoms, children appear normal at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first clinical signs of infantile cystinosis appear between three and six months of age; they are largely due to impaired proximal tubular reabsorptive capacity, leading to the varied manifestations of de Toni-Debr&eacute;-Fanconi syndrome (tubular proteinuria with massive excretion of beta-2 microglobulin and lysozyme, glycosuria, phosphaturia, and aminoaciduria).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sodium wasting and severe urinary concentrating defect result in polyuria (reaching 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day),</span> polydipsia, poor weight gain, growth retardation, vomiting, constipation, weakness, unexplained fever, and acute dehydration episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive losses of potassium, sodium, and bicarbonate lead to hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and metabolic acidosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin D-resistant rickets (manifested by swelling of the wrists, frontal bossing, and genu valgum) is often noted at presentation due in part to phosphate wasting and hypophosphatemia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-rickets-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of rickets in children&quot;</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypouricemia is constant and hypercalciuria may lead to nephrocalcinosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Visual impairment may occur later, in children older than 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].

It can be detected by the demonstration of high plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, which occur before the thyroxine concentration begins to fall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

The mean age of puberty in affected females is 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>], and successful pregnancies have been reported in women with cystinosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic &minus; Children with cystinosis have normal cognitive function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>] but some patients may have mild neurocognitive abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. A subtle visuoperceptual defect and lower cognitive performances with impairment of visual memory and tactile recognition have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>], as well as social difficulties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. These findings may present as early as three to seven years of age, favoring the hypothesis of a direct role of the gene defect rather than cystine accumulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. In addition, there is a report of an increased risk for Chiari I malformations in children with cystinosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Two of the 10 patients had neurologic symptoms (headaches, dizziness, speech difficulty, sensorineural hearing loss) that might be due to this finding. The authors speculate early deformation or abnormality of bone growth (eg, rickets) is the underlying pathogenetic mechanism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone &ndash; Excessive bone fractures have been reported in children with cystinosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/69-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-71</a>]. Although the pathogenesis is unknown, defective bone remodeling, resulting in diminished bone mass and the presence of microfractures, has been proposed as the underlying mechanism for the increased risk of bone fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].More severe central nervous system involvement is a late complication that occurs after age 20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/73-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-75</a>]. The main symptoms are difficulty in walking and swallowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/55,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,57</a>], progressive loss of speech, memory loss, diminished intellectual function, and dementia. Pyramidal signs, cranial nerve defects, dysphagia, and dysarthria also may be seen. Stroke-like episodes with ischemic lesions have been reported. Benign intracranial hypertension may present with headaches and papilledema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystinosis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].

The dose should be progressively increased from 10 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day (maximum dose of 1.95 <span class=\"nowrap\">gm/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day), given in divided doses every six hours. Levels of cystine are measured in white blood cells once the maintenance dose is reached, then monthly for three months, quarterly for one year, and then twice a year.

The proposed mechanism is that copper deficiency results in decreased activity of lysyl oxidase, an enzyme required for the production of collagen cross-linking aldehydes needed to form the cysteine-cysteamine complex, which is able to exit the lysosome.

Patients present between three and six months of age with signs and symptoms due to renal tubular dysfunction. These include polyuria, polydipsia, poor weight gain, vomiting, weakness, unexplained fever, and acute episodes of hypovolemia. These children have a progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), resulting in ESRD by 10 years of age. Nonrenal findings include ocular abnormalities, hepatomegaly, hypothyroidism, muscle weakness, and growth retardation. Although cognitive function is normal in children, complications of the central nervous system occur after 20 years of age. In affected males, delayed puberty is common.
