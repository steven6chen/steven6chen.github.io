This causes your eyes to feel dry and irritated. The medical term for dry eye is &quot;keratoconjunctivitis sicca.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3539143213\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes dry eye?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people have dry eye, including about one-third of older adults. A few people with dry eye might have another disease, such as Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, diabetes, or Parkinson disease. Some medicines can cause dry eye symptoms or make them worse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9361624\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of dry eye?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People have different symptoms but the most common ones are eyes that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel dry or burn</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Look red</p><p/><p>Other symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being bothered by light</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling like something is in your eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blurry vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Watery eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discomfort wearing contact lenses</p><p/><p>In some people the symptoms are worse when it is cold or windy or if they are in a dry environment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9361639\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your eye stays red, irritated, or painful for several days, you should see your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9361654\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. The doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have dry eye by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9361669\"><span class=\"h1\">How is dry eye treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Artificial tears</a>&quot; are the main treatment for dry eye. They can keep the eye moist and help with the symptoms of dry eye. You can buy artificial tears at the drug store or grocery store without a prescription. They come in liquid, gel, or ointments. Your doctor or nurse will help you decide which form is best for you. It is usually best to avoid eye drops that are meant to reduce redness.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Artificial tears</a> help with the symptoms of dry eye, but they do not cure the condition. They work only as long as you keep using them.</p><p>Other things you can do to help improve your symptoms are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try to blink a lot, especially when you are reading or using the computer. This helps keep your eye moist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid excess air conditioning or heating as much as you can. Also avoid sitting directly in the flow of the cold or hot air.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a humidifier in your bedroom and any other space where you spend a lot of time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid smoke and smoky air</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear protective eyewear when you are outside. Glasses that cover more of your face, or have special shields on the sides, can protect your eyes from wind and dry air.</p><p/><p>If your dry eye does not get better in 3 to 4 weeks, your doctor or nurse might send you to see an eye doctor (called an &quot;ophthalmologist&quot;). The eye doctor can do more tests and might suggest other treatments. These include prescription eye drops or ointments, special glasses or goggles, oral medicines (pills), or surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10259671\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sjogrens-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
