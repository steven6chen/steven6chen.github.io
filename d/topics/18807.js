The prospective multicenter Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score (ADD-RS) Plus D-Dimer in Suspected Acute Aortic Dissection (ADvISED) study used a combination of the ADD-RS and D-dimer as a diagnostic tool in over 1800 such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-cardiovascular-medicine/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The combination of ADD-RS &le;1<strong> </strong>plus a negative D-dimer effectively ruled out AAS, missing only one case in about 300 patients, and would enable about 60 percent of patients with a low probability for AAS to be spared from unnecessary conclusive vascular imaging. Although this initial experience appears promising, additional validation in a broader patient population is needed before routine use of this combination as a diagnostic tool can be recommended.

In a well-performed, post-hoc subgroup analysis of the ARISTOTLE trial (which compared anticoagulant therapies in approximately 18,000 patients with AF), digoxin use was significantly associated with an increased risk of death at levels &ge;1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-cardiovascular-medicine/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

In a series of 1509 patients with older generation pacemakers or ICDs (eg, those that don&rsquo;t specifically meet MRI-conditional criteria specified by the Food and Drug Administration, or &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; devices) who underwent thoracic or non-thoracic MRI examinations and were followed for one year, there were no clinically significant events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-cardiovascular-medicine/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. While this and earlier reports are reassuring, the presence of a non-MRI-conditional pacemaker or ICD requires precautionary measures including device programming before and after MRI and patient monitoring during the imaging procedure, with availability of a defibrillator and code cart. If the examination is indicated and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness, MR imaging in patients with non-MRI-conditional permanent pacemakers or ICDs can be undertaken provided specific precautionary measures are in place.

In a single-center case series of five patients with structural heart disease with failed prior radiofrequency ablation (or who were not a candidate for ablation) and ongoing VT in spite of two or more antiarrhythmic drugs, stereotactic radiation therapy reduced the VT burden in excess of 99 percent and was generally well tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-cardiovascular-medicine/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Given the magnitude of reduction in ventricular arrhythmias in a patient population with otherwise limited treatment options, stereotactic radiation therapy is a potentially attractive therapy but requires additional efficacy and safety evaluation in larger studies.

In a 2017 systematic review that included only studies of asymptomatic patients with Brugada ECG findings who had undergone invasive EP testing (six studies with 1138 patients), roughly one-third of patients were found to have inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT) during EP testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-cardiovascular-medicine/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although patients with inducible VT were more than twice as likely to experience an arrhythmic event (sustained VT, sudden cardiac death, or appropriate defibrillator therapy), the event rate was low in both groups (3.3 versus 1.6 percent), and the difference was not statistically significant. As such, we do not recommend EP testing in most asymptomatic patients with Brugada pattern ECG findings. Additionally, the overall low event rate is reassuring and suggests a low risk of future arrhythmic events in these patients.

Until now, best estimates have suggested an incidence of approximately 1 in 50,000 athlete-years. In a new study using 2009 to 2014 data from a Canadian database recording all out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrests (SCA) in Ontario, Canada, the overall rate of SCA in athletes was 0.76 per 100,000 athlete-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-cardiovascular-medicine/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. With 44 percent of patients surviving to hospital discharge following SCA, the overall rate of SCD was 0.42 per 100,000 athlete-years. These data suggest the incidence of SCD in athletes is one-fourth of previous estimates and raise a question about the role of preparticipation screening.

The primary composite end point of all-cause death, stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI) occurred with similar frequency in both groups, although the secondary end point of the rate of MI occurred more often with shorter therapy.

While their use is associated with a lower rate of ischemic events, bleeding complications are more common. In an attempt to lower the risk of bleeding, the TROPICAL-ACS trial attempted to identify a group of patients who could be switched to clopidogrel, based on the results of platelet function testing (PFT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-cardiovascular-medicine/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The study found no significant difference in the rate of the primary end point of net clinical benefit (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or bleeding), with a lower rate of bleeding with clopidogrel and a similar rate of ischemic events. However, the small study size led to too few ischemic events to allow for confidence in the findings. We do not recommend using PFT to determine which patients might be switched from prasugrel or ticagrelor to clopidogrel. The decision to switch should be made on a case-by-case basis.

The strongest evidence supporting the use of CA in many of these patients comes from the CASTLE-AF randomized trial that compared CA with medical therapy (rate or rhythm control) in 363 patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF; New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV HF; a left ventricular ejection fraction of &le;35 percent; failure or unwillingness to take antiarrhythmic drug therapy; and an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-cardiovascular-medicine/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. CA significantly reduced the primary composite end point of death from any cause or hospitalization for worsening HF. Based on the results of CASTLE-AF, we now suggest CA as an appropriate treatment for selected patients with AF and HF for whom initial attempts at antiarrhythmic therapy were ineffective.

For PAD, markers associated with inflammation and tobacco smoking predominated, while total cholesterol and body mass were less important. The highest ranked adjusted hazard ratios in PAD were age, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, systolic blood pressure, expired carbon monoxide, cotinine, socioeconomic status, and lipoprotein(a). Diabetes mellitus was also an important risk factor but not the most common cause of PAD. The differences in risk factors for CHD versus PAD may indicate subtle differences in pathophysiology but do not warrant a change in clinical care.

However, the results of three recent randomized trials, RESPECT extended follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-cardiovascular-medicine/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], REDUCE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-cardiovascular-medicine/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], and CLOSE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-cardiovascular-medicine/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], provide stronger evidence that device closure of a PFO plus antiplatelet therapy is more effective than antiplatelet therapy alone for preventing recurrent ischemic stroke in such patients, with absolute risk reductions ranging from 2.2 to 6 percent.
