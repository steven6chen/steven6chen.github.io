Mycophenolate is also widely used as a glucocorticoid-sparing agent for the treatment of patients with a variety of rheumatic diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), inflammatory myopathies, and some systemic vasculitides.</p><p>General principles regarding the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> for the treatment of rheumatic diseases and the side effects associated with its use are discussed in this topic review.

MMF is a prodrug that was developed to improve the bioavailability of MPA. EC-MPS has the potential to reduce the incidence of adverse gastrointestinal (GI) effects, principally diarrhea, by delaying release of MPA into the small intestine instead of the stomach. Both formulations are rapidly hydrolyzed to the active metabolite MPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycophenolate-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The bioavailability of both formulations is approximately 90 percent but is significantly reduced when taken with a high-fat meal. Accordingly, both formulations should be taken on an empty stomach to increase absorption. Alternatively, to improve GI tolerability, the MMF formulation may instead be taken with meals at consistent times each day.</p><p>A dose of 720 mg EC-MPS is therapeutically equivalent to 1000 mg of MMF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycophenolate-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. However, the two formulations should not be interchanged indiscriminately because the rate and extent of absorption of these two products is not equivalent. In some patients, it is necessary to convert from MMF (CellCept) to EC-MPS (Myfortic) to improve GI tolerability. When this occurs, added monitoring of clinical effect is warranted.</p><p>Additional information on the efficacy and safety of the different formulations can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults#H310834638\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation in adults&quot;, section on 'Mycophenolate mofetil versus mycophenolate sodium'</a>.)</p><p>Only free MPA is believed to be pharmacologically active [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycophenolate-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In general, 97 percent of MPA is bound to albumin. This percentage is also decreased in the setting of hyperbilirubinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycophenolate-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Levels of free MPA, therefore, may be increased in patients with hepatic dysfunction or hypoalbuminemia.</p><p>More than 90 percent of active MPA is metabolized by glucuronidation to 7-O-glucuronide (MPAG), an inactive metabolite that is excreted in the urine and feces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycophenolate-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The mean serum half-life of MPA when given as MMF is approximately 18 hours; MPA half-life when delivered as EC-MPS is approximately 12 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycophenolate-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>It is uncertain whether MMF dose adjustments are necessary in patients with liver dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycophenolate-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Measurement of free and total MPA in the serum as a guide to dose adjustment has been advocated by some investigators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycophenolate-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>] but is not a common practice.</p><p>Dose adjustments are necessary in the setting of severe chronic renal failure. Renal failure prolongs the half-life of the inactive metabolite MPAG but not of MPA itself, and accumulation of MPAG may account for increased GI upset when MMF is used in patients on peritoneal- or hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycophenolate-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Initial dose, dose titration, and dose adjustment in organ dysfunction is reviewed elsewhere.

The conversion of inosine monophosphate (IMP) to guanosine monophosphate is catalyzed by IMP dehydrogenase. MPA reversibly inhibits IMP dehydrogenase, leading to decreased B- and T-cell proliferation and decreased antibody production. MPA may lead to immunosuppression through other mechanisms as well, including the induction of apoptosis of activated T lymphocytes and the inhibition of adhesion molecule expression and lymphocyte recruitment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycophenolate-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Two properties of MPA explain the relatively specific inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation. First, IMP dehydrogenase catalyzes the rate-limiting step in purine nucleotide synthesis in lymphocytes but not in other cell types. Second, MPA preferentially binds the type II isoform of IMP dehydrogenase, which is expressed by activated lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycophenolate-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H537477185\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3358444890\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mycophenolate</a> increases the risk of first-trimester pregnancy loss and congenital malformations, including cleft lip and palate, as well as anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, and kidneys.

Daily doses as low as 125 mg may cause intolerable symptoms. In some patients, complaints improve with increasing the number of divided daily doses (while maintaining the same total daily dose). Other patients may require reductions in the total dose.

Abnormal findings were observed in 69 percent of 32 patients with GI symptoms on MMF (500 to 1000 mg twice daily), including changes suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease (28 percent), graft-versus-host disease (19 percent), ischemia (3 percent), or self-limited colitis (16 percent). By comparison, only one of eight patients not on MMF had significant changes, a mild graft-versus-host disease-like pattern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone marrow suppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytopenias are major potential concerns and require regular monitoring. Complete blood counts (CBCs) should be performed after the first one to two weeks of therapy and then once every six to eight weeks thereafter if no cytopenia is noted. (See <a href=\"#H1803579799\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no large studies examining the incidence of infections in patients with rheumatic illness treated with MMF. The existing studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycophenolate-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] are too small to permit generalizations. There are, however, large numbers of patients with solid organ transplants who have been treated with MMF. Studying these patients has led to the following observations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Pneumocystis jirovecii</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although it is somewhat counterintuitive, there is some reason to believe that MMF exerts a protective effect against <em>P. jirovecii</em>. In animal models, MMF demonstrates an antimicrobial effect against this organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycophenolate-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Moreover, in four randomized, controlled trials of MMF in renal allograft transplant recipients, none of the 1068 patients who received MMF (compared with 10 of the 563 patients who did not) developed <em>P. jirovecii</em> infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycophenolate-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Viral infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In one study of heart transplant recipients, a higher incidence of herpes zoster was associated with MMF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycophenolate-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Of greater concern, however, is the risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. A higher incidence of tissue-invasive CMV infections has been documented in clinical trials of renal allograft recipients who received MMF as part of their immunosuppression regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycophenolate-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. This same increase in incidence of tissue-invasive CMV infections has not been observed in trials of patients treated with MMF who have received liver, heart, or lung transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycophenolate-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>].</p><p>Patients with rheumatic illness treated with MMF are presumably at risk for developing the same opportunistic infections seen in patients with solid organ transplants. These patient populations, however, may not be directly comparable. Patients with SLE, for example, are inherently more susceptible to infection than the general population. This may be due to a number of factors, including defects in chemotaxis, impaired phagocytosis, decreased immune complex clearance, abnormal complement levels, and mutations in mannose-binding lectin and Fc receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycophenolate-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Moreover, previous exposure to cytotoxic agents (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>) may have a prolonged effect on the immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycophenolate-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Even after the white blood cells in the peripheral circulation return to normal levels, there may be a delay in recovery of functional CD4 T lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycophenolate-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. These factors may make patients with rheumatic illnesses susceptible to a spectrum of opportunistic infections that is different from that of solid organ transplant patients treated with MMF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3485109708\"><span class=\"h3\">Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are case reports of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) occurring in patients who have received treatment with MMF.

These formulations have different absorption characteristics and should not be used interchangeably. EC-MPS has the potential to reduce the incidence of adverse gastrointestinal (GI) effects, principally diarrhea, by delaying release of MPA into the small intestine instead of the stomach. Both formulations are rapidly hydrolyzed to the active metabolite MPA. To convert from MMF (CellCept) 1000 mg every 12 hours, switch to EC-MPS (Myfortic) 720 mg every 12 hours.
