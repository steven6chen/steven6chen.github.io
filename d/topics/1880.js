Benign pigmented skin lesions, including lentigines, caf&eacute;-au-lait macules, Becker nevi, and dermal melanocytoses (Mongolian spots, nevus of Ota, and nevus of Ito), will be discussed below. Melanocytic nevi and melanocytic nevi variants are discussed separately.

In contrast to the ephelides (freckles) that are often seen in lightly pigmented children and fade in the absence of sun exposure, lentigines are persistent. There are two major types of lentigines: simple lentigo and solar lentigo. The mucosal melanotic macule is a variant of simple lentigo that is located on mucosal surfaces, in particular the lower lip.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Simple lentigo</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simple lentigines often appear during childhood as sharply circumscribed, round-to-oval, uniformly brown or brownish-black macules that are usually &lt;5 mm in diameter. There are typically few lesions, with no predilection for sun-exposed sites. However, multiple lentigines may be seen in a variety of disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66428\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66428 \">table 1</a>), and lentigines may increase in number or darken in patients with Addison's disease or other syndromes associated with elevated circulating levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone.

Mucosal melanotic macules may also occur on the oral mucosa and genitalia. Patients present with one or more brown to black macules, sometimes with irregular borders and mottled pigmentation. Genital lesions are occasionally &gt;1 cm in diameter.</p><p>Multiple perioral and oral mucosal melanotic macules characterize congenital disorders such as Peutz-Jeghers and Laugier-Hunziker syndromes. Multiple genital melanotic macules are a feature of Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (a type of PTEN hamartoma-tumor syndrome) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66428\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66428 \">table 1</a>).

Because the incidence of solar lentigines increases with age, they are most often seen in adults. However, solar lentigines can develop in fair-skinned children who have had significant sun exposure, especially on the shoulders following severe sunburns. Multiple tan to dark brown macules, often with irregular borders, are typically present; the lesions range from a few millimeters to &gt;1 cm in diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70005\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70005 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Children with xeroderma pigmentosum develop numerous solar lentigines at an unusually early age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66428\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66428 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuropathies associated with hereditary disorders&quot;, section on 'Xeroderma pigmentosum'</a>.)</p><p>Large, jagged solar lentigines are a characteristic finding in children with type 2 oculocutaneous albinism.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-melanocytic-nevi-moles#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired melanocytic nevi (moles)&quot;, section on 'Common acquired melanocytic nevi'</a>.)</p><p>The differential diagnosis of a genital melanotic macule that has irregular borders and pigmentation may include early acral lentiginous melanoma. However, acral lentiginous melanoma is unusual in children and adolescents; if there is no palpable component, a shave biopsy can be performed to make the distinction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathologic characteristics of melanoma&quot;, section on 'Acral lentiginous melanoma'</a>.)</p><p>In children, ephelides are the major consideration in the differential diagnosis of solar lentigines, since both are characterized by multiple pigmented macules in sun-exposed areas. However, ephelides fade in the winter, whereas solar lentigines are present year-round [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-pigmented-skin-lesions-other-than-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In adults, the differential diagnosis is primarily macular seborrheic keratoses and occasionally lentigo maligna.</p><p>Some variants of solar lentigines, such as ink-spot lentigines and tanning bed-induced lentigines, have dark pigmentation and a stellate outline that may result in consideration of early melanoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H10884070\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Melanoma: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Solar lentigines that are of cosmetic concern can be treated with liquid nitrogen cryotherapy, lasers that target melanin (eg, the Q-switched ruby laser), or intense pulsed light [broadband light].

In children and adolescents with solar lentigines, a skin examination should be included in the annual physical examination performed by the primary care provider. If the patient also has atypical or numerous nevi, or a family history of melanoma, then referral to a dermatologist is often warranted.

They represent localized areas of increased melanogenesis, the etiology of which is not known except when associated with conditions such as McCune-Albright syndrome (mosaic disorder due to a somatic mutation in the GNAS gene encoding the stimulatory G protein&rsquo;s alpha subunit) or neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1; results from loss-of-function mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene). Although several studies have shown that a single CALM can be found in 25 to 35 percent of children, &lt;1 percent of children have &ge;3 CALM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-pigmented-skin-lesions-other-than-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-and-inherited-hyperpigmentation-disorders#H391320714\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital and inherited hyperpigmentation disorders&quot;, section on 'Genetic syndromes associated with caf&eacute;-au-lait macules'</a>.)</p><p>CALM range from a few millimeters to &gt;15 cm in size, and they enlarge in proportion to the growth of the child. Their color varies from tan to dark brown and is usually uniform, although in some cases perifollicular hypopigmentation or a few darker macules may be apparent within the lesions. In general, the color of CALM is a few shades darker than that of the uninvolved skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-pigmented-skin-lesions-other-than-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Interestingly, CALM that occur within a Mongolian spot are often surrounded by a halo of normally pigmented skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-pigmented-skin-lesions-other-than-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-skin-and-scalp-lesions-in-the-newborn-and-infant#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign skin and scalp lesions in the newborn and infant&quot;, section on 'Congenital dermal melanocytosis (Mongolian spot)'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with &quot;pigmentary mosaicism&quot; (including the small subset with McCune-Albright syndrome), CALM may have a block-like distribution with midline demarcation and an irregular, jagged outline (&quot;coast of Maine&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F96333\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96333 \">picture 3</a>). Some authors refer to this as &quot;segmental pigmentation disorder.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pigmentary mosaicism (hypomelanosis of Ito)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, CALM in patients with NF1 and related conditions classically have a relatively smooth border (&quot;coast of California&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F50599\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50599 \">picture 2C</a>). Patients with NF1 also tend to have greater numbers of CALM in a more widespread distribution (with the exception of segmental NF1). These CALM have been referred to as &quot;typical&quot; based on their regular borders and uniform pigmentation. Larger CALM in individuals with NF1 should be palpated to exclude the possibility of an underlying plexiform neurofibroma. Histologic features cannot differentiate among CALM in patients with McCune-Albright syndrome, other forms of &quot;pigmentary mosaicism,&quot; and NF1. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Hyperpigmented patches over the posterior axis are occasionally associated with underlying spinal dysraphism, especially in the presence of additional cutaneous findings such as focal hypertrichosis or a lipoma. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a neonate, the differential diagnosis of a single CALM includes the initial stage of a speckled lentiginous nevus (ie, before the appearance of superimposed &quot;spots&quot;) or a relatively flat congenital melanocytic nevus (which will likely become more elevated over time). Additional diagnostic considerations may include a mastocytoma, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, and phytophotodermatitis. </p><p>A Becker nevus should be considered for large, solitary lesions that break up into smaller macules at their periphery (with or without associated hypertrichosis), particularly when located on the upper lateral trunk or when onset occurs around the time of puberty. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Becker nevus'</a> below.)</p><p>The key question in the evaluation of a child with multiple CALM is whether these lesions represent a cutaneous marker of an underlying systemic disorder. In a longitudinal study of 41 children with &ge;6 CALM, 24 (60 percent) were found to have NF1, six had segmental NF1, and three were diagnosed with other syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66428\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66428 \">table 1</a>); only eight (20 percent) had no manifestations of an associated condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-pigmented-skin-lesions-other-than-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In another retrospective study of 110 children (median age three years) who presented with CALM but no other features of NF1, 34 of 44 (77 percent) of those with &ge;6 &quot;typical&quot; CALM (distinct regular borders, uniform pigmentation) eventually met criteria for NF1 (almost all before age six years). In contrast, 2 of 15 (15 percent) of those with &ge;6 &quot;atypical&quot; CALM (irregular borders, nonhomogeneous pigmentation) and zero of 51 of those with &lt;6 CALM eventually met criteria for NF1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-pigmented-skin-lesions-other-than-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The presence of &ge;6 CALM (measuring &ge;1.5 cm in adults and &ge;0.5 cm in prepubertal children) is a criterion for the diagnosis of NF1 that is met by 90 percent of patients by early adulthood. Segmental NF1 (due to mosaicism for a mutation in the NF1 gene) can present with various combinations of multiple CALM, &quot;freckling&quot; (multiple small lentigines), or neurofibromas; the pigmentary abnormalities may have a block-like distribution pattern or follow the lines of Blaschko. In contrast to NF1, multiple CALM are found in a minority of patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2; bilateral vestibular schwannomas), making their presence less useful in establishing the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurofibromatosis-type-1-nf1-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1): Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The NF1-like Legius syndrome, which is secondary to a loss-of-function germline mutation in the <em>SPRED1</em> gene, has a cutaneous phenotype that partially overlaps with that of NF1 (CALM, freckling) but lacks neurofibromas or Lisch nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-pigmented-skin-lesions-other-than-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Pigmentary disorders that can present with multiple CALM include piebaldism (CALM in leukodermic and uninvolved skin) and familial progressive hyper- and hypopigmentation. Other conditions associated with multiple CALM include Noonan syndrome, LEOPARD syndrome, constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome (childhood tumor syndrome with NF1 phenotype), ataxia-telangiectasia, PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome, Russell-Silver syndrome, and Bloom syndrome.

However, multiple treatment sessions are usually required, responses are variable, recurrences are common, and there is a risk of side effects such as persistent hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation.

Referral to a pediatric dermatologist or specialized NF1 clinic can also be considered. Of note, comprehensive testing of the NF1 gene is clinically available and can identify the underlying mutation in &ge;95 percent of non-founder patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for NF1, allowing an accurate diagnosis to be made in young children who do not (yet) meet these criteria.

Becker nevi can be present at birth, but the majority are first noticed around puberty. This timing, along with the male-to-female ratio of 5:1, the increase in the number of terminal hairs seen within many lesions, and reports of acne vulgaris localized to Becker nevi has raised the possibility of androgenic stimulation as an underlying factor in their pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-pigmented-skin-lesions-other-than-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>A Becker nevus classically manifests unilaterally on the shoulder and upper trunk as a tan to brown patch or thin plaque. Less often, lesions occur on the lower trunk, thigh, or in other sites. The margins are usually irregular and break up into &quot;islands&quot; at the periphery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68895\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68895 \">picture 4</a>); the average diameter is &gt;10 cm.

These lesions differ from Mongolian spots clinically in their mottled rather than uniform pigmentation, and histologically in their greater density of melanocytes within the upper reticular dermis.</p><p>Nevus of Ota occurs most commonly in Asians and blacks. The incidence in Japan, for example, is 1 to 2 per 1000. The female to male ratio is approximately 4:1. Up to 15 percent of lesions harbor somatic activating mutations in the <em>GNAQ </em>and <em>GNA11</em> genes encoding G protein alpha subunits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-pigmented-skin-lesions-other-than-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The pigmentation is present at birth or within the first year of life in more than one-half of cases, and in the remainder it becomes apparent around puberty; in both instances, the lesions persist.
