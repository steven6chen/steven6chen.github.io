Infection is transmitted via inhalation in endemic areas. Outside of North America, blastomycosis has been reported most frequently in Africa with occasional cases identified in Mexico, Central and South America, India, and the Middle East. The incubation period from exposure until the onset of pulmonary symptoms is approximately three to six weeks. The diagnosis is established via culture; a presumptive diagnosis of blastomycosis may be made by visualization of the characteristic yeast form in clinical specimens.

Pneumonic plague can be primary (eg, acquired by inhalation of respiratory secretions or aerosolized droplets from infected animals or humans or by laboratory exposure) or secondary (eg, developing in the setting of bubonic or septicemic plague). The disease occurs in the southwestern United States, the former Soviet Union, and foci in Africa, Asia, and South America. The incubation period is two to eight days; the diagnosis is established by isolation of the organism in culture, serologic testing, or rapid testing in some circumstances.

Cysticercosis is endemic in many regions of Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Asia. The median incubation period for cysticercosis is about 3.5 years.
