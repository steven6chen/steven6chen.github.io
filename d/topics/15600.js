Although the mechanism of action for serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) is similar, the structures of duloxetine, milnacipran, and venlafaxine are dissimilar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/3,4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,6</a>]. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2257250\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacodynamics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The SNRIs appear to treat depression by initially blocking presynaptic serotonin and norepinephrine transporter proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>]. This inhibits reuptake of these neurotransmitters, which changes various homeostatic mechanisms, and ultimately increases stimulation of postsynaptic receptors. However, the SNRIs vary in their affinity for the serotonin transporter and norepinephrine transporter. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desvenlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Desvenlafaxine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> are more potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake than norepinephrine reuptake, whereas <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levomilnacipran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levomilnacipran</a> preferentially blocks reuptake of norepinephrine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p>SNRIs are often referred to as &ldquo;dual action agents&rdquo;; however, the degree to which reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine is inhibited depends upon the dose administered. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> is essentially a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) at 75 mg per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. At higher doses, such as 225 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and 375 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> venlafaxine has significant effects on the norepinephrine transporter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. By contrast, low doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levomilnacipran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levomilnacipran</a> block reuptake of norepinephrine approximately two times more potently than serotonin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, levomilnacipran doses &ge;40 mg per day inhibit 90 percent of norepinephrine reuptake and 80 percent of serotonin reuptake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (All of these estimates are based upon indirect measures and group means.) &#160;</p><p>For treating unipolar major depression, drugs that block reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine appear to be more efficacious than SSRIs, but the advantage is small. A pooled analysis of 93 randomized trials (n&gt;17,000 patients) compared dual action agents with SSRIs and found that response occurred in more patients treated with dual action drugs (64 versus 59 percent); although the difference was statistically significant, the magnitude was modest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Choosing an antidepressant for treating major depression is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-choosing-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-of-resistant-depression\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Treatment of resistant depression&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>The SNRIs have little or no effect upon alpha1-adrenergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic, or histaminergic receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. However, these drugs stimulate norepinephrine receptors in the sympathetic nervous system, which leads to a relative decrease in parasympathetic tone; this can cause &ldquo;pseudoanticholinergic&rdquo; side effects (eg, constipation, dry mouth, and urinary retention), despite the lack of direct effects upon cholinergic receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276509802\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacokinetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pharmacokinetic parameters of SNRIs vary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F88063\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88063 \">table 1</a>). Food decreases the rate but not the degree of absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]; administering the drugs with food may reduce nausea, which is generally the most common side effect of SNRIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Duloxetine</a> is similar to SSRIs and tricyclics in that it is highly protein bound, clearance is primarily hepatic, and &lt;1 percent of the drug is eliminated unchanged in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. By contrast, the other SNRIs are less protein bound, renal excretion of the drugs plays a larger role in their clearance, more of the drug is excreted unchanged in urine, and dose adjustment is more likely to be required in the presence of renal disease. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levomilnacipran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levomilnacipran</a> is only 22 percent bound to plasma proteins, and 58 percent is excreted unchanged in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Due to interindividual differences in the clearance of the SNRIs, steady state plasma concentrations of these drugs can vary substantially between individuals, resulting in the need for individual dose adjustments to attain the desired clinical effect. The dose of SNRIs is reduced in patients with hepatic or renal disease; dosing is discussed below in each section that describes a specific drug. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276509825\"><span class=\"h3\">Drug-drug interactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Duloxetine</a> is a moderately potent inhibitor of the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 and may thus interact with other drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

Patients should also be informed that although some response may occur within the first two weeks of treatment, it may take many weeks (eg, 8 to 14) for a full response (severity of illness and comorbid disease may affect how quickly depressed patients respond to treatment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>In addition, clinicians should caution patients to not abruptly discontinue antidepressants, which may precipitate chills, dizziness, dysphoria, fatigue, gastrointestinal distress, and myalgias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. This discontinuation syndrome appears to be particularly common with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> and relatively uncommon with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milnacipran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milnacipran</a>. Additional information about the discontinuation syndrome is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discontinuing-antidepressant-medications-in-adults#H209967\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discontinuing antidepressant medications in adults&quot;, section on 'Discontinuation symptoms'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276509622\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical tests, plasma levels, and monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No specific medical tests are required before starting SNRIs, and drug serum concentrations are not routinely monitored because they have not been shown to correlate with clinical response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, drug levels can assess adherence, whether unresponsive patients are rapid metabolizers, and whether poorly tolerant patients are slow metabolizers. &#160;</p><p>With the exception of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>, the SNRIs may increase blood pressure. Thus, blood pressure should be assessed prior to starting an SNRI and monitored during treatment. If blood pressure is elevated prior to treatment, appropriate antihypertensive treatment should be instituted or adjusted prior to starting the SNRI, or alternative antidepressants should be used. For patients receiving SNRIs, blood pressure is initially checked every one to two weeks for the first month of treatment, and then every one to two months for the next six months of treatment. Thereafter, monitoring occurs every three to six months. This schedule may be adjusted depending upon the SNRI and the dose; as an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> at a low dose (eg, 75 mg per day) would be expected to have minimal effects upon blood pressure. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276509636\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest starting SNRIs with a low dose in order to avoid side effects, and slowly increasing the dose to the lowest dose that provides the desired clinical response. Starting doses and target dose ranges of each SNRI are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53818 \">table 3</a>). Depressed patients with comorbid anxiety disorders and older adult patients may tolerate the medication better by starting with half of the suggested dose. Doses are adjusted according to patient response, tolerability, and clinical urgency. </p><p>Finding the effective dose of an antidepressant involves trial and error. After starting the antidepressant and titrating up to the minimum target dose, response should be monitored over the next two to four weeks. For patients who tolerate the drug, but show no improvement, we increase the dose. For patients who show continuing improvement, we allow more time. If improvement plateaus, we increase the dose again. A full trial will take from 6 to 12 weeks. The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial, one of the largest systematic trials in the United States, found that two-thirds of patients who responded (improvement from baseline &ge;50 percent) did so in the first six weeks, but half of the patients who achieved remission did so during weeks 6 to 12 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

A pooled analysis of four randomized trials compared the efficacy of venlafaxine in 464 patients with unipolar major depression who all received the drug and were classified as extensive or poor metabolizers based upon the plasma concentration ratio of desvenlafaxine to venlafaxine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Remission was greater in patients who were extensive metabolizers compared with poor metabolizers (56 versus 37 percent); the venlafaxine dose and tolerability were comparable for the two groups. A possible explanation for this counterintuitive effect is that extensive metabolizers convert more venlafaxine to desvenlafaxine, and desvenlafaxine may have a greater antidepressant effect. However, it is not known whether the effectiveness of venlafaxine is diminished by medications that inhibit CYP2D6.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SNRIs appear to treat depression by initially blocking presynaptic serotonin and norepinephrine transporter proteins. This inhibits reuptake of these neurotransmitters and leads to increased stimulation of postsynaptic receptors. (See <a href=\"#H2257250\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacodynamics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pharmacokinetic parameters of SNRIs vary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F88063\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88063 \">table 1</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Duloxetine</a> moderately inhibits the hepatic enzyme CYP2D6. (See <a href=\"#H276509802\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacokinetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to prescribing SNRIs, clinicians should discuss drug interactions, side effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62488\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62488 \">table 2</a>), time to response, and stopping the medication. (See <a href=\"#H276509615\" class=\"local\">'Guidelines to review with patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No specific medical tests are required before starting SNRIs, although assessing baseline blood pressure is advisable for several of the SNRIs. Drug serum concentrations are not routinely performed. (See <a href=\"#H276509622\" class=\"local\">'Medical tests, plasma levels, and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest starting SNRIs at a low dose to assess tolerance, and within a week, advancing to the minimal effective dose. Thereafter, the dose can be increased in unresponsive patients who tolerate the drug. Starting doses and target dose ranges of each SNRI are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53818 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H276509636\" class=\"local\">'Dose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administering SNRIs with food may reduce nausea, which is the most common side effect. (See <a href=\"#H85891991\" class=\"local\">'Administration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SNRIs can cause side effects; nausea is most common. Other side effects include constipation, dizziness, dry mouth, and sweating. With the exception of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>, the SNRIs can raise blood pressure, which should be monitored. All drugs that inhibit serotonin uptake can cause sexual dysfunction. Chronic use (eg, &ge;6 months) of SNRIs can lead to substantial weight gain (eg, 5 kg). (See <a href=\"#H18324389\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abrupt discontinuation of SNRIs can cause discontinuation symptoms; thus, we advise tapering these drugs before stopping them. Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levomilnacipran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levomilnacipran</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milnacipran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milnacipran</a> are less likely to cause discontinuation symptoms, tapering is still preferred if time permits.
