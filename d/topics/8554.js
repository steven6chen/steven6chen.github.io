Hypoparathyroidism occurs when there is destruction of the parathyroid glands (autoimmune, surgical), abnormal parathyroid gland development, altered regulation of PTH production, or impaired PTH action (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F100461\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100461 \">table 1</a>). When PTH secretion is insufficient, hypocalcemia develops. Hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism may be associated with a spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from few if any symptoms, if the hypocalcemia is mild, to life-threatening seizures, refractory heart failure, or laryngospasm if it is severe.

In adults, the most common cause is surgical. In a retrospective analysis of adults evaluated in a metabolic bone unit of an endocrinology service in Brazil, over 80 percent of cases of acquired hypoparathyroidism were postsurgical, whereas less than 20 percent were autoimmune [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoparathyroidism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postsurgical</strong> &ndash; Postsurgical hypoparathyroidism can occur after thyroid, parathyroid, or radical neck surgery for head and neck cancer, and it may be transient, with recovery in days, weeks, or months; permanent; or even intermittent. In observational studies, transient hypoparathyroidism occurred in up to 20 percent of patients after surgery for thyroid cancer, and permanent hypoparathyroidism in 0.8 to 3.0 percent of patients after total thyroidectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoparathyroidism/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Permanent hypoparathyroidism occurs particularly when the goiter is extensive and anatomic landmarks are displaced and obscured during surgery. Transient hypoparathyroidism may be due to manipulation of the blood supply to or removal of one or more parathyroid glands during surgery, whereas intermittent hypoparathyroidism is due to decreased parathyroid reserve (parathyroid insufficiency). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiated-thyroid-cancer-surgical-treatment#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiated thyroid cancer: Surgical treatment&quot;, section on 'Hypoparathyroidism'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism#H10949435\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of hyperthyroidism&quot;, section on 'Hypocalcemia'</a> and <a href=\"#H128985\" class=\"local\">'Parathyroid insufficiency'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Autoimmune</strong> &ndash; Immune-mediated destruction of the parathyroid glands typically results in permanent hypoparathyroidism. Permanent hypoparathyroidism is part of the autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy syndrome, also known as polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type 1 (PAS 1). It is a result of mutations in the autoimmune regulator (<em>AIRE</em>) gene. Hypoparathyroidism typically appears during childhood or adolescence.

Activating antibodies to the CaSR have been reported in patients with isolated acquired hypoparathyroidism and in patients with hypoparathyroidism associated with polyglandular autoimmune syndrome. These antibodies decrease parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion but do not appear to be destructive.

The symptoms of tetany may be mild (perioral numbness, paresthesias of the hands and feet, muscle cramps) or severe (carpopedal spasm, laryngospasm, and focal or generalized seizures, which must be distinguished from the generalized tonic muscle contractions that occur in severe tetany). The classic physical findings in patients with neuromuscular irritability due to latent tetany are Trousseau's and Chvostek's signs.

Moniliasis precedes the other immune disorders and first appears during childhood or adolescence. This disorder is associated with defective cellular immunity that persists despite correction of hypocalcemia. The nails, skin, and gastrointestinal tract are typically involved. The moniliasis is often refractory to antifungal therapy. Other associated clinical manifestations of PAS 1 include those of adrenal insufficiency and, less frequently, those of other autoimmune disorders.

In addition to these findings, most patients with hypoparathyroidism have an elevated serum phosphorus level. Patients with hypoparathyroidism typically have normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), normal or low 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) concentrations (because of the reduced capacity of PTH to stimulate renal production of 1,25D), and normal magnesium and creatinine levels.</p><p>Although hypocalciuria is a feature of all hypocalcemic states due to a decreased filtered load, urinary calcium excretion is relatively high in patients with hypoparathyroidism because of loss of the stimulatory effect of PTH on renal tubular calcium reabsorption. Therefore, frank hypercalciuria can occur as the serum calcium concentration is raised toward normal, and concern about hypercalciuria and possible nephrolithiasis may prevent full correction of hypocalcemia. (See <a href=\"#H1745331\" class=\"local\">'Preventing hypercalciuria'</a> below.)</p><p>In contrast to relatively high urinary calcium excretion noted in patients with hypoparathyroidism, loss of the inhibitory effect of PTH on renal tubular phosphorus reabsorption can result in reduced renal phosphorus excretion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1747102\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent hypocalcemia with a low or inappropriately normal parathyroid hormone (PTH) level and hyperphosphatemia is, in the absence of hypomagnesemia, virtually diagnostic of hypoparathyroidism (PTH deficiency).</p><p>Although the diagnosis of postsurgical hypoparathyroidism is usually obvious in a patient who has acute onset of symptoms of hypocalcemia (eg, neuromuscular irritability) immediately following neck surgery, hypoparathyroidism should also be suspected in any patient with mild (perioral numbness, paresthesias of the hands and feet, muscle cramps) or severe (carpopedal spasm, laryngospasm, and focal or generalized seizures) symptoms of neuromuscular irritability. The diagnosis is confirmed by simultaneously measuring serum total calcium, albumin, magnesium, and intact PTH levels. In patients with hypoalbuminemia or hyperalbuminemia, the measured serum calcium concentration should be corrected for the abnormality in albumin [(<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-calcium-correction-in-hypoalbuminemia\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) or for the international system of units, (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-calcium-correction-in-hypoalbuminemia-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>)]. If a laboratory known to measure ionized calcium reliably is available, measurement of serum ionized calcium is an alternative to determining corrected serum calcium, although few laboratories offer this service. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypocalcemia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypocalcemia&quot;, section on 'Interpretation of serum calcium'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, hypoparathyroidism should be suspected in patients who are incidentally noted to have a low serum total calcium or low ionized calcium, particularly when there is a personal or family history of autoimmune diseases, past history of head and neck surgery, or the presence of a neck scar. Such patients may have mild symptoms of hypocalcemia (eg, muscle cramps) or no symptoms. The presence of a low serum calcium concentration should be confirmed by repeat sampling and corrected for albumin, if needed. Serum intact PTH, creatinine, phosphorus, and magnesium should be measured to determine the cause of the hypocalcemia. Serum PTH can be interpreted correctly only when serum calcium is measured simultaneously. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-hypocalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to hypocalcemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1747080\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The combination of low or inappropriately normal intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) with a low corrected serum calcium may also be found in patients with hypomagnesemia and in patients with an activating mutation of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) or its downstream pathway. Although kidney disease, vitamin D deficiency (as diagnosed by low 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]), and pancreatitis may all cause hypocalcemia, PTH levels are generally increased rather than decreased in association with the low serum calcium in these other clinical conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hypocalcemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hypocalcemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hypomagnesemia (serum magnesium concentration below 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> causes hypocalcemia by inducing PTH resistance or deficiency. It is therefore a reversible cause of hypocalcemia associated with low or inappropriately normal PTH. Hypocalcemia should resolve within minutes or hours after restoration of normal serum magnesium concentrations if hypomagnesemia was the cause of the hypocalcemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-magnesium-depletion#H1626805\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of magnesium depletion&quot;, section on 'Hypoparathyroidism and parathyroid hormone resistance'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypomagnesemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypomagnesemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-hypomagnesemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of hypomagnesemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Activating mutations of CaSR that decrease the set point of CaSR, so that PTH is not released at serum calcium concentrations that normally trigger PTH release, give rise to familial or autosomal dominant hypocalcemia or to sporadic disease. The majority of patients with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia are asymptomatic and therefore are not diagnosed until adulthood, when hypocalcemia is incidentally noted. The usual biochemical tests do not reliably discriminate this disorder from other forms of PTH-deficient hypoparathyroidism. The major clinical clues to this syndrome are the absence of symptoms, its familial nature, and the tendency of patients to develop renal complications during treatment with calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The diagnosis can be confirmed by analysis for mutations in the <em>CaSR</em> gene or its downstream pathway.

Although polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type 1 (PAS 1) usually presents in childhood, components of the syndrome, including hypoparathyroidism, may occur in early adult life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoparathyroidism/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Consequently, on the rare occasion that an adult patient presents with hypoparathyroidism and a history of one component of PAS 1 such as candidiasis, it would be important to assess adrenal function to exclude adrenal insufficiency and to consider assessment for an autoimmune regulator (<em>AIRE</em>) gene mutation.

(See <a href=\"#H3285899367\" class=\"local\">'Acute hypoparathyroidism'</a> below and <a href=\"#H128510\" class=\"local\">'Chronic hypoparathyroidism'</a> below.)</p><p>The goals of therapy in patients with hypoparathyroidism are to relieve symptoms, to raise and maintain the serum calcium concentration in the low-normal range, eg, 8.0 to 8.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.0 to 2.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> and to prevent iatrogenic development of kidney stones. Attainment of higher serum calcium values is not necessary and is usually limited by the development of hypercalciuria due to the loss of renal calcium-retaining effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH).

In addition, vitamin D-deficient patients undergoing parathyroidectomy are at increased risk for developing hungry bone syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoparathyroidism/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Hungry bone syndrome most often occurs in hyperparathyroid patients who developed bone disease preoperatively due to a chronic increase in bone resorption induced by high levels of PTH (osteitis fibrosa).

Calcitriol is the most active metabolite of vitamin D. Other advantages of calcitriol include rapid onset of action (hours) and a biologic half-life of approximately four to six hours. While hypercalcemia is more common during treatment with calcitriol than with vitamin D, cessation of treatment is followed by resolution of hypercalcemia in a few days rather than a few weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoparathyroidism/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alfacalcidol-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Alfacalcidol</a> (1-alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3) is a synthetic analog of vitamin D that is converted in the liver to the active metabolite 1,25D.

However, intact PTH concentrations remain low to normal, suggesting that PTH does not mediate the late partum rise in 1,25D production. The increase in serum 1,25D may be regulated by other pregnancy hormones, which are normal in hypoparathyroid women, such as PTH-related protein (PTHrP), prolactin, estrogen, and placental growth hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoparathyroidism/abstract/46,54,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,54,56</a>].</p><p>Thus, serum calcium concentrations should be measured frequently during late pregnancy and lactation in women with hypoparathyroidism, who may have a rise in serum calcium requiring a decrease in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoparathyroidism/abstract/46-48,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48,54</a>]. If the calcitriol dose is not reduced, the combination of elevated serum 1,25D and PTHrP can lead to increases in intestinal absorption and bone resorption and hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoparathyroidism/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The requirement for calcitriol will return to antepartum levels with cessation of lactation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1747115\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoparathyroidism occurs when there is destruction of the parathyroid glands (surgical, autoimmune), abnormal parathyroid gland development, altered regulation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) production, or impaired PTH action (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F100461\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100461 \">table 1</a>). Acquired hypoparathyroidism is most often the result of postsurgical or autoimmune damage to the parathyroid glands. (See <a href=\"#H1747095\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoparathyroidism may be associated with a spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from few if any symptoms if hypocalcemia is mild, to life-threatening seizures, refractory heart failure, or laryngospasm if it is severe. In addition to severity, the rate of development of hypocalcemia and chronicity determine the clinical manifestations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62347\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62347 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1747052\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoparathyroidism should be suspected in patients with mild (perioral numbness, paresthesias of the hands and feet, muscle cramps) or severe (carpopedal spasm, laryngospasm, and focal or generalized seizures) symptoms of neuromuscular irritability or in asymptomatic patients who are incidentally noted to have a low serum total calcium, particularly when there is a personal or family history of autoimmune diseases, past history of head and neck surgery, or the presence of a neck scar.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The diagnosis is confirmed by simultaneously measuring serum total calcium, albumin, magnesium, phosphorus, and intact PTH levels. In patients with hypoalbuminemia or hyperalbuminemia, the measured serum calcium concentration should be corrected for the abnormality in albumin [(<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-calcium-correction-in-hypoalbuminemia\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>), or for the international system of units, (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-calcium-correction-in-hypoalbuminemia-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>)], or ionized calcium should be determined. Persistent hypocalcemia with a low or inappropriately normal PTH level and hyperphosphatemia is, in the absence of hypomagnesemia, virtually diagnostic of hypoparathyroidism (PTH deficiency). (See <a href=\"#H1747102\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combination of low or inappropriately normal intact PTH with a low corrected serum calcium may also be found in patients with hypomagnesemia and in patients with an activating mutation of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). (See <a href=\"#H1747080\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-magnesium-depletion#H1626805\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of magnesium depletion&quot;, section on 'Hypoparathyroidism and parathyroid hormone resistance'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-hypomagnesemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of hypomagnesemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders of the calcium-sensing receptor: Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia&quot;, section on 'Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute hypoparathyroidism can occur after total or near-total thyroidectomy. Monitoring for hypocalcemia after near-total or total thyroidectomy is necessary. Serum calcium and albumin should be measured on the evening of surgery and the next morning. Oral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intravenous calcium and oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> supplementation should be administered based upon the results of the serum calcium corrected for albumin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59019\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59019 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H128606\" class=\"local\">'Postsurgical hypoparathyroidism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with acute hypoparathyroidism have a rapid decline in serum calcium and PTH, precipitating acute symptoms. Emergency therapy is indicated in patients with tetany, seizures, or markedly prolonged QT intervals on electrocardiogram.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In adults, treatment is initiated with the intravenous administration of one 10 mL ampule of 10 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a> (90 mg of elemental calcium per 10 mL) in 50 mL of 5 percent dextrose infused over 10 to 20 minutes, followed by an intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In children, acute management is with intravenous administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a> (90 mg elemental <span class=\"nowrap\">calcium/10</span> mL vial) at a slow rate (not greater than 2 mL [1.86 mg of elemental <span class=\"nowrap\">calcium]/kg</span> over 10 minutes) while closely monitoring pulse rate (and the QT interval).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For asymptomatic patients with an acute decrease in serum corrected calcium to &le;7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> we also suggest intravenous calcium therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3285899367\" class=\"local\">'Acute hypoparathyroidism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For adults with milder degrees of symptoms (eg, paresthesias) and hypocalcemia (corrected serum calcium &gt;7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> initial treatment with oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation is sufficient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59019\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59019 \">table 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the initial management of patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism, we suggest calcium and vitamin D supplementation rather than recombinant human PTH (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Calcitriol</a> is the vitamin D metabolite of choice because it does not require renal activation, has a rapid onset of action (hours), and has a shorter half-life. Other acceptable vitamin D analogs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alfacalcidol-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alfacalcidol</a> or dihydrotachysterol (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F58328\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58328 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H128712\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The addition of recombinant PTH 1-84 is an option for patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism who cannot maintain stable serum and urinary calcium levels with calcium and vitamin D supplementation. (See <a href=\"#H1745451\" class=\"local\">'Recombinant human PTH'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring of urinary and serum calcium and serum phosphate is required weekly initially, until a stable serum calcium concentration (at the low end of the normal range) is reached. Thereafter, monitoring at three- to six-month intervals is likely sufficient. (See <a href=\"#H1745285\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of therapy in patients with hypoparathyroidism are to relieve symptoms, to raise and maintain the serum calcium concentration in the low normal range (eg, 8.0 to 8.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [2.0 to 2.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> and to prevent iatrogenic development of kidney stones. Attainment of higher values is not necessary and is usually limited by the development of hypercalciuria due to the loss of renal calcium-retaining effects of PTH.
