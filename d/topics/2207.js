By contrast, in Tanzania and areas of central Africa, breast cancer accounts for up to 6 percent of cancers in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Higher rates of male breast cancer in central and eastern Africa may be related to endemic hepatic infectious diseases that lead to hyperestrogenism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p>As with women, the incidence of breast cancer in men rises with age, although men tend to be approximately 5 to 10 years older than women at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/3,7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7-12</a>]. The annual incidence of breast cancer in men appears to be rising; one report suggests that incidence has increased 26 percent over the past 25 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast cancers in men appear to share similar risk factors with postmenopausal breast cancer in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Systematic reviews of the literature have summarized the factors associated with breast cancer in men, and these are reviewed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Despite these reported associations, the vast majority of men with breast cancer have no identifiable risk factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F96401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96401 \">table 1</a>). &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103850683\"><span class=\"h3\">Genetics and family history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with breast cancer in women, a family history of breast cancer in a male first-degree relative is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer among men. Approximately 15 to 20 percent of men with breast cancer have a family history of the disease compared with only 7 percent of the general male population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As is the case in women, two <span class=\"nowrap\">breast/ovarian</span> cancer genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, are thought to account for 80 percent of multiple-case breast cancer families. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling and testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Inherited mutations in BRCA also increase the risk of breast cancer in men, although the risk appears to be higher with inherited BRCA2 rather than BRCA1 mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>]. Men who inherit germline BRCA2 mutations have an estimated 6 percent lifetime absolute risk of breast cancer; this represents a 100-fold higher risk than in the general male population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Genetic factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevalence-of-brca1-and-brca2-mutations-and-associated-cancer-risks#H1039356841\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and associated cancer risks&quot;, section on 'Cancers in men'</a>.)</p><p>The incidence of BRCA mutations varies based upon ethnicity and strength of family history (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F80912\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80912 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/18,23-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,23-32</a>]. As an example, in a population-based series of men with breast cancer unselected for family history, 0 to 4 percent have BRCA1 mutations, while between 5 and 15 percent have BRCA2 mutations. Because of this, all men diagnosed with breast cancer should be referred for genetic counseling and BRCA testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F107534\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107534 \">table 3</a>). Cancer surveillance of men with a BRCA mutation is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling and testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patients at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Genes other than BRCA may be involved in predisposition to breast cancer in men. Mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene, which is linked to Cowden's syndrome; mutations in TP53 (Li-Fraumeni syndrome); PALB2 mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]; and mutations in mismatch repair genes associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch) syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], have been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in men. However, while such findings may raise the relative risk of breast cancer in men in whom the mutation was identified (compared with men without such mutation), the absolute risk of male breast cancer is still quite low. Therefore, we would not advise screening mammography or prophylactic mastectomy in affected male individuals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pten-hamartoma-tumor-syndrome-including-cowden-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome, including Cowden syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=li-fraumeni-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Li-Fraumeni syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes#H21474166\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes&quot;, section on 'Lynch syndrome'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes#H21474661\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes&quot;, section on 'PALB2'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103851565\"><span class=\"h3\">Alterations of the estrogen to androgen ratio</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive estrogen stimulation may be due to hormonal therapies (eg, estrogen-containing compounds or testosterone), hepatic dysfunction, obesity, marijuana use, thyroid disease, or an inherited condition, such as Klinefelter syndrome.</p><p>Klinefelter syndrome is a rare condition resulting from the inheritance of an additional X chromosome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/7,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,36-38</a>]. The Klinefelter syndrome consists of atrophic testes, gynecomastia, high serum concentrations of gonadotropins (follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone), and low serum testosterone levels; the net effect is a high ratio of estrogen to testosterone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-primary-hypogonadism-in-males\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of primary hypogonadism in males&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Few carefully conducted epidemiologic studies have been undertaken, given the rarity of both Klinefelter syndrome and male breast cancer. The largest cohort study of 3518 men who were cytogenetically diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome found 19 and 58-fold increases in incidence of and mortality from breast cancer, respectively, compared with the general population, with particularly high risks among men who were 47,XXY genotyped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Additional studies are needed to clarify which men with Klinefelter syndrome are at a high risk of developing breast cancer, and to define the contribution of possible predisposing factors, including altered endogenous hormones. </p><p>The role of breast cancer screening in men with Klinefelter syndrome is unclear. Although routine mammography is not advocated for all affected men, the importance of patient education, self-examination, and regular clinician examinations is stressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103851723\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary testicular conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testicular conditions associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in men include orchitis, undescended testes (cryptorchidism), and testicular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/7,11,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,40</a>]. While speculative, it may be that these conditions may be associated with lower androgen production, resulting in a higher than normal estrogen to androgen ratio. However, this remains speculative. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGIC FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although most histologic subtypes of breast cancer seen in women are also present in men, men with breast cancer are rarely diagnosed with lobular carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>Approximately 90 percent of breast cancers in men are invasive ductal carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/13,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,42-44</a>]. In contrast, lobular cancers accounted for 1.5 percent of cases in one series of 2000 men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], while they account for up to 15 percent of cases in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The lack of a lobular histologic subtype is due to lack of acini and lobules in the normal male breast, although these can be induced in the context of estrogenic stimulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to differences in the invasive carcinoma, there are differences in the incidence and clinical characteristics of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast ductal carcinoma in situ: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paget-disease-of-the-breast\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paget disease of the breast&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inflammatory-breast-cancer-clinical-features-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inflammatory breast cancer: Clinical features and treatment&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DCIS accounts for a significantly higher proportion of breast cancers in women compared with men (approximately 20 versus 7 to 11 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/13,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,46,47</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DCIS in men tends to occur at a later age, presents more frequently in an intraductal papillary form, and is more often low grade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paget disease and inflammatory breast cancer have been rarely described in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/43,49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,49-51</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12666714\"><span class=\"h2\">Breast cancer subtype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As in postmenopausal women, the most common subtype of breast cancer in men is hormone receptor-positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/9,12,13,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,13,52</a>]. However, there are differences in the molecular characteristics of breast cancer associated with both age and ethnicity, although these do not appear to influence survival outcomes. This was shown in a registry study involving 829 men with primary breast cancer diagnosed between 2005 and 2009 (71, 11, and 7 percent who were non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, or non-Hispanic black, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Major findings were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>82, 15, and 4 percent had hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, and triple-negative breast cancers, respectively. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with a HER2-positive tumor. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-Hispanic black men were more likely to have triple-negative breast cancer compared with non-Hispanic white or Hispanic men (9 versus 3 and 6 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Male breast cancer is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage, most likely due to a lack of awareness that men can develop breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Most men with breast cancer generally present with a painless, firm mass that is usually subareolar, with nipple involvement ranging between 40 and 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/9,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,54</a>]. The left breast is involved slightly more often than the right, and less than 1 percent of cases are bilateral. There may be associated skin changes, including nipple retraction, ulceration, or fixation of the mass to the skin or underlying tissues. Axillary adenopathy is typically palpable in advanced cases. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of a breast mass in a man includes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gynecomastia &ndash; Gynecomastia typically presents as bilateral symmetrical breast enlargement with poorly defined borders. Unlike breast cancer, there is usually no evidence of fixation to the underlying chest wall and is not associated with skin changes or axillary lymphadenopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-causes-of-gynecomastia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and causes of gynecomastia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pseudogynecomastia &ndash; In contrast to gynecomastia, pseudogynecomastia represents an increase in breast fat rather than glandular tissue, which can generally be appreciated on clinical exam. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-gynecomastia-in-adults#H6317470\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and evaluation of gynecomastia in adults&quot;, section on 'Pseudogynecomastia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections &ndash; This includes breast abscess or other skin infections involving the chest wall. Typically, it presents as a localized and painful inflammation, often associated with systemic symptoms (eg, fever and malaise). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-breast-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary breast abscess&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lipoma &ndash; These are ovoid shaped breast masses comprised of fat. Lipomas are the most common benign soft-tissue neoplasm and rarely cause symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-benign-lesions-of-the-skin#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of benign lesions of the skin&quot;, section on 'Lipoma'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia &ndash; Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH) is characterized as a benign stromal proliferation. It presents as either a mass or thickening, and on imaging is characterized as a solid, well-defined, noncalcified mass. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-benign-breast-disease#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of benign breast disease&quot;, section on 'Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Granular cell tumor &ndash; Granular cell tumors are usually benign submucosal tumors that arise from Schwann cells. They most commonly occur in the oropharynx, skin, subcutaneous tissue, or breasts. The clinical presentation and imaging evaluation of these tumors can mirror invasive breast cancer. Therefore, diagnosis often requires tissue analysis, which is obtained at core needle biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-lesions-of-the-esophagus#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign lesions of the esophagus&quot;, section on 'Granular cell tumors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibromatosis &ndash; Fibromatoses (or desmoid tumors) are locally aggressive tumors with no known potential for metastasis or de-differentiation. The diagnosis requires histologic examination of a biopsy specimen.

A biopsy is necessary to rule out a primary versus metastatic lesion.</p><p/><p>Other rare tumors that occur in men include schwannoma, myofibroblastoma, and hemangiomas. In addition, other benign breast lesions that are more commonly seen in women should be considered. These are discussed in more detail separately.

In one study, the reported sensitivity and specificity rates of mammography were 92 and 90 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Radiographic features suggestive of malignancy include eccentricity to the nipple, spiculated margins, and microcalcifications. In contrast, gynecomastia typically appears as a round or triangular area of increased density positioned symmetrically in the retroareolar region. In rare cases, concurrent gynecomastia can mask a malignant lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast imaging for cancer screening: Mammography and ultrasonography&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any suspicious mass requires biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and to assay for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) content as well as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. Although fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology can provide adequate diagnostic material in many cases, avoiding open or surgical biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>], up to one-fourth of samples are insufficient for diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Compared with FNA, core needle biopsy offers a more definitive histologic diagnosis, avoids inadequate samples, and usually distinguishes between invasive versus in situ cancer. If inadequate tissue is obtained, an open biopsy should be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging work-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic evaluation and staging system used for breast cancers in men are the same as for women with breast cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of newly diagnosed breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Breast cancer is classified according to a Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system developed and maintained by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

The data to support less extensive chest wall resection (originally as a modified radical mastectomy rather than radical mastectomy) come from retrospective studies that consistently show the procedures result in an equivalent local recurrence rate and survival outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/10,63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,63-65</a>]. Additional support for simple mastectomy can also be drawn from studies in women that also demonstrated therapeutic equivalence of these two surgical procedures. Nipple- and skin-sparing mastectomy techniques have emerged as valuable tools in female breast cancer, but these have not been explored in male breast cancer, likely due to the constraints of tumor location and nipple involvement. However, the psychosocial distress described below suggests that greater attention to the cosmetic outcomes for men should not be ignored. Indeed, breast reconstruction has been performed in men seemingly for exactly this indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mastectomy-indications-types-and-concurrent-axillary-lymph-node-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mastectomy: Indications, types, and concurrent axillary lymph node management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, for men who want to avoid mastectomy, limited data suggest that breast-conserving surgery is a reasonable alternative, provided there is enough breast tissue to ensure that adequate surgical margins can be obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Although most men have a small volume of breast tissue, some men who develop breast cancer have sufficient breast tissue to permit breast conservation. In a review of data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER), 1541 cases of male breast cancer were identified, and almost 20 percent were treated with breast conservation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. While this study did not report outcomes, at least one retrospective study of seven men treated with breast-conserving therapy followed for a median of 67 months reported that none experienced a recurrence of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-conserving-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast conserving therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For men who opt to proceed with breast-conserving surgery, adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) is essential. This is based on consistent results showing that adjuvant RT after breast-conserving surgery for women confers a survival advantage.

Although the role of SLN biopsy is established in women with clinically node-negative breast cancer, its proven role in men is less robust due to the rarity of male breast cancer. Although large studies establishing the sensitivity and specificity of SLN biopsy in men with clinically node-negative breast cancer have not been carried out, smaller reports suggest it is feasible and accurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. As reported in a 2007 review of the literature, the detection rate was 100 percent in all studies, with no false-negatives identified when an axillary node dissection was performed.

Men tend to present at an older age than women. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common clinical presentation is a painless, firm, subareolar mass. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mammography is abnormal in 80 to 90 percent of men ultimately diagnosed with breast cancer. It can usually differentiate breast cancer from gynecomastia. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis and assay for hormone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, both of which may influence the selection of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation and staging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The staging work-up and Tumor, Nodes, Metastasis (TNM) staging system for breast cancer in men is identical to that used for female breast cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of newly diagnosed breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any man with a diagnosis of breast cancer should be referred for genetic counseling and BRCA testing. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most men with early-stage breast cancer, we suggest a simple mastectomy rather than breast-conserving surgery. (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, for men who are candidates for breast conservation, this would be a reasonable alternative approach. For men who pursue breast-conserving surgery, we recommend adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H188445062\" class=\"local\">'Early-stage disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For men with locally advanced breast cancer, we suggest neoadjuvant chemotherapy rather than primary surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H188445331\" class=\"local\">'Locally advanced disease'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As in women, surgical evaluation of the axillary lymph nodes is required. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Management of the regional nodes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a clinically uninvolved axilla, we suggest a sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy instead of full axillary node dissection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For men with a clinically positive axilla and patients with macroscopic evidence of disease in sentinel nodes on pathologic analysis, we recommend a complete axillary node dissection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For men who undergo a sentinel node biopsy and have microscopically positive sentinel nodes, the approach mirrors that for women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As in women, for men with locally advanced breast cancer (ie, T3 or T4 disease) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> four or more involved axillary nodes, we recommend postoperative chest wall and regional lymph node irradiation following surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Men with one to three positive lymph nodes should meet with a radiation oncologist to discuss the risks and benefits of radiation therapy. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant radiation therapy for women with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to adjuvant systemic therapy (ie, chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> HER2-directed therapy) for men with newly diagnosed breast cancer mirrors that for women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-her2-negative-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-systemic-therapy-for-her2-positive-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant systemic therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For men with newly diagnosed hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, we recommend adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> rather than observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In addition, we suggest tamoxifen rather than an aromatase inhibitor (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H954223\" class=\"local\">'Endocrine therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All male patients should be followed longitudinally following treatment for breast cancer. Although there are no established follow-up guidelines, extrapolation from the follow-up of women is reasonable. However, the role of mammography as part of surveillance in men is not clear. (See <a href=\"#H188447093\" class=\"local\">'Post-treatment surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to men with metastatic or advanced breast cancer is similar to that for women with metastatic breast cancer. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Approach to advanced or metastatic disease'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-in-men/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Siegel RL, Miller KD, Jemal A.
