The fall in serum tonicity in patients with hypotonic hyponatremia promotes water movement into the brain and, if the hyponatremia is acute and severe, can lead to cerebral edema and neurologic symptoms. In response to hyponatremia, the brain makes adaptations that lower the cerebral volume toward normal and reduce the likelihood of these complications. The mechanisms responsible for this cerebral adaptation are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Brain adaptation to hyponatremia'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations of hyponatremia and hypernatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Osmolytes and cerebral adaptation to hyponatremia'</a>.)</p><p>However, brain adaptations that reduce the risk of cerebral edema make the brain vulnerable to injury if chronic hyponatremia is too rapidly corrected. The neurologic manifestations associated with overly rapid correction have been called the osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS, formerly called central pontine myelinolysis or CPM). As will be described below, almost all patients who develop ODS present with a serum sodium concentration of 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> or less.</p><p>Issues related to ODS and the approach to the patient with unintentional overly rapid correction of hyponatremia will be reviewed here. A general overview of the treatment of hyponatremia is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of hyponatremia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BRAIN ADAPTATION TO HYPONATREMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A decrease in serum tonicity causes water to flow across the blood-brain barrier, increasing brain water content. The decrease in serum tonicity also causes brain cells, primarily astrocytes, to swell. Astrocytes are cells that surround brain capillaries and express water channels on their foot processes; these cells protect neurons from swelling via a cell-to-cell transfer of cellular solutes and water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The brain begins to adapt to hypotonicity almost immediately after a fall in serum sodium, and the adaptation is complete within two days. If the brain were unable to adapt, even mild hyponatremia would result in life-threatening cerebral edema. However, within minutes after a fall in serum sodium, increased intracranial pressure forces interstitial sodium and water out of the brain into the cerebrospinal fluid, ameliorating the increased brain volume. In addition, astrocytes begin to lose intracellular solutes, principally potassium and organic solutes (called osmolytes), within hours of a fall in serum sodium and serum tonicity. This process permits these cells to shed excess water and to have the same tonicity as plasma without a large increase in cell water (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F71152\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71152 \">figure 1</a>). Cerebral adaptation to hyponatremia is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations of hyponatremia and hypernatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Osmolytes and cerebral adaptation to hyponatremia'</a>.)</p><p>Because the brain is able to adapt to hypotonicity, hyponatremia that develops over more than two to three days is not associated with severe brain swelling; it is therefore much less likely to be complicated by seizures and coma, and is extremely unlikely to produce brain herniation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, once the brain has adapted to hypotonicity, the rate of correction of the hyponatremia becomes important. Overly rapid correction of severe hyponatremia can lead to the osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). By contrast, rapid correction is <strong>not</strong> likely to induce ODS in patients with severe hyponatremia that has only been present for several hours, since the cerebral adaptation is at an early stage. Examples include water intoxication in marathon runners, psychotic patients, and users of ecstasy; rapid correction does not usually lead to ODS in these patients.</p><p>Demyelination of the central pons (CPM) is one manifestation of ODS. However, brain demyelination that is associated with rapid correction of hyponatremia may be more diffuse, and it does not always involve the pons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3746972746\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS OF ODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>How the osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) occurs is not completely understood. Chronic hyponatremia is associated with the loss of osmotically active organic osmolytes (such as myoinositol, glutamate, and glutamine) from astrocytes, which provide protection against brain cell swelling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations of hyponatremia and hypernatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Osmolytes and cerebral adaptation to hyponatremia'</a>.)</p><p>However, organic osmolytes cannot be as quickly replaced when the brain volume begins to shrink in response to correction of the hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. As a result, brain volume can fall from a value that is initially somewhat above normal to one below normal with rapid correction of hyponatremia. Studies in rats have shown that demyelination primarily occurs in areas of the brain that are slowest in reaccumulating osmolytes after rapid correction of hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The mechanism by which a rapid fall in brain volume results in demyelination has not been established. One possible mechanism is that osmotic shrinkage of endothelial cells opens the blood-brain barrier, allowing the entry of complement and other cytotoxic plasma components. Another proposed mechanism is that, during recovery from hyponatremia, the loss of cell water coupled with the movement of potassium and sodium back into the cells lead to an initial increase in cell cation concentration that occurs before the repletion of organic osmolytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/7,8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,11</a>]. These combined changes may directly injure and induce apoptosis of astrocytes, leading to a disruption in the function of myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, release of inflammatory cytokines, and activation of microglia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR ODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) primarily occurs with overly rapid correction of severe hyponatremia (serum sodium concentration almost always 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> or less) that has been present for more than two to three days, which is the time required for the cerebral adaptation to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/3,4,6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,6,13</a>]. However, some patients are particularly susceptible to this complication and can develop ODS with less severe hyponatremia (ie, with initial serum sodium concentrations above 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L)</span> and slower rates of correction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1957198\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum sodium at presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of ODS cases occur in patients whose sodium concentrations at presentation are &le;105 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L,</span> and the vast majority of reported cases arise in patients who present with a serum sodium of 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/3,4,6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,6,13</a>].

Their sodium level may then increase quite rapidly as a result of a water diuresis. </p><p/><p>In one study of patients with serum sodium concentrations that were &le;105 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L,</span> correction by &gt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in 24 hours or &gt;18 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in 48 hours was associated with post-therapeutic neurologic complications; over one-half of the chronically hyponatremic patients who were corrected this rapidly developed complications, while all patients who were corrected more slowly had uneventful recoveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Another study identified only four cases of ODS among 37 patients with a serum sodium that was &le;120 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> who were corrected by &gt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> and no cases of ODS among 218 patients who were more slowly corrected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, all cases with ODS in this series had an initial serum sodium of &le;105 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span>.</p><p>The likely reason for these observations is the fact that patients who have more severe hyponatremia at presentation tend to experience a larger increase in the serum sodium concentration during treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Cerebral adaptation in patients with very severe hyponatremia (eg, &lt;105 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L)</span> requires greater depletion of brain organic osmolytes, and therefore, these patients are also more likely to develop ODS after rapid correction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9515951\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of hyponatremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies in experimental animals showed that brain damage does not occur when hyponatremia of less than one day's duration is rapidly corrected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. However, if hyponatremia persists for two to three days or more, the same treatment results in usually fatal demyelinating brain lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/17-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-27</a>].</p><p>Similar findings have been noted in humans. Neurologic deterioration following rapid correction of hyponatremia is unlikely in patients with severe hyponatremia that develops over a few hours, particularly in those whose normal water excretory capacity rapidly and spontaneously returns the serum sodium to normal. Examples include the ingestion of large amounts of water over several hours by marathon runners, psychotic patients, and users of ecstasy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/3,4,13,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,13,28</a>]. In these patients, hyponatremia develops rapidly, and the brain does not have time to fully adapt. By contrast, patients who develop hyponatremia more gradually have time for the brain adaptation and may develop the ODS after rates of correction that are well tolerated in patients with self-induced acute water intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/2-6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Brain adaptation to hyponatremia'</a> above.)</p><p>Although the duration of hyponatremia is a major determinant of susceptibility to ODS, it is often not known. Thus, clinicians should assume that the patient has chronic hyponatremia unless the history suggests acute water intoxication.</p><p>Polydipsia does not always convey resistance to osmotic demyelination, since some polydipsic patients have hyponatremia of sufficient duration to permit cerebral adaptation. As an example, ODS has been reported in malnourished alcoholic patients with polydipsia and chronic hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In addition, alcoholism and malnutrition are risk factors for osmotic demyelination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyponatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Primary polydipsia'</a> and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Other'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Overly rapid rate of correction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies in experimental animals have shown that osmotic demyelination is caused by correction of hyponatremia and not by hyponatremia itself, and that more rapid rates of correction increase the likelihood and severity of brain lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The threshold rate of correction, above which brain lesions may develop, is approximately 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> per day in dogs and 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in rats; the incidence of lesions progressively increases with larger magnitudes of daily correction, and the majority of animals will be affected if the correction rate exceeds 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. The effect of the hourly rate of correction is influenced by the daily rate of correction. Specifically, a more rapid hourly rate of correction is associated with more severe lesions only if the daily rate threshold is exceeded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/30,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32</a>]. By contrast, if the daily rate of correction remains lower than the threshold for inducing osmotic demyelination, then even extremely rapid hourly rates (as much as 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> per hour) can be well tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Observational studies in humans are consistent with experimental studies in animals, showing that more rapid rates of correction of chronic hyponatremia are associated with osmotic demyelination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/3,4,15,29,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,15,29,33-35</a>]. Most of these studies report the total increase in the serum sodium concentration over a 24- or 48-hour period and not the hourly rate of correction expressed in <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> per hour. Thus, our recommendations on the rate of correction of hyponatremia are based upon the daily, rather than the hourly, rate of correction.</p><p>It is difficult to define a threshold rate of correction below which ODS will not occur. Occasional cases have been reported in which ODS has developed after correction by as little as 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> per day or 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>], and a large cohort study has shown that correction by less than 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> per day was not associated with neurologic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Thus, because there is no proven advantage to correcting hyponatremia by more than 4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> per day, we and other authors recommend that the rate of correction of hyponatremia should not exceed 6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in any 24-hour period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. This is not a goal of therapy, but rather a therapeutic limit that should not be exceeded. In the past, it was thought that the serum sodium concentration should be increased to a supposedly &quot;safe&quot; level of 120 to 128 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span>. There is no evidence to support this practice, and doing so could result in marked overcorrection of hyponatremia in patients with very low serum sodium concentrations. We recommend a correction goal of 4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> per day, no matter how low the initial serum sodium concentration is.

The reasons why ODS is uncommon in patients treated with hemodialysis are not completely understood; however, one mechanism may be that the rise in serum osmolality induced by the rise in serum sodium during dialysis may be counterbalanced by a fall in serum osmolality induced by the removal of urea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/22,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,50</a>]. Urea crosses the blood-brain barrier relatively slowly compared with osmotic water movement and therefore acts as an effective osmole when serum levels are rapidly reduced. Another possible mechanism is that azotemia enhances brain reuptake of organic osmolytes during correction of hyponatremia, minimizing cellular shrinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several other factors appear to increase the susceptibility to osmotic demyelination.

There are no data on the use of either glucocorticoids or myoinositol in humans with overly rapid correction of hyponatremia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H708001238\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of established ODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have developed osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) as a consequence of hyponatremia correction typically require intensive supportive therapy. In addition, such patients should have their serum sodium relowered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44162660\"><span class=\"h3\">Relowering the serum sodium to treat ODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal approach to the treatment of patients with serum sodium values that have corrected too rapidly and who have developed neurologic manifestations consistent with ODS is unclear. Based upon the ensuing observations of benefit, the absence of other effective therapies, and the poor prognosis associated with ODS, we recommend relowering the serum sodium to a level that is <strong>just below</strong> the maximal 48-hour target value (ie, to a value that is less than 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> above the initial serum sodium). The 48-hour goal was chosen because patients with ODS typically present two to six days after overly rapid correction. The efficacy and safety of this approach is unknown.</p><p>The regimens used to relower the serum sodium in patients with ODS are the same as those described below to relower the serum sodium in patients who have exceeded correction limits (but who have not yet developed manifestations of ODS). (See <a href=\"#H2638908677\" class=\"local\">'Patients who have exceeded correction limits (rescue strategy)'</a> above.)</p><p>The potential efficacy of relowering the serum sodium after the onset of neurologic symptoms of ODS was demonstrated in a rat model in which severe hyponatremia of three days' duration was rapidly corrected with hypertonic saline by 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> at 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the control rats, only 1 of 13 was still alive at 10 days (mean survival time of 3.3 days).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The outcomes were much better among rats treated with relowering the serum sodium with distilled water to a total correction of less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> at 24 hours; seven survived, and the mean survival time was 7.5 days. The rats that were treated four hours after symptom onset had better outcomes than those that were treated 8 to 10 hours after symptom onset.</p><p/><p>Data in humans are limited to case reports that suggest benefit from early relowering of the serum sodium in patients who have developed symptoms of ODS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-61</a>]. As an example, a 71-year-old woman developed symptomatic hyponatremia with a serum sodium of 106 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in association with thiazide diuretic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The administration of isotonic saline was associated with an elevation in serum sodium of 21 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in the first 24 hours. After initial neurologic improvement, the patient deteriorated after 72 hours. The administration of hypotonic fluid and dDAVP relowered the serum sodium so that the final elevation was only 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span>. The patient recovered without neurologic sequelae.</p><p>A similar outcome was described in another case report in which the serum sodium was raised by 23 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in the first 48 hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F76131\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76131 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Relowering the serum sodium from 132 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> within the first 12 hours after the onset of neurologic manifestations consistent with ODS was associated with full neurologic recovery over the ensuing 36 hours.</p><p>In the few case reports previously described, relowering with dDAVP and D5W was initiated within hours of the onset of neurologic symptoms, and there were substantial reductions in serum sodium (up to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L)</span> within the first 12 hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F76131\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76131 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. The optimal target serum sodium and rate of relowering in patients with ODS have not been defined. A reasonable approach is to lower the serum sodium to a value that is less than 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> above the lowest level when therapy was initiated. As an example, a patient who presented with a serum sodium of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> and who develops symptoms of ODS with a serum sodium of 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> should have his or her sodium level lowered to approximately 115 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> (ie, an increase just below 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L,</span> which is the 48-hour limit). The rate of relowering should be approximately 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> per hour, and the patient's neurologic status and serum sodium should be carefully monitored as relowering is performed.</p><p>Relowering therapy should be initiated as quickly as possible after the onset of neurologic symptoms that are attributed to ODS. In the rat model described above, initiation of relowering within four hours of symptom onset was associated with better outcomes than initiation within 8 to 10 hours of symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In the case reports in humans, relowering was initiated within a few hours after the onset of neurologic symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F76131\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76131 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. There is no evidence of benefit in humans when relowering is begun more than 24 hours after the onset of ODS symptoms, but clinicians may choose a trial of relowering in this setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44162667\"><span class=\"h3\">Supportive therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with ODS recover function after prolonged periods of severe neurologic impairment. Thus, aggressive supportive therapy should be provided to all patients who were functional prior to the onset of ODS. Since patients with severe ODS frequently develop aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure, endotracheal intubation and ventilator support are often required. Recovery from seemingly hopeless neurologic deficits can occur, and therefore, supportive therapy should be continued for at least six to eight weeks before concluding that the deficits are irreversible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/6,75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,75,76</a>]. As an example, in a study of 36 patients with ODS treated in a critical care unit (32 of whom required mechanical ventilation), 69 percent survived, and 56 percent of the survivors were left with only minimal neurologic sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].

A case report of three hyponatremic patients described aggressive plasmapheresis that started immediately after the diagnosis of ODS was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].

The neurologic manifestations of this injury have been called the osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS, formerly called central pontine myelinolysis or CPM). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The brain begins to adapt to hypotonicity almost immediately after a fall in serum sodium, and the adaptation is complete within two days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F71152\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71152 \">figure 1</a>). Because the brain is able to adapt to hypotonicity, hyponatremia that develops over more than two to three days is not associated with severe brain swelling and is therefore much less likely to be complicated by seizures and coma; it is also extremely unlikely to produce brain herniation. However, once the brain has adapted to hypotonicity, the rate of correction of the hyponatremia becomes important. Overly rapid correction of severe hyponatremia can lead to ODS. By contrast, rapid correction is <strong>not</strong> likely to induce ODS in patients with severe hyponatremia that has only been present for several hours, since the cerebral adaptation is at an early stage. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Brain adaptation to hyponatremia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major risk factors for ODS include the following (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for ODS'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serum sodium at presentation &ndash; The majority of ODS cases occur in patients whose sodium concentrations at presentation are &le;105 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L,</span> and the vast majority of reported cases arise in patients who present with a serum sodium of 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> or less. When the initial serum sodium is greater than 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L,</span> ODS is rare and typically limited to patients with severe liver disease and patients with diabetes insipidus who have developed hyponatremia as a complication of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> (dDAVP) therapy and then have the dDAVP discontinued. (See <a href=\"#H1957198\" class=\"local\">'Serum sodium at presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Duration of hyponatremia &ndash; Neurologic deterioration following rapid correction of hyponatremia is unlikely in patients with severe hyponatremia that develops over a few hours. By contrast, patients who develop hyponatremia more gradually have time for the brain adaptation and may develop the ODS after overly rapid correction. The duration of hyponatremia is often not known. Thus, clinicians should assume that the patient has chronic hyponatremia unless the history suggests acute water intoxication. (See <a href=\"#H9515951\" class=\"local\">'Duration of hyponatremia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Overly rapid rate of correction &ndash; It is difficult to define a threshold rate of correction below which ODS will not occur. Occasional cases have been reported in which ODS has developed after correction by as little as 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> per day or 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in 48 hours. We and other authors recommend that the rate of correction of hyponatremia should not exceed 6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in any 24-hour period. This is not a goal of therapy, but rather a therapeutic limit that should not be exceeded. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Overly rapid rate of correction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of ODS are typically <strong>delayed</strong> for two to six days after overly rapid elevation of the serum sodium concentration has occurred (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F76131\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76131 \">figure 2</a>). The symptoms, which are often irreversible or only partially reversible, include dysarthria, dysphagia, paraparesis or quadriparesis, behavioral disturbances, movement disorders, seizures, lethargy, confusion, disorientation, obtundation, and coma. Severely affected patients may become &quot;locked in&quot;; they are awake but are unable to move or verbally communicate. Other common findings include increased muscle tone and facial weakness, as well as snout, grasp, or rooting reflexes. (See <a href=\"#H3110154200\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ODS should be suspected in all patients who have risk factors for the disorder and consistent clinical manifestations. ODS is likely to be present if overly rapid correction of hyponatremia has occurred during the previous week. Patients suspected of having ODS should undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or, if MRI is unavailable, computerized tomography (CT) scanning of the brain. (See <a href=\"#H3295564\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with hyponatremia lasting more than two to three days, or with hyponatremia of unknown duration, we recommend that the serum sodium be raised by less than 6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in any 24-hour period to prevent ODS (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). When correcting the serum sodium in patients with hyponatremia, careful monitoring of the serum sodium concentration (initially, every two to three hours) is essential to avoid overly rapid correction in patients at increased risk for ODS. The urine volume should also be monitored for the emergence of a water diuresis. (See <a href=\"#H3521266250\" class=\"local\">'Prevention in patients at risk for ODS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients, during the course of treatment of hyponatremia, require further therapy to prevent overly rapid correction or to relower the serum sodium if overly rapid correction occurs. Such patients, and the corresponding therapeutic strategies, include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Proactive strategy&quot; in patients who are likely to develop overly rapid correction &ndash; If the cause of impaired water excretion is likely to be reversible (eg, in hypovolemic patients), a water diuresis may develop and cause an abrupt rise in the serum sodium. In these patients, or in patients at high risk for developing ODS (eg, patients with alcoholic liver disease), urinary water losses and rapid correction of hyponatremia can be prevented by administering dDAVP at the outset of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H2188016127\" class=\"local\">'Patients likely to have overly rapid correction (proactive strategy)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Reactive strategy&quot; in patients with a worrisome trajectory of the serum sodium &ndash; If a water diuresis emerges during therapy, or if the initial trajectory of correction appears likely to exceed maximum recommended goals, urinary free water losses can either be replaced with 5 percent dextrose in water (D5W) or stopped with the administration of dDAVP. (See <a href=\"#H3971230250\" class=\"local\">'Patients with a worrisome serum sodium trajectory (reactive strategy)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Rescue strategy&quot; in patients who have already exceeded the correction limits &ndash; If the rate of correction has already exceeded recommended limits, further water losses are stopped with the administration of dDAVP, and the serum sodium concentration is relowered. (See <a href=\"#H2638908677\" class=\"local\">'Patients who have exceeded correction limits (rescue strategy)'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have developed ODS as a consequence of hyponatremia correction typically require intensive supportive therapy. In addition, such patients should have their serum sodium relowered.
