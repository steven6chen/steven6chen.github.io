This RNA virus was initially considered of minor public health importance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It emerged from obscurity in 1999 when the first incursion of the virus into North America caused 62 cases of encephalitis and seven deaths in New York [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Since that time, the virus has dramatically spread, and WN virus activity has now been detected in all 48 continental states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. WN virus causes both sporadic infection and outbreaks that may be associated with severe neurologic disease.</p><p>The epidemiology and pathogenesis of West Nile virus will be addressed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of infection are discussed elsewhere.

The virus had not been detected in the Americas before the 1999 New York City outbreak. It is unknown how WN virus got to the United States. While initial phylogenetic studies suggested a Middle Eastern origin for the North American WN virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], subsequent analysis indicated that WN strains now circulating in Europe and Israel originated from the same independent location, probably North Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. WN virus is now considered endemic in North America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Patterns of illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the first discovery of WN virus, infrequent human outbreaks were mostly reported in groups of soldiers, children, and healthy adults in Israel and Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. These outbreaks were associated with only minor illness in the majority of patients; some case fatalities were associated with increasing age. In one of the largest outbreaks reported, thousands of self-limited and relatively mild clinical cases, consisting of fever, rash, and polyarthralgias occurred in South Africa, resulting in an epidemic attack rate of 55 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>However, since the mid-1990s, outbreaks of WN virus infection associated with severe neurologic disease began to occur in North Africa (Algeria [1994, 1997], Tunisia [1997], Sudan [2002]); Europe (Romania [1996]); Russia (1999); Israel (2000); North America (United States [1999], Canada [2002]); and India (2011) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/4,14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14-19</a>]. In each of these outbreaks, the mortality among patients with meningitis and encephalitis was approximately 10 percent, and occurred more often in elderly patients. Since 2002, outbreaks have also occurred in multiple southern European countries, with annual epidemic cycles in some countries related to the spread of WN virus lineage 2 strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence in the United States</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since 2000, the ArboNET national surveillance system has tracked WN virus in the United States, and WN virus is the leading cause of domestically acquired arboviral disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Most studies indicate that increased WN virus incidence is related to above-average temperatures, with variable impact of precipitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. </p><p>West Nile fever cases are considerably underreported since most infected persons are asymptomatic, do not seek medical care for mild symptoms, or are not tested for WN virus. Thus, the most accurate trend data derive from monitoring cases of invasive neurologic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The incidence of neuroinvasive disease varies considerably across the United States (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F90997\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90997 \">figure 1</a>). Updated reports are available on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/index.html&amp;token=R4Uiw8/bmPVaqNHRDqpXLEoyJA7FYK2lK6iGYL+tKnvUP95HNSq7yBXOFowdnyJ8&amp;TOPIC_ID=1304\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a>.</p><p>From 1999 to 2015, a total of 43,937 confirmed and probable cases of WN virus disease, including 20,265 cases of neuroinvasive disease, were reported to the CDC from 48 states and the District of Columbia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Only 19 human cases of WN neuroinvasive disease were reported in the United States in 2000 and 64 in 2001. However, from 2002 to 2014, the number of reported neuroinvasive disease cases ranged from 386 to 2946; the three largest outbreaks occurred in 2002 (2946 cases), 2003 (2866 cases), and 2012 (2873 cases). </p><p>The large multistate outbreak in 2012 was widespread, with 43 states reporting a higher incidence of neuroinvasive disease in 2012 compared with the median for 2004-2011; more than half of these cases were reported from four states and 29 percent were reported from Texas alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The incidence rate of WN neuroinvasive disease in Dallas county was 7.30 per 100,000 residents in 2012, which was significantly higher than the largest previous Dallas County outbreak of 2.91 per 100,000 in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>However, serologic surveys and extrapolations from blood donor screening data indicate that neuroinvasive disease following infection is infrequent, with estimates ranging from 1 in 140 to 1 in 256 infections resulting in meningitis or encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/14,29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,29-32</a>]. By extrapolation, the 20,265 cases of invasive neurologic disease reported in the United States through 2015 would imply that from 2.8 to 5.2 million persons have been infected. Serological surveys indicate that even in areas experiencing outbreaks, less than 10 percent of the population is infected with WN virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/14,29,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,29,32,33</a>].</p><p>Human illnesses usually peak in late summer or early fall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F90996\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90996 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As an example, cases peaked in late August during the 2012 outbreak in Dallas county, with 92 percent having illness onset during July through September [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The seasonal variation is because mosquitoes emerge in the spring in temperate climates, which begins viral amplification in the bird-mosquito-bird cycle. Viral amplification peaks in early fall; the risk of infection then decreases in humans when female mosquitoes begin diapause and infrequently bite. However, sporadic cases can occur throughout the year in southern states. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence in Canada</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epidemiology and ecology of WN virus in Canada reflects that of the northern United States. The virus is now endemic in all Canadian provinces. Through 2016, a total of 1116 patients with neuroinvasive disease have been reported in Canada. The first human cases were reported in 2002, with 414 illnesses and deaths reported from Quebec and Ontario. In 2003, 1481 cases were reported, of whom 217 had neuroinvasive disease and 10 died. From 2004 to 2006, fewer than 50 cases of neuroinvasive disease were reported each year, only to be followed by a large outbreak in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba in 2007 with 2338 cases reported, including 130 cases with neuroinvasive disease. From 2008 to 2016, the number of reported cases has ranged from 5 to 428 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence in Latin America and the Caribbean</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>WN virus was first detected south of the United States border in 2001, when a resident of the Cayman Islands developed WN virus encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. By 2003, the virus was detected in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Belize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]; by 2004 in Colombia and Venezuela [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>] and by 2005 in Argentina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>However, isolation of virus has been infrequent and documented avian, equine, and human morbidity are scant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].

Birds are the primary amplifying hosts, and the virus is maintained in a bird-mosquito-bird cycle. Humans, horses, and many other vertebrates serve as incidental hosts and are not felt to be important for transmission since viremia is both short-lived and low-grade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p>Rarely, transmission can also occur from mother to child in utero, or from an infected donor to a blood or organ transplant recipient. Transmission has also been documented via breast milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], occupational percutaneous exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], conjunctival exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], and by unidentified means in a dialysis center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1117177544\"><span class=\"h3\">Mosquitoes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mosquitos that transmit WN virus are usually of the <em>Culex</em> species, which vary by geographic area. The major mosquito vectors in Africa and the Middle East are <em>Culex univittatus</em> and <em>Culex pipiens molestus</em>, and in Asia, <em>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</em>. WN virus has been recovered from ticks in Russia, but it is not clear what role they play in maintaining or disseminating the virus.</p><p>Surveillance has identified 66 mosquito species infected with the WN virus in North America. WN and the St. Louis encephalitis viruses appear to share the same maintenance vectors (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=st-louis-encephalitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;St. Louis encephalitis&quot;</a>). <em>Culex pipiens pipiens</em> (northern house mosquito) is an important maintenance vector in the northern United States and Canada, <em>Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus</em> (southern house mosquito) is important in the southern United States, and <em>Culex tarsalis</em> is important in the western United States and Canada. The relative proportion of human infections caused by each mosquito species is difficult to discern, but likely varies geographically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Birds as amplifying hosts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous passerine birds develop prolonged high levels of viremia and serve as amplifying hosts. Although the birds generally remain asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>], significant avian mortality has been noted in Israel, the United States, and Canada, where similar strains of the virus have circulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/9,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,55</a>]. High mortality has been noted among American crows and other North American corvids (ravens, jays, and other crows) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Populations of some bird species have shown no signs of recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Single nucleotide changes in the NS1-2B and NS3 genes appear responsible for the increased mortality in American crows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/53,58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,58,59</a>].</p><p>A higher incidence of WN infection has been noted to occur in residents who live in high crow-mortality areas compared with those who reside outside of these areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. As an example, in New York State, the risk of developing WN virus was associated with living in towns proximal to dead crow clusters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The risk of developing infection was highest if the cluster of dead birds occurred within the current or prior 1 to 2 weeks. However, decreasing susceptible bird populations and waning interest in avian mortality surveillance have decreased the value of dead crow sightings as an indicator of virus activity. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1117177487\"><span class=\"h3\">Donated blood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transmission has been described via transfused blood, red blood cells, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. However, universal screening of the United States and Canadian blood supplies has nearly eliminated the risk of transfusion-transmitted WN virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/47,63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,63,64</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of West Nile virus infection&quot;, section on 'Intravenous immunoglobulin'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Cell intrinsic innate immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Innate antiviral defenses are also critical for control of WN virus, as demonstrated in mouse models and evidenced by extreme susceptibility to infection in persons with certain immunocompromising conditions. These innate defenses include the production of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines, the expression of antiviral genes, and the subsequent activation of the adaptive immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/77,79,84-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,79,84-88</a>]. WN virus infection is sensed by pattern-recognition receptors, including retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 protein (RIG-1)-like receptors and Toll-like receptors, which recognize distinct viral signatures known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns. These receptors subsequently trigger downstream signaling pathways that activate the innate immune defenses, including the production of <span class=\"nowrap\">interferons-alpha/beta</span>. <span class=\"nowrap\">Interferons-alpha/beta</span> subsequently stimulate genes that inhibit viral replication, modulate the adaptive immune response, and possibly tighten the blood-brain barrier to limit neuroinvasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Complement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The complement system is a large family of proteins that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns, altered cell surface ligands, and immune complexes. Complement suppresses WN viral infection by inducing several antiviral effector functions of the immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>], and has been demonstrated to prevent lethal WN infection in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>However, WN virus may evade complement-mediated control via its nonstructural protein (NS)-1. NS-1 binds and recruits the complement regulatory protein factor H, which may lower the ability of the immune system to target WN virus by decreasing complement-mediated recognition of infected cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a study of 23 patients who died from WN encephalomyelitis, glial nodules with variable loss of neurons, and perivascular cuffing by mononuclear cells was observed in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].
