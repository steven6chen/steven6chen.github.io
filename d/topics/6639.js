This anomaly can occur as part of a syndrome involving multiple other organs or as an isolated malformation. Most studies suggest that about 70 percent of cases of <span class=\"nowrap\">CL/P</span> and 50 percent of CP are nonsyndromic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-prenatal-diagnosis-obstetrical-management-and-recurrence-of-cleft-lip-and-or-palate/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although both congenital anomalies result in malformation of the midface, <span class=\"nowrap\">CL/P</span> and CP differ with respect to embryology, etiology, candidate genes, associated abnormalities, and recurrence risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported prevalence of orofacial clefts varies by country, method of ascertainment, and classification. In the United States, the National Birth Defects Prevention Network for 2007 to 2011 reported the estimated prevalence of orofacial clefts (CL alone, CP alone, and CL with CP) was 14.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/10,000</span> live births (1 in 690 births): the prevalence of CL alone was 3.<span class=\"nowrap\">1/10,000</span> live births, the prevalence of CL with CP was 5.6 per 10,000 live births, and the prevalence of CP alone was 5.9 per 10,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-prenatal-diagnosis-obstetrical-management-and-recurrence-of-cleft-lip-and-or-palate/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, among newborns with a CL, approximately one-third had CL alone and two-thirds had CL with CP.</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Race/ethnicity</span> also affects the prevalence of orofacial clefts. Prevalence was lowest in American blacks (10.<span class=\"nowrap\">2/10,000</span> live births), highest in American Indian or Alaska Natives (20.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/10,000</span> live births), and at an intermediate level in other groups (whites, Hispanics, Asians, Pacific Islander) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-prenatal-diagnosis-obstetrical-management-and-recurrence-of-cleft-lip-and-or-palate/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The First Nations population of British Columbia, Canada, has the highest reported birth prevalence of orofacial clefts in the world, nearly <span class=\"nowrap\">30/10,000</span> births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-prenatal-diagnosis-obstetrical-management-and-recurrence-of-cleft-lip-and-or-palate/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>In contrast, the prevalence of isolated CP appears to be constant across races and ethnicities. CP has a different etiology than CL, and environmental and genetic factors (discussed below) likely affect risk of development of CL more than development of CP.</p><p>Sex also affects prevalence. The prevalence of CL alone and CL with CP is higher in males than females, but the prevalence of CP alone is higher in females than males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-prenatal-diagnosis-obstetrical-management-and-recurrence-of-cleft-lip-and-or-palate/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Prevalence increases modestly with maternal age &ge;35 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-prenatal-diagnosis-obstetrical-management-and-recurrence-of-cleft-lip-and-or-palate/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EMBRYOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Craniofacial development represents a complex interaction of cell patterning, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Much of facial tissue originates by cell migration from the embryonic neural crest. Underlying this development are regulatory, structural, and positional genes that govern the required cell-cell interactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cleft lip</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete closure of the lip is usually accomplished by 35 days postconception as the lateral nasal, median nasal, and maxillary mesodermal processes merge. Failure of closure of any one of the three normal sites of fusion can produce unilateral, bilateral, or (rarely) median lip clefting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78946\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78946 \">figure 1</a>). Lack of fusion of the facial elements can be mild, involving only the upper lip, or can extend into the palate or the midface, thereby affecting the nose, forehead, eyes, and brain.</p><p>CL can be unilateral or bilateral; unilateral CL on the left side is the most common presentation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cleft palate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isolated CP occurs when there is primary lack of fusion of the palatal shelves. Abnormalities in programmed cell death may contribute to lack of palatal fusion, although this mechanism remains debated. Isolated disruption of palate shelves can occur after closure of the lip because palatal closure is not completed until 56 to 58 days postconception.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The detection and study of fetal midfacial anomalies have led to important information regarding the candidate genes and environmental factors influencing fetal development. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The process of midface development involves genes which control cell patterning, cell proliferation, extracellular communication, and differentiation. Gene defects in each of these developmental processes crucial to midface development are associated with cleft malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-prenatal-diagnosis-obstetrical-management-and-recurrence-of-cleft-lip-and-or-palate/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Clefting usually represents a genetically complex event; single Mendelian disorders associated with clefting are less common. While at least one major gene may be operative in one-half of patients, in most cases, 2 to 20 genes are thought to interact to result in facial clefting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-prenatal-diagnosis-obstetrical-management-and-recurrence-of-cleft-lip-and-or-palate/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>There are several major categories of genetic defects:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proliferation defects, eg, sonic hedgehog gene</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extracellular matrix defects, eg, TGF-alpha variant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differentiation defects, eg, TGF-beta gene</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interferon regulatory factors, eg, IRF-6</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cell adhesion molecules</p><p/><p>Most of the above genes have been implicated in animal models as responsible for orofacial clefting; similar findings in humans are more limited.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Sonic hedgehog gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interactions between the ectoderm and the mesoderm are important in facial development. The secreted protein sonic Hedgehog (shh) mediates ectodermal functions, and mutations of this gene classically produce holoprosencephaly. Several lines of evidence support shh as an ectodermal signal that regulates the outgrowth and fusion of the facial domains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-prenatal-diagnosis-obstetrical-management-and-recurrence-of-cleft-lip-and-or-palate/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">TGF-alpha variants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha is a receptor ligand made in the epithelia.

Orientation and development of other facial structures can provide useful information for distinguishing unilateral, bilateral, and midline malformations. As an example, midline forebrain abnormalities (eg, holoprosencephaly) suggest malformation of midline facial structures may also be present. The majority of infants with CL also have palatal involvement: 85 percent of bilateral CL and 70 percent of unilateral CL are associated with CP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-prenatal-diagnosis-obstetrical-management-and-recurrence-of-cleft-lip-and-or-palate/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Live births, stillbirths, and abortuses are included if medical record review by a clinical geneticist ascertains eligibility criteria are met. Infants with chromosomal abnormalities and single gene disorders, as well as those with orofacial clefts secondary to another defect (eg, holoprosencephaly, amniotic band sequence), are excluded. For the years 1998 to 2004, prenatal diagnosis was made in 33.3 percent of the 978 cases of <span class=\"nowrap\">CL/P,</span> 20.3 percent of the 522 cases of CL only, and 0.3 percent of the 798 cases of CP only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-prenatal-diagnosis-obstetrical-management-and-recurrence-of-cleft-lip-and-or-palate/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The sensitivity of fetal ultrasound for detecting facial clefting was slightly higher when the orofacial cleft was associated with other unrelated structural anomalies (33.5 versus 28.2 percent with no other anomalies).</p><p>Higher sensitivities have been observed in research studies and studies that included orofacial clefts related to other defects (eg, syndrome associated with a chromosomal abnormality, holoprosencephaly).

The variation in rate of associated anomalies emphasizes the underlying differences in the development of <span class=\"nowrap\">CL/P</span> versus CP.

About 70 percent of cases of <span class=\"nowrap\">CL/P</span> and 50 percent of CP are nonsyndromic. Conversely, about 30 percent of cases of <span class=\"nowrap\">CL/P</span> and 50 percent of CP are syndromic and specialist genetic advice should be sought in these cases.

Women planning pregnancy can reduce their risk of having a child with an orofacial cleft by working with their doctor to discontinue drugs associated with this malformation. Advice on smoking cessation and not consuming alcoholic beverages should be given. Avoiding folate deficiency by diet or supplements may also be useful. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orofacial clefts are diagnosed beginning after 12 weeks of gestation when the soft tissues of the fetal face can be clearly visualized sonographically and developmental separation of the lip and palate should no longer be present. The sensitivity of fetal ultrasound for facial clefting is highest when <span class=\"nowrap\">CL/P</span> is associated with other structural anomalies. In other situations, such as isolated <span class=\"nowrap\">CL/P</span> in a low risk population, the sensitivity may only reach 50 percent. Isolated CP is the most difficult orofacial malformation to diagnose prenatally with a low detection rate of &lt;7 percent.
