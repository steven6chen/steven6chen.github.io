The majority of these patients have atrial fibrillation (AF) and CAD with or without prior stenting. In AF patients with CAD and no prior stenting, long-term treatment with an oral anticoagulant without antiplatelet therapy is recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-for-the-secondary-prevention-of-atherosclerotic-cardiovascular-disease#H4047693720\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin for the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease&quot;, section on 'Anticoagulated patients'</a>.) </p><p/><p>For all patients who have undergone coronary artery stenting (irrespective of the need for anticoagulant), intense antiplatelet therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and a P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker is required for some period of time to lower the risk of stent thrombosis. At some point, the P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker is stopped and aspirin is continued indefinitely. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-antiplatelet-therapy-after-coronary-artery-stenting-in-stable-patients#H3733949728\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery stenting in stable patients&quot;, section on 'Our approach to treatment duration'</a>.) </p><p>Thus, for AF patients who have undergone coronary stenting, there is a rationale to treat with an oral anticoagulant and two antiplatelet agents for some period after stenting. The concomitant use of dual antiplatelet therapy has been referred to as &quot;triple oral antithrombotic therapy&quot; or &quot;triple therapy&quot; for short. The term &quot;combined antithrombotic therapy&quot; is also used. While the use of three antithrombotic agents reduces the rate of ischemic events, the risk of bleeding is significantly increased compared with one or two antithrombotic agents. </p><p>However, the evidence is increasing that two antithrombotic agents (an oral anticoagulant plus a P2Y<sub>12 </sub>receptor blocker) may be a better choice than three for most patients given the high bleeding risk associated with the use of triple therapy. </p><p>This topic will provide the clinician with a guide for choosing the antithrombotic regimen for patients with an indication for anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting. The periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy is discussed elsewhere.

The type and duration of combined antithrombotic therapy should take into account this assignment.

It is likely that future studies will require modifications to these recommendations. </p><p>It is important to understand that decision making must be individualized after careful consideration of patient characteristics, as well as patient preferences. Many patients will fall between the ends of the benefit and risk spectrums. </p><p>Once the patient has been placed into one of four risk groups, there are two principal clinical questions that need to be addressed (see <a href=\"#H1690630613\" class=\"local\">'Assessing patient risks'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which anticoagulant should be used?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the duration of antiplatelet therapy after stenting? </p><p/><p>The answers to these questions depend somewhat on whether the indication for anticoagulation preceded or followed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as discussed in the two sections directly below.</p><p>Finally, our recommendations assume that the patient has a clear indication for oral anticoagulants (OAC).

As a reminder, in the general population of patients who have received an intracoronary stent but who do not require anticoagulation, we prescribe DAPT for 6 to 12 months.

This recommendation comes from studies in the broad population of patients with AF for whom NOACs are preferred to warfarin for stroke prevention. The rate of intracranial hemorrhage is lower for all NOACs compared with warfarin, including studies of patients with AF post-PCI. Additional support for their use comes from subgroup analysis of the RE-LY trial, which compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a> with warfarin in patients with AF. The advantages of dabigatran over warfarin were preserved in the 38 percent of patients taking concomitant antiplatelet therapy, including 4.5 percent taking DAPT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-patients-requiring-combined-anticoagulant-and-antiplatelet-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

For patients whose INRs have been difficult to manage for reasons other than compliance or in whom the risk of bleeding is thought to be high, switching to a NOAC is reasonable. A patient who has difficulty having blood drawn is an example. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients taking NOACs without difficulty, we suggest continuing the NOAC rather than switching to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>.

Until 2016 through 2017, antithrombotic therapy with three oral agents (triple therapy) was recommended as initial therapy for some period of time in most stented patients taking long-term anticoagulation. </p><p>The WOEST (2013), ISAR-TRIPLE (2015), PIONEER AF-PCI (2016), RE-DUAL PCI (2017) randomized trials compared two or three of these antithrombotic combinations for differing periods of time. In the aggregate, these studies demonstrate that thrombotic (ischemic) outcomes are not increased with OAC plus one P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker compared with OAC plus two antiplatelet agents, although it has been acknowledged that the trials mentioned above were generally not powered for ischemic events. Furthermore, two of the trials demonstrated that the risk of minor bleeding was lower, and one trial demonstrated that the risk of major bleeding is lower with two rather than three drugs. In addition, the trials suggested that outcomes were not necessarily worse if the duration of treatment with three drugs, which was previously the standard, was significantly shortened to three or even one month.</p><p>The WOEST trial randomly assigned 573 patients who were receiving long-term OAC and undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> alone or clopidogrel plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-patients-requiring-combined-anticoagulant-and-antiplatelet-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Approximately 25 percent of patients had an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In the triple therapy group, patients received aspirin 80 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily for at least one month after bare-metal stenting (BMS) and for at least one year after drug-eluting stenting (DES). In the OAC and clopidogrel group, patients received clopidogrel 75 mg daily for at least one month after BMS (up to one year for patients with ACS) and for at least one year after DES.

The indication for anticoagulant was atrial fibrillation (AF) in 69 percent of patients. After a median follow-up of 358 days, the combined secondary end point of death (myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, target-vessel revascularization, and stent thrombosis) was lower with clopidogrel and OAC (dual therapy; 11.1 versus 17.6 percent for triple therapy; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% CI 0.35-0.91), as was the secondary end point of all-cause death (2.5 versus 6.3 percent; adjusted HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16-0.93). However, the finding of such a large mortality difference in a relatively small trial is unexpected. The primary end point of bleeding was significantly lower with dual therapy.
