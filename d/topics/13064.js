This family of viruses is further classified into three subfamilies that include alpha, beta, and gamma herpesviridae. HSV-1 and HSV-2 belong to the alpha herpesviridae subfamily and the genus Simplexvirus, which are characterized by their variable host range, short replication cycle, and the ability to destroy infected cells and establish latent infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While members of the herpesvirus family share certain structural features, the spectrum of clinical illness induced varies considerably.</p><p>The pathogenesis of infection due to HSV-1 and viral mechanisms to avoid the humoral and cellular components of the immune system will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of infection by HSV-1 and other members of the herpesvirus family are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection-in-immunocompetent-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection in immunocompetent patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection-in-immunocompetent-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection in immunocompetent patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">STRUCTURE AND LIFE CYCLE OF HSV-1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HSV-1 is a double-stranded DNA-enveloped virus, with a central core containing the viral DNA, an inner core surrounded by envelope derived from both host cellular membranes and viral glycoproteins, and an icosahedral capsid composed of viral proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Between the capsid and the envelope lies the tegument, a proteinaceous structure containing two proteins important in the pathogenesis of HSV-1 infection, alpha-transinducing factor (alpha-TIF) (aka: VP16 and Vmw65) and virion host shut-off protein (VHS). VP16 is a transcriptional activator protein that forms a complex with host cell factor (HCF), which localize within the nucleus. These proteins, together with the host transcription factor, octamer-binding protein 1(OCT1), enable the recruitment of other host factors that stimulate transcription of immediate-early (IE) viral gene products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral glycoproteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alpha-TIF activates the viral replication cascade, and VHS shuts off host cell macromolecular synthesis (see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Approximately 1,000 molecules of alpha-TIF and 200 copies of VHS are present in the tegument and packaged in the virion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. Thus, these proteins can act early as virus particles enter the cells and uncoat. The viral glycoproteins embedded in the lipid envelope mediate attachment to host cell receptors, fusion of viral and host cell membranes, and envelopment and emergence of virus as newly formed nucleocapsids bud from host cell nuclei [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These glycoproteins are also the major targets of humoral and cellular immune responses and viral immune escape mechanisms by binding both complement and anti-HSV IgG molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral replication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral replication takes approximately 24 hours and begins with the attachment of viral glycoproteins to cell-surface receptors, including glycosaminoglycan (GAG) heparan sulfate and the immunoglobulin-like cellular receptors (designated nectin1-alpha and delta and nectin2-beta) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Glycoproteins gC and gB interact with GAG heparan sulfate, while gD provides a stable attachment to cellular receptors. Glycoprotein gC also binds complement protein C3b and inhibits complement activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. HSV strains with mutations in the gC gene are more susceptible to neutralization by human serum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Cell entry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Five glycoproteins have been implicated in the entry of HSV-1 into target cells, gB, gC, gH, gL, and gC; only the last protein is considered dispensable for entry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Initial interactions, however, are mediated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which interact first with gB (or gC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. An additional receptor for gB, paired immunoglobulin-like receptor (PILR)-alpha, is expressed by monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells and plays a role in both binding and fusion of virions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Membrane fusion involves gB, gD, gH, and gL. gD binds several receptors including nectin-1 and -2, herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) and 3-O sulfated heparan sulfate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Most investigators agree that during membrane fusion, gD undergoes a conformational change after receptor binding and then interacts with a heterodimer composed of <span class=\"nowrap\">gH/gL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/7,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14</a>]. Fusion domains of the <span class=\"nowrap\">gH/gL</span> complex and gB enable the virus to penetrate into cells. The viral envelope and plasma membrane fuse, and capsid and tegument proteins are released into the cytosol. The capsid travels to the nucleus via the cytoskeleton where it docks at nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The binding of capsid to NPCs triggers the release of viral genome into the nucleus, leaving empty capsids behind in the cytoplasm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Virus-cell interaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once inside the cell, the viral tegument proteins VHS and alpha-TIF begin the work of taking over host cell function. VHS degrades and destabilizes mRNA, interrupting host cell protein synthesis, and alpha-TIF forms a complex with host-cell transcription factors, which then binds to cis-acting sites on viral gene promoters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. HSV VP16 virion protein assembles into a transactivator complex with host cellular proteins, including host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) and octamer binding factor 1 (Oct-1). Oct-1 and VP16 then bind to sequences in the viral immediate-early promoters, which activates transcription of the IE genes, producing five alpha proteins, designated infected cell polypeptides (ICP) 0, 4, 8, 22, 27, and 47 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/6,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17</a>]. ICP0 and ICP4 are potent trans-activators of early (E) and late (L) viral proteins, and ICP22 and ICP27 modulate the transactivating activity of ICP0 and ICP4. ICP47 binds to and prevents <span class=\"nowrap\">TAP1/TAP2</span> from allowing the transport of antigenic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum for ultimate presentation at the cell surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Viral replication is somewhat sensitive to the presence of interferon (IFN), and ICP0 appears to play a role in bypassing this sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Another ICP (ICP 34.5) has been implicated in the enhancement of neurovirulence through its effects on IFN-inducible double stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase R [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Beta genes encode polypeptides like thymidine kinase and DNA polymerase, whose expression correlates with viral DNA synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Gamma genes code for structural proteins like VHS, alpha-TIF, capsid proteins and envelope glycoproteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Six genes are required for cleavage of viral concatemeric DNA into unit-length genomes and packaging of the virus genomes into preformed capsids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Budding and cell-to-cell spread</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After synthesis, glycoproteins attach to the outer surface of the nuclear membrane, and VHS and alpha-TIF attach to the inner surface. A newly formed nucleocapsid will bud only where these viral proteins are present. After exiting the nucleus, the virion travels through the cytoplasm in a vesicle, which then fuses with the plasma membrane to release the virus into the extracellular space or to enable cell-to-cell spread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The latter is accomplished via interactions between viral glycoproteins and receptors at cell junctions, depending on the same gD interactions with its receptors required for initial cell entry. <span class=\"nowrap\">gE/gI</span> complex and gM, which are not required for initial cell entry of virions, interact with these receptors and facilitate spread of the virus along the basolateral surface of polarized cells, achieving cell-to-cell spread. In addition, gK plays a critical role in cell-to-cell spread in corneal and trigeminal ganglia cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS OF INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HSV-1 causes both acute and recurrent disease. The most common clinical manifestation is herpes labialis, but HSV-1 also causes serious disease elsewhere (eg, the eye) and is the virus most responsible for sporadic cases of encephalitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-encephalitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute infection with HSV-1 may induce disease through direct destruction of tissues or through the induction of immunopathologic responses (see below). Tissue destruction, which is the direct consequence of replicating virus, results in mucocutaneous HSV-1. Visceral infections with HSV-1, such as pneumonitis, encephalitis, and hepatitis, also reflect virus-induced cytopathogenicity, which occurs through the same mechanisms as herpes labialis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Rapid viral replication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection with HSV-1 begins with an acute phase during which virus rapidly replicates at the site of contact. Dermal keratinocytes and other epithelial sites are the principal sites of viral replication in the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]; infected gingival tissue has been shown to be a source of HSV-1 shedding into the oral cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Nervous system invasion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While local replication does not determine the extent of mucosal inflammation or clinical symptoms, it does determine neuroinvasiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The virus first enters neuronal termini and is transported to sensory ganglia via intra-axonal flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Herpesvirus nucleocapsids have been shown to travel within axons in the retrograde direction at a rate of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Ganglia generally become infected within 24 hours of exposure, with further acute viral replication and the establishment of latency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Latency'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-encephalitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In animal models, infectious virus and viral antigens can be detected in neurons for approximately 10 days after inoculation at peripheral sites; after this time, replication ceases and latency ensues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the case of herpes labialis, the trigeminal ganglia are considered to be the site of virus reactivation and the source of infectious viral particles in recrudescent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The rate of establishment of latent foci is related to the dose of the inoculum. HSV-1 remains latent in the trigeminal ganglia for life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Another possible mechanism of nervous system invasion is viremia. HSV has been identified by culture in the blood or neonates and immunocompromised patients and, by polymerase chain reaction, in the blood of immunocompetent adults with gingivostomatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent HSV-1 infection is a chronic, intermittent disease characterized by both clinical and subclinical episodes of productive viral infection. During the cycle of recurrent disease, the virus undergoes repeated reactivations from latent infection in trigeminal ganglia neurons with anterograde axonal transport to new sites of replication in epithelial cells. Epithelial cell infection may not necessarily have to occur in order to establish latency since mutant viruses that are unable to produce skin lesions have been found in ganglia after peripheral inoculation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Data suggest that the frequency of HSV recurrences may be related to the patient's genetic background. In a study of 421 members of 39 large families, herpes susceptibility was linked to the long arm of human chromosome 21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Immunocompromised hosts are also at risk for an increased frequency of infection since the containment of HSV requires intact cellular immunity. When reactivation occurs, especially in individuals undergoing solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, HSV-viremia may develop resulting in dissemination of infection to sites that are rarely involved in immunocompetent hosts, such as the lungs or liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/30-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-infections-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of infections following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection in the solid organ transplant recipient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Latency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During latent infection, viral DNA remains episomal within neuronal nuclei, and no infectious virions are produced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Infectious virus cannot be detected in neuronal or epithelial tissue; however, explanted sensory ganglia are able to yield infectious virus after one week in culture, demonstrating the presence of infectious virus. Consistent with this, studies have shown that lytic gene expression and reactivation do occur in a minority of neurons within infected ganglia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The only viral gene products found during latency are the latency-associated transcripts (LATs) located in the nuclei of latently-infected neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/6,23,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,23,39</a>]. LATs are unsuitable for translation because they are not polyadenylated at their 3' end and lack a methyl-7-guanosine cap at their 5' end. Although these transcripts were first described over ten years ago, their function remains poorly understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/1,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,40</a>]. Most studies suggest that transcription within the HSV-1 LAT genomic focus facilitates latency through repression of ICP0 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The mechanisms of lytic versus latent infections have been traced to epigenetic regulation. Upon entry into the host cell nucleus of dividing cells, HSV DNA associates with histones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>], and heterochromatin modifications within the chromatin occur within one to two hours post-infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. These modifications include demethylation and reduced histone loading on viral IE promoters, as well as histone removal and acetylation of histones on E and L genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. During latent infection of sensory neurons, the viral lytic genes are associated with heterochromatin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], while the <em>LAT</em> promoter and enhancer are associated with euchromatin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The development of drugs that safely block histone demethylase might block the development of HSV latency.</p><p>Other experiments have shown that LAT promotes neuronal survival by blocking apoptosis, allowing infected neurons to persist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] and by increasing the numbers of neurons in which latency is established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Separate LAT genes also appear to be responsible for maintaining latency and for initiating reactivation (see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Nerve growth factor (NGF) also appears to be involved in the mechanics of maintaining viral latency. A host transcription factor, Oct-2, has been shown to repress viral alpha gene expression and NGF has been shown to upregulate Oct-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Infection of mouse trigeminal ganglia by HSV induces cytokine expression that persists long after primary infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. A possible role of the immune system in regulating viral replication and maintaining latency in the sensory neurons has been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Expression of the T cell chemokine, RANTES, and other antiviral cytokines are detectable in latently infected ganglia after HSV-1 infection of the cornea where both CD4 and CD8 T cells accumulate within latently infected ganglia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Viral reactivation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LAT genes have been linked to reactivation of HSV through various animal studies. Their absence produces an 80 percent reduction in the rate of spontaneous reactivation without affecting the ability of the virus to establish and maintain latency or the severity of lytic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Some studies suggest that a protein product of the LAT genome is linked to viral reactivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. In addition, the number of HSV-1 genome copies in individual neurons may correlate with reactivation from latency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The viral tegument proteins VHS and alpha-TIF also appear to be important for the re-expression of viral proteins.

There is evidence from human studies that acute and chronic psychological stress is associated with reactivation of both oral and genital herpes viruses as demonstrated by increases in antibody levels to HSV-1 and recrudescence associated lymphokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. A murine model of psychological stress, applied in the form of physical restraint, has demonstrated that suppression of various immune functions are the probable cause of the observed increases in viral replication during stressful circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Influence of stress on response to the virus'</a> below.)</p><p>Certain studies suggest that elevations in prostaglandins (PGE) are associated with recurrence of HSV-1. Various forms of skin trauma, which cause reactivation of HSV in humans and mice, have been shown to be associated with local elevations of prostaglandins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In vitro studies have found that the PGE inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>, inhibits HSV reactivation from latently infected mouse and rabbit ganglia, viral replication in lymphoid cells, and reduces the size of HSV-induced plaques on Vero cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In vivo studies with guinea pigs and humans have demonstrated a decrease in herpetic recurrences in individuals treated with indomethacin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Further studies are needed to evaluate the therapeutic value of PGE inhibitors in the treatment of herpetic recurrences.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNE RESPONSE TO HSV-1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with other viral infections, the successful clearance of HSV-1 depends upon the generation of a T helper cell-associated immune response with expansion of the appropriate CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>] and the initiation of a macrophage response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In the case of ocular infection with HSV-1, the generation of high titers of neutralizing antibodies is also crucial for protection against lethal challenge and ocular scarring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The generation of durable HSV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses does not appear to depend upon viral replication, as demonstrated by the immune responses generated by replication deficient HSV-1 mutants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>However, despite these vigorous HSV-specific immune responses, viral replication may proceed to lesion formation and clinical symptoms. When lesions occur, a dermal mononuclear cell infiltrate is present as early as the second day of lesion formation. The infiltrate contains mostly CD4+ lymphocytes during the first few days and equal numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte in later lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. HSV-specific CD4+ lymphocyte proliferative responses and natural killer (NK)-like cytotoxic responses are present at all stages of herpetic lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytotoxic T lymphocytes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coincident with the initial CD4+ infiltration is the appearance of IFN-gamma in infected cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. IFN-gamma has been shown to increase the susceptibility of infected keratinocytes to lysis by CTL; this effect is maximal at the time when CD8+ cells are infiltrating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Viral clearance from the lesion site is associated with a high level of local HSV-specific CTL activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The CTL may strike early, before virions are produced and before cells are disabled by infection. Thus, CTL may be containing the spreading lesion. In addition, IFN-gamma appears to counteract the blocks to antigen presentation afforded by both VHS and ICP47, producing increased recognition by CTL. This may be due to the fact that IFN-gamma upregulates the expressions of class I, TAP, and other components of the antigen presentation pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>T cell receptor <span class=\"nowrap\">(TCR)-gamma/delta</span> cells also appear to have a role in the regulation of HSV-1 infections. In two mouse models of HSV-1 infection, <span class=\"nowrap\">TCR-gamma/delta</span> cells limited severe HSV-1 induced epithelial lesions and prevented the development of lethal viral encephalitis by arresting both viral replication and neurovirulence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Once cleared, HSV persists in a latent state without further viral replication (see above).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Influence of stress on response to the virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ability to mount an immune response to infection with HSV-1 may be inhibited by stress. Using a murine model of acute footpad HSV infection, mice subjected to restraint or mild electric footshock have been shown to develop lower levels of HSV-specific memory CTL activity, lower levels of NK activity, lower levels of anti-HSV serum IgM levels, and decreased production of cytokines associated with CTL activation and function (interleukin [IL]-6 and IFN-gamma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/57,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,59</a>]. These changes were correlated with increased viral titers in stressed mice compared to controls. Thus, stress is associated with depressed HSV-specific cellular and humoral immunity and is associated with increased pathogenicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoidance of immune recognition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HSV-1 displays a number of mechanisms for avoiding immune recognition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Class I MHC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HSV-infected dermal fibroblasts use various indirect and direct mechanisms to escape recognition by the CD8+, class I MHC-restricted arm of the immune response.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two HSV-encoded proteins that interfere with host protein synthesis produce a reduction in class I expression. This inhibition occurs within three hours after infection and is mediated by the VHS and the immediate-early protein ICP47. However, CD8+ T cell stimulation requires only low levels of epitope expression for functionality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VHS has been shown to reduce the synthesis of MHC class I heavy chains and beta-2 microglobulin in mice and of HLA class I expressed on the surface of human dermal fibroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

This protein binds to and interferes with the peptide translocation function of TAP (a transporter protein that transports 8 to 15 amino acid peptides to MHC for antigen presentation), so that human fibroblasts infected with HSV retain class I MHC molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum, rendering antigen presentation impossible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Protection of virus within neurons</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The virus is also able to avoid immune recognition by escaping into neurons, resulting in infection by direct transfer between neuronal target cells.

This loss of CTL lysis is not necessarily detrimental to the host, since it may prevent spread of virions and subsequent infection (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Cytotoxic T lymphocytes'</a> above).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune-mediated complications of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain complications of infection with HSV-1 are immune-mediated. HSV-associated erythema multiforme (HAEM) is a polymorphic, self-limited, often recurring cutaneous eruption composed of macules, papules, bullae, and target lesions in an acral symmetrical distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. The pathogenesis of HAEM results from a combination of viropathic effects mediated by HSV proteins, notably DNA polymerase, and an immunologic reaction to viral antigens. HSV-1 DNA has been detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in acute and healed HAEM skin lesions, and viral gene expression is associated with lesion development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-erythema-multiforme\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of erythema multiforme&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clearance of HSV-1 DNA from the skin may be delayed in patients with HAEM. Viral DNA and proteins ingested by macrophages at HSV lesion sites are processed and presented to T cells with HSV memory. NK cells, macrophages and activated CTL directed against antigen targets in epidermal cells are recruited to the skin site, resulting in the generation of an inflammatory cascade.</p><p>Another example of autoimmune disease precipitated by HSV-1 infection is autoimmune herpes stromal keratitis. Intravitreal anti-CD11b monoclonal antibody therapy, which broadly depletes many effector cells including macrophages, granulocytes, NK cells and CTL, had been shown to suppress HSV-1 induced contralateral disease in a murine model of this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HSV-1 is a double-stranded DNA-enveloped virus with an inner core surrounded by envelope derived from host cellular membranes and viral glycoproteins. Viral replication takes approximately 24 hours and begins with the attachment of viral glycoproteins to cell-surface receptors. Once inside the cell, the viral machinery takes over host cell function. After viral synthesis, glycoproteins attach to the outer surface of the nuclear membrane. After exiting the nucleus, the virion travels through the cytoplasm in a vesicle, which then fuses with the plasma membrane to release the virus into the extracellular space enabling cell-to-cell spread. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Structure and life cycle of HSV-1'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute infection with HSV-1 may induce disease through direct destruction of tissues or through the induction of immunopathologic responses. During latent infection, no infectious virions are produced. Certain stimuli (such as stress) may lead to reactivation of virus and shedding of virions at the periphery. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As with other viral infections, the successful clearance of HSV-1 depends upon the generation of a T-helper cell-associated immune response. HSV-1 displays a number of mechanisms for avoiding immune recognition, such as reduction of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I expression or through viral escape into neurons. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Immune response to HSV-1'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain complications of infection with HSV-1 are immune-mediated. HSV-associated erythema multiforme manifests as a cutaneous eruption composed of macules, papules, bullae, and target lesions in an acral symmetrical distribution, which can be self-limited or recurrent. Autoimmune herpes stromal keratitis is characterized by recurrent corneal inflammation with scarring, which can lead to decreased vision or blindness.
