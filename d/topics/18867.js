Wounds may be caused by a variety of mechanisms, including acute traumatic injury to the skin (abrasion, puncture, crush, burns, gunshot, animal bite, surgery) and other etiologies that cause initially intact skin to break down. Any mechanism that decreases blood flow in the skin for a prolonged period of time has the potential to cause ischemic breakdown of the skin. Skin perfusion may be impaired due to proximal arterial obstruction (eg, peripheral artery disease), vascular compression (eg, hematoma, immobility causing focal pressure), or microvascular occlusion or thrombosis (eg, vasculitis, cholesterol crystals). </p><p>Wound classification and the basic principles of wound healing are reviewed here. The factors responsible for impaired wound healing and wound complications, as well as the clinical assessment and management of wounds, are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for impaired wound healing and wound complications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-of-wounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment of wounds&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-wound-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of wound management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2299102869\"><span class=\"h1\">WOUND ETIOLOGY AND CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wounds may arise through traumatic injury (including surgery) or from the breakdown of previously intact skin and are generally classified as acute or chronic. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1049419145\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute wounds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute wounds usually have an easily identifiable mechanism of injury with skin integrity disrupted, typically due to some form of trauma. Acute traumatic skin disruption can result from blunt or penetrating mechanisms with an array of wound sizes, depths, and locations. Simple or complicated lacerations, burns, or significant tissue defects may result, each requiring individualized management and care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-wound-management#H452723\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of wound management&quot;, section on 'Acute wounds'</a>.)</p><p>Surgical wounds are a controlled form of acute wound that is created in the operating room environment. Surgical wounds are classified according to the degree of bacterial load or contamination of the surgical wound and are used to predict the risk of surgical wound infection that can impact wound healing. The four categories are clean, clean-contaminated, contaminated, and dirty. The majority of clean and clean-contaminated wounds are closed primarily at the completion of the surgery; contaminated and dirty wounds as well as surgical wounds requiring removal of staples or sutures due to postoperative wound infection are left open and require wound care. The classification of surgical wounds is presented in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications#H3940540290\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for impaired wound healing and wound complications&quot;, section on 'Surgical wound classification'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1104073555\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic wounds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">wounds/ulcers</span> affect a substantial proportion of the population and contribute to a significant burden in the hospital setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment of chronic wounds&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chronic wounds can develop from acute traumatic or surgical skin injury or result from breakdown of previously intact skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F105315\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105315 \">table 1</a>). Patients with impaired pain sensation are vulnerable to acute and chronic repetitive injuries. In some patients with sensory neuropathy, the injury may go unnoticed if the injured area is not routinely inspected. Patients with diabetes, particularly those with arterial obstruction, are at high risk. </p><p>Although there is no specific time frame that clearly differentiates an acute from a chronic wound, chronic wounds are generally associated with physiological impairments that slow or prevent wound healing. For foot ulcers due to diabetes, some suggest that the lack of an approximately 15 percent surface area reduction weekly or approximately 50 percent reduction over a one-month period indicates a chronic state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-healing/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for impaired wound healing and wound complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4011539621\"><span class=\"h1\">WOUND HEALING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wound healing occurs as a cellular response to tissue injury and involves activation of keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, and platelets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58665\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58665 \">figure 1</a>). The process involves organized cell migration and recruitment of endothelial cells for angiogenesis. The many growth factors and cytokines released by these cell types coordinate and maintain wound healing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70581\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70581 \">figure 2</a>). Once hemostasis is achieved, acute wounds normally heal in an orderly and efficient manner characterized by overlapping phases that include inflammation, epithelialization, fibroplasia, and maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-healing/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. </p><p>Acute wounds transition through the stages of wound healing as a linear pathway, with clear start and endpoints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72355\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72355 \">figure 3</a>). Restoration of skin integrity following the development of an acute surgical wound in normal individuals is usually complete within two to four weeks. However, following initial successful surgical skin closure, open wounds or dehiscence may result from disruption of the sutured skin, which can be due to technical error, infection, or the presence of foreign material within the wound. </p><p>Chronic wounds are arrested in one of the wound healing stages, usually the inflammatory stage, and fail to progress further (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52383\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52383 \">picture 1</a>). In these situations, the normal physiology of the linear pathway is transformed into the pathophysiology of a chronic cycle, without a clear wound closure endpoint. Healing of a surgical wound can also be delayed or prolonged in patients with disease states that impair the healing process. (See <a href=\"#H1120878968\" class=\"local\">'Impaired wound healing'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for impaired wound healing and wound complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H779227688\"><span class=\"h1\">PHASES OF WOUND HEALING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3552939506\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemostasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediately after injury to the skin, small vessels within the wound constrict to provide at least a measure of hemostasis for 5 to 10 minutes. Platelets aggregate in severed vessels, trigger the clotting cascade, and release essential growth factors and cytokines that are important for the initiation and progression of wound healing (eg, platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor beta). The fibrin matrix that results stabilizes the wound and provides a provisional scaffold for the wound healing process. Hemostasis is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Larger vessels may require pressure, ligation, hemostatic agents, electrocautery, or other hemostatic energy devices to achieve hemostasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of topical hemostatic agents and tissues adhesives&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electrosurgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electrosurgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3856291849\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The inflammatory phase of healing is sometimes called the lag phase because wound strength does not begin to return immediately. The inflammatory phase is completed within three days except in the presence of infection or other factors associated with impaired wound healing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications#H1077172852\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for impaired wound healing and wound complications&quot;, section on 'Infection'</a>.)</p><p>Key components of this phase are increased vascular permeability and cellular recruitment. Multiple events contribute to these processes, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mononuclear leukocytes accumulate and are transformed into macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-healing/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The maturation of blood-derived monocytes into macrophages is heralded by several events, including secretion of vimentin, which is a structural filament protein involved in wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-healing/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mast cells degranulate, releasing histamine and other mediators of vasodilation and cellular migration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Release of vasoactive substances from stromal mast cells makes small vessels permeable to molecular and cellular mediators of the inflammatory response. The resulting accumulation of plasma and cellular elements is noted clinically as edema or swelling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotaxis results in migration and concentration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes that digest bacteria, foreign debris, and necrotic tissue with lysosomal enzymes.</p><p/><p>In chronic wounds, the normal healing progression usually becomes arrested in this inflammatory stage. The presence of necrotic tissue, foreign material, and bacteria result in the abnormal production of matrix metalloproteases, which alter the balance of inflammation and impair the function of the cytokines described above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1330706697\"><span class=\"h2\">Epithelialization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epithelialization (also called migration) refers to basal cell proliferation and epithelial cell migration occurring in the fibrin bridgework inside a clot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-healing/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Proliferation continues until individual cells are surrounded by cells of similar type. In a clean surgical wound, the epithelial cells migrate downward to meet deep in the dermis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77972\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77972 \">figure 4</a>). Migration ceases when the layer is rejuvenated. Following surgery, this process is normally complete within 48 hours. The superficial layer of epithelium creates a barrier to bacteria and other foreign bodies. However, it is very thin, is easily traumatized, and gives little tensile strength.</p><p>The process of epithelialization is difficult in wounds that are not primarily closed or need to heal by secondary intention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68364\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68364 \">picture 2</a>). In these wounds, the physical distance of epithelial migration is increased across the length, width, and depth of the wound.</p><p>This process may be further impaired by the presence of biofilm and senescent cells on the wound edge or base. Biofilm is an extracellular matrix produced by bacteria that irreversibly binds to the wound base, promoting inflammation and impairing epithelialization. Epithelial cells at the wound edge may also become senescent or mitotically inactive and unable to perform the DNA replication necessary for the process of proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-healing/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1393697955\"><span class=\"h2\">Fibroplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibroplasia consists of fibroblast proliferation, accumulation of ground substance, and collagen production. </p><p>Fibroblasts are transformed from local mesenchymal cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60301\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60301 \">picture 3</a>) and are usually present in the wound within 24 hours and predominate by the tenth postoperative day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-healing/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. They attach to the fibrin matrix of the clot, multiply, and produce glycoprotein and mucopolysaccharides, which make up ground substance. In addition, fibroblasts produce contractile proteins, designated myofibroblasts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F69864\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69864 \">picture 4</a>), which have characteristics of smooth muscle cells with the ability to contract and are present in the wound by the fifth day. Pulling the edges of the wound together is dependent upon tissue mobility. Myofibroblastic cells are lost via apoptosis as repair resolves to form a scar. </p><p>Fibroblasts also synthesize collagen, the primary structural protein of the body. Collagen production begins on the second postoperative day, when it is secreted as an amorphous gel devoid of strength. Maximum collagen production does not begin until day 5 and continues for at least six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-healing/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The developing collagen matrix stimulates angiogenesis. Granulation tissue is the result of the combined production of collagen and growth of capillaries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53136\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53136 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p>In pathological fibrosis, myofibroblasts persist and are responsible for fibrosis via increased matrix synthesis and for wound contraction. The exuberant scarring may impede normal organ function or, in the case of skin, result in keloid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-healing/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Keloids and hypertrophic scars&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-scarring-and-keloids-following-burn-injuries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic scarring and keloids following burn injuries&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2221077341\"><span class=\"h2\">Maturation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Key elements of the maturation stage include collagen cross-linking, collagen remodeling, wound contraction, and repigmentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77112\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77112 \">picture 5</a>). </p><p>The tensile strength of the wound is directly proportional to the amount of collagen present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-healing/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Numerous types of collagen have been identified; types I and III predominate in the skin and aponeurotic layers. Initially, a triple helix (tropocollagen) is formed by three protein chains; two are identical alpha-1 protein chains, and the third is an alpha-2 protein. Bundles of tropocollagen combine to form collagen. As disorganized collagen is degraded and reformed, covalent cross-links are formed that enhance tensile strength (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53467\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53467 \">figure 6</a>). </p><p>The maximum strength of the healed wound depends upon the interconnection of collagen subunits. Approximately 80 percent of the original strength of the tissue is obtained by six weeks after surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F69924\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69924 \">figure 7</a>), but the diameter and morphology of collagen fibers do not have the appearance of normal skin until approximately 180 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-healing/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Wounds slowly continue to get stronger but may never achieve 100 percent of their previous strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-healing/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p>The quality of healing that is achieved also depends upon the severity of tissue trauma and the presence of factors that may delay healing or reduce the tensile strength of the final scar; for surgical wounds, the suture material used in repair may contribute as well. Rest and immobility are important during the immediate postoperative period for successful healing to occur. However, some physical activity is essential during the maturation phase because light tension increases tensile strength by remodeling, which may continue for many years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1120878968\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPAIRED WOUND HEALING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is usually not a single primary factor that contributes to impaired wound healing; in fact, the overlapping intricacy of the pathway serves to prevent this from happening. Instead, there are most often multiple, smaller contributing issues that can disrupt the process. As examples, local tissue ischemia and neuropathy can impair chemotaxis during the hemostasis and inflammatory stages. Tissue necrosis and infection alter the balance of inflammation and compete for oxygen. Uncontrolled periwound edema and wound instability disrupt myofibroblast activity and collagen deposition and cross-linking. The risk factors associated with impaired wound healing and wound complications are reviewed separately.
