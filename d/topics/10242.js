The images can be further enhanced by the topical application of stains or pigments (enhanced magnification endoscopy or magnification chromoscopy).</p><p>Equipment and experience with these approaches is evolving. A growing number of reports suggest that they offer the ability to improve diagnostic accuracy for a variety of gastrointestinal disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, newer technologies, such as confocal laser endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy, are now allowing for real-time visualization of the gastrointestinal tract at a microscopic level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Magnification endoscopy will be reviewed here. Other methods for enhanced visualization of the gastrointestinal mucosa are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chromoendoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chromoendoscopy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-evaluation-with-narrow-band-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Evaluation with narrow band imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EQUIPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnification endoscopes include an adjustable focusing mechanism that permits standard endoscopic views and the ability to enlarge the image from 1.5X to 150X [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Several different models are commercially available. The newest magnification endoscopes permit magnification without loss of resolution.</p><p>Resolution is related to pixel density. Conventional endoscopes have pixel densities in the range of 100,000 to 200,000. By contrast, the newest magnification endoscopes have pixel densities from 850,000 to more than 1 million, allowing them to discriminate objects that are only 10 to 71 microns in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The technique for performing magnification endoscopy is similar to standard endoscopy. One difference (when performing it in the duodenum) is that we may administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a>, which can be helpful for decreasing contractility, thereby aiding in visualization and the application of stains. The magnification and staining portion of the examination adds only 5 to 10 minutes to the procedure.</p><p>Several topical stains and pigments (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>, acetic acid, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a>) have been used in conjunction with magnification endoscopy. The principles and techniques involved in their application are discussed separately. Of note, indigo carmine is currently in limited supply in many areas due to a shortage of the raw materials used in its production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chromoendoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chromoendoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following sections will focus on the technique involved in the application of acetic acid, for which there is relatively less experience in the gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. We have found application of acetic acid to be particularly helpful when examining Barrett's mucosa.</p><p>In translucent epithelium, the light beam reaches the subepithelial vascular network. The absorption spectrum of hemoglobin explains the red color in the surface. Instillation of acetic acid causes the epithelial surface to opacify, thereby masking the subepithelial vascular network and making the surface appear white. This change has been referred to as the &quot;acetowhite reaction&quot; although the exact mechanisms underlying it are unclear. One theory suggests that exposure to acetic acid causes cytokeratins, which are (filaments of proteins within the cells) to organize into large bundles, which increases the index of refraction.</p><p>Acetic acid has been used to stain abnormal tissues during examination of the cervix where it whitens immature and dysplastic cervical squamous epithelium. The technique has proven to be inexpensive, safe and clean. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-terminology-incidence-pathogenesis-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Terminology, incidence, pathogenesis, and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A spray catheter (several manufacturers) is passed through the biopsy channel exposing its tip. Acetic acid (3 percent) is then sprayed over the surface of the mucosa beginning from the distal extent and then proceeding proximally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The head of the bed should be elevated and the amount of acetic acid used minimized to reduce the risk of aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. As little as 5 to 10 mL is usually sufficient to coat an area of suspected Barrett's mucosa. Excess can be removed by suction.</p><p>The esophageal and gastric epithelia initially whiten. After two to three minutes of spraying, the esophagus remains white while the gastric epithelium and columnar epithelium of Barrett's mucosa become reddish, thereby accentuating the contrast between normal and metaplastic tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62055\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62055 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73908\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73908 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ESOPHAGUS AND GASTRIC CARDIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intestinal metaplasia is frequently translucent when observed with magnification endoscopy alone. Thus, the mucosal surface is not easily examined without staining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>As noted above, a variety of tissue stains have been used with standard endoscopy and in conjunction with magnification to improve visualization. Considered together, these studies suggest that enhanced magnification endoscopy improves the detection of intestinal metaplasia (and possibly dysplasia) by permitting better targeting of biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/7,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12,13</a>]. However, not all studies have reached this conclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The best results have been achieved in centers with experience in magnification endoscopy. Thus, training is required to achieve the benefits from this approach.</p><p>The following illustrates the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized prospective, crossover trial that included 31 patients found that magnification endoscopy had 100 percent sensitivity and 66 percent specificity for predicting the presence of Barrett's esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Acetic acid guided biopsies had a significantly higher yield in detecting Barrett's esophagus compared with random biopsies (78 versus 57 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study included 80 patients with suspected Barrett's esophagus who underwent magnification endoscopy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a> staining, which revealed three distinct mucosal patterns <span class=\"nowrap\">(ridged/villous,</span> circular, and <span class=\"nowrap\">irregular/distorted)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The yield on targeted biopsies according to these patterns was 97 percent for the <span class=\"nowrap\">ridged/villous</span> pattern, compared with 17 percent for the circular pattern. The <span class=\"nowrap\">irregular/distorted</span> pattern was observed in six patients, all of whom had high-grade dysplasia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A similarly designed study included 247 patients undergoing elective upper endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients were included provided that the esophagogastric junction and the squamocolumnar junction were judged to be at the same level. The final study included 195 patients after excluding 52 who had evidence of Barrett's esophagus by standard endoscopy. Enhanced magnification endoscopy was performed with 3 percent acetic acid instillation as described above. Intestinal metaplasia was detected in 44 percent of patients. Four different patterns were recognized on magnified images: round pits, reticular, villous, and ridged. The yield of detection of intestinal metaplasia of the gastric cardia according to this classification was 0, 5, 56, and 96 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fourth study involved 67 patients who underwent upper endoscopy for upper gastrointestinal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Enhanced magnification endoscopy was performed with 1.5 percent acetic acid during which the mucosal pattern was classified into three types. The overall frequency of intestinal metaplasia in the esophagus or esophagogastric junction was 39 percent. There was good correlation between the type 3 mucosal pattern and the presence of intestinal metaplasia (sensitivity 89 percent, specificity 90 percent, positive predictive value 85 percent, negative predictive value 93 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial, acetic acid was compared with<em> </em>i-Scan imaging (Pentax) for detecting Barrett's esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. i-Scan imaging is a technology alternative to narrow band imaging (NBI; Olympus) and can provide detailed images of surface and vessel architecture. A total of 95 patients were randomized. Targeted biopsies were performed in 46 patients who underwent acetic acid staining and in 49 patients who underwent i-Scan imaging. Random biopsies were performed in 86 patients. The overall diagnostic yield for Barrett's epithelium was significantly higher with targeted biopsies than with random biopsies (63 versus 24 percent). Acetic acid and i-Scan showed comparable results for detecting Barrett's epithelium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another retrospective cohort study compared acetic acid chromoendoscopy (AAC) with the neoplasia yield from standardized random biopsy protocol (SBP)&ndash;guided biopsies in the routine surveillance of patients with Barrett's esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The overall neoplasia detection rates for all grades of neoplasia were higher in the SBP-guided biopsy cohort compared with the AAC cohort (13 versus 2 percent). The number of biopsies required to detect one neoplasia was 15 times lower in the AAC cohort (40 biopsies) than in the SBP cohort (604 biopsies). On per-biopsy analysis, a 14.7-fold increase in neoplasia detection was seen in the AAC cohort compared with the SBP cohort (0.025 versus 0.0017 percent of biopsies)).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, discordant data have also been published. One controlled trial, for example, found that acetic acid enhanced magnification endoscopy was not better than standard endoscopy in detecting intestinal metaplasia in patients with symptoms of GERD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p>Magnification endoscopy has also been combined with NBI in the esophagus:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study comparing magnification NBI and high-resolution magnification white-light endoscopy in the prediction of histology in Barrett's esophagus found NBI to be superior in the prediction of histology and dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, there was generally poor agreement between endoscopists, although agreement was significantly better with NBI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-evaluation-with-narrow-band-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Evaluation with narrow band imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second study compared white-light endoscopy, NBI, and NBI plus magnification endoscopy in patients with head and neck cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In the 21 patients with esophageal neoplasia, NBI with magnification had the highest combined sensitivity and specificity (100 and 80 percent, respectively) compared with NBI alone (100 and 40 percent, respectively) and white-light endoscopy (63 and 70 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p>The clinical benefits of improved detection in the screening setting are not entirely clear. Routine application of magnification endoscopy may result in an increasing proportion of patients being diagnosed with intestinal metaplasia, particularly those with short-segment Barrett's esophagus or intestinal metaplasia of the gastric cardia, who may be at relatively less risk for progression compared with those diagnosed with long-segment Barrett's based upon standard endoscopy. As a result, an increasing proportion of patients undergoing screening for Barrett's esophagus would be subjected to the worry, bother, cost, and risk of continued surveillance, even though the majority will not develop adenocarcinoma during their lifetime.</p><p>Another unsettled issue is the interobserver reliability of the classification systems described above as well as others that continue to be proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/22-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-27</a>]. The interobserver reliability of two of the classification systems was assessed in a study that focused on 51 patients with reflux-symptoms who underwent enhanced magnification endoscopy using acetic acid or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Videotapes of the endoscopic sessions were shown to four experienced endoscopists in a random order. Intestinal metaplasia was detected in 61 percent of the patients overall. However, there was a higher level of interobserver variability (Kappa &lt;0.4). Overall accuracy was estimated to be only 50 percent, with no differences observed before or after instillation of acetic acid or methylene blue. The authors concluded that these techniques do not significantly improve the detection of intestinal metaplasia.</p><p>A high level of interobserver variability was also described in other reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/14,20,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,20,25</a>]. In one study, for example, chromoendoscopy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a> and acetic acid and narrow band imaging were compared with high resolution magnification endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Seven endoscopists with no expertise in Barrett's esophagus or advanced imaging techniques and five international experts evaluated 22 areas for regularity of mucosal and vascular patterns and the presence of abnormal blood vessels. The kappa coefficients range for interobserver agreement for these three features of mucosal morphology with white light images ranged from 0.51 to 0.53 for all observers, from 0.43 to 0.53 for experts, and from 0.51 to 0.64 for nonexperts (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glossary-of-common-biostatistical-and-epidemiological-terms#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glossary of common biostatistical and epidemiological terms&quot;, section on 'Reliability'</a>). The yield for identifying early neoplasia with white light images was 86 percent for all observers, 90 percent for experts, and 84 percent for nonexperts. The addition of indigo carmine chromoendoscopy, acetic acid chromoendoscopy, or narrow band imaging to white light images did not improve interobserver agreement or the yield in identifying early neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>By contrast, interobserver variability was somewhat better in another series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In an additional report (published in an abstract), sensitivity for detection of intestinal metaplasia and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia or early mucosal cancer were 92 and 89 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The kappa coefficients for inter- and intraobserver agreement (among six endoscopists) were a remarkable 0.959 and 1.0, respectively. It is likely that some of the variability across studies is due to a learning curve required to be familiar with the classification systems and other morphologic features of Barrett's esophagus.</p><p>Thus, greater standardization of the methods used to detect and classify esophageal and gastric cardia mucosa is needed before these techniques can be recommended routinely. At present, their greatest role may be for directing targeted biopsies in patients with established intestinal metaplasia who are undergoing surveillance. They may also be helpful for directing biopsies in patients known to have dysplasia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Surveillance and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">STOMACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A role for magnification endoscopy in the stomach has been suggested for the diagnosis of a variety of mucosal conditions. Thus far, most studies have been descriptive but have suggested an improved ability to detect premalignant and malignant lesions and to aid in assessment completeness of excision when endoscopic mucosal resection has been attempted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of endoscopic resection of gastrointestinal tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The potential to discriminate between benign versus premalignant polypoid lesions has also been suggested, which may aid in assessment of patients found to have multiple gastric polyps in whom complete histologic sampling may not be feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastric-polyps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastric polyps&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pit pattern may also be useful for identifying mucosal changes such as intestinal metaplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/28,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,32</a>], gastric atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], and early cancers that are potentially amenable to endoscopic mucosal resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. When a normal tubular pattern cannot be identified, it is called &quot;nonstructural&quot; pattern. This finding suggests that the cancer involves the submucosal layer and precludes endoscopic mucosal resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Analysis of the microvascular architecture may also be helpful, especially if combined with narrow band imaging (NBI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-evaluation-with-narrow-band-imaging#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Evaluation with narrow band imaging&quot;, section on 'Principles'</a>.)</p><p>Studies that have looked at NBI for the diagnosis of gastric cancer suggest that combining magnification endoscopy with NBI and white-light endoscopy increases diagnostic sensitivity and specificity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 56 patients with small (10 mm or smaller), depressed gastric lesions compared magnification white light endoscopy with magnification endoscopy NBI for diagnosing gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Endoscopically, gastric cancer was diagnosed if two criteria were met: (1) there was a definite demarcation line between the lesion and the normal mucosa and (2) an irregular microvascular pattern was present in the lesion. The sensitivity of magnification endoscopy was 33 percent and the specificity was 67 percent. When NBI was added, the sensitivity significantly increased to 70 percent. The specificity was also higher (89 percent), though the difference between the two modalities was not statistically significant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second study examined 201 lesions in 111 patients using white-light endoscopy without magnification followed by magnification endoscopy with NBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Diagnostic criteria for gastric cancer using NBI included: disappearance of fine mucosal structure, microvascular dilation, and heterogeneity. Cancer was identified pathologically in 14 of the lesions (7 percent). The sensitivity and specificity of magnification endoscopy with NBI were 93 and 95 percent, respectively. These values were significantly higher than those seen with white light endoscopy (43 and 61 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial with 353 patients also compared magnification endoscopy with NBI with conventional endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Patients with small gastric cancers or a history of gastric cancer treated endoscopically were assigned to either magnification endoscopy with NBI or conventional endoscopy for the detection of additional lesions. There was no significant difference in sensitivity between magnification endoscopy with NBI and conventional endoscopy for detecting gastric cancer (60 versus 40 percent, p = 0.34), though magnification endoscopy with NBI had a higher specificity (94 versus 68 percent). When magnification endoscopy with NBI was combined with conventional endoscopy, the sensitivity increased to 95 percent and the specificity increased to 97 percent (p&lt;0.001 compared with conventional endoscopy alone).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The authors subsequently did a post-hoc analysis and found that the combination of magnification endoscopy with NBI and conventional endoscopy had the highest diagnostic accuracy when specific criteria were used for diagnosing cancer (a demarcation line and an irregular microvascular pattern for magnification endoscopy and an irregular margin and spiny, depressed area for conventional endoscopy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The accuracy for the combination of the two techniques was 97 percent, compared with 90 percent for magnification endoscopy with NBI alone and 65 percent for conventional endoscopy alone. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SMALL INTESTINE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is relatively little experience with magnification endoscopy in the small bowel compared with other regions of the alimentary tract. An area where it shows particular promise is in the evaluation of patients with celiac disease and other disorders associated with malabsorption where biopsies obtained during standard endoscopy may not be diagnostic since the mucosa can be affected in a patchy distribution.

The overall diagnostic accuracies by conventional view, chromoendoscopy, and chromoendoscopy with magnification were 84 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(173/206),</span> 89 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(184/206),</span> and 96 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(197/206),</span> respectively. The authors concluded that chromoendoscopy with magnification is the most reliable method for determining whether a colorectal lesion is non-neoplastic or neoplastic during colonoscopy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of the only controlled trials included a total of 203 patients who were considered at increased risk for colonic neoplasia based upon either a family or personal history or the presence of alarm symptoms after age 60 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Patients were randomly assigned to conventional colonoscopy or colonoscopy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a> staining combined with standard resolution and then high-resolution (1.5 fold magnification) inspection. Significantly more hyperplastic polyps and flat adenomas were detected in the high-resolution group but there was no significant difference in the total number of adenomas per patient. The authors concluded that their findings do not support routine use of high resolution colonoscopy in clinical practice.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Narrow band imaging (NBI) was used in a series of 495 patients with a total of 617 lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. NBI uses a high-intensity blue light with narrow band filters that emphasize vascular and mucosal patterns. In this study, the sensitivity for differentiation between neoplastic (adenomas and cancers) and non-neoplastic lesions was 91 percent, with a specificity of 97 percent. However, a meta-analysis suggests that adding NBI to standard high-definition white light colonoscopy does not improve the detection rate of colorectal polyps or adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pilot study that included 33 polyps smaller than 6 mm compared polyp features assessed with magnification NBI and chromoendoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Chromoendoscopic and NBI pit patterns were different for 12 and 20 of 33 polyps. The authors concluded that pit patterns were not always identical with NBI and chromoendoscopy. Thus, the current pit pattern Kudo magnification-chromoendoscopy classification may need to be modified and revalidated before it can be used with confidence with NBI. The vascular pattern intensity, a simple color change, may be as accurate as the pit pattern. The role of NBI in screening colonoscopy needs further evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 studies to distinguish sessile serrated <span class=\"nowrap\">adenomas/polyps</span> from non-neoplastic tissue with an endoscopy-based image-enhancement modality (IEE), only NBI studies demonstrated significantly greater sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. The authors concluded that IEE currently cannot be recommended as a diagnostic tool for sessile serrated <span class=\"nowrap\">adenomas/polyps</span> and validated criteria are needed for NBI modality.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of enhanced magnification endoscopy is evolving. The available data suggest that it improves the ability to identify mucosal abnormalities throughout the gastrointestinal tract and thus to guide biopsies. However, the technique cannot replace histologic assessment at this time. Furthermore, guidelines on when and what to stain have not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Future studies will help determine the validity and reliability of classification systems to permit better standardization of findings.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnification-endoscopy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Technology status evaluation report.
