Muscular contractions produce positive myoclonus, whereas muscular inhibitions produce negative myoclonus (ie, asterixis). Patients will usually describe myoclonus as consisting of &quot;jerks,&quot; &quot;shakes,&quot; or &quot;spasms.&quot;</p><p>Myoclonic movements have many possible etiologies, anatomic sources, and pathophysiologic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Myoclonus may be classified by clinical presentation, examination findings, clinical neurophysiology testing, and etiology.</p><p>This topic will review the classification and evaluation of myoclonus. Treatment is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-myoclonus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of myoclonus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC AND PHYSIOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the clinical and etiologic classification discussed below, myoclonus can be classified by the localization of the physiologic mechanism that generates it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62397\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62397 \">table 1</a>). These anatomic-physiologic categories are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cortical</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cortical-subcortical</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subcortical-nonsegmental</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Segmental</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral</p><p/><p>This classification paradigm can help with localization of the underlying lesion, aid in the diagnosis of certain disorders that have a characteristic myoclonus physiology, and guide treatment options that may be useful for some physiologic types of myoclonus but not others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Cortical</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With cortical myoclonus, a focal discharge from the primary sensorimotor cortex causes a myoclonic jerk after a time interval required for corticospinal transmission. This type of myoclonus occurs because of insufficient inhibition within neuronal circuits of the primary motor cortex, primary sensory cortex, or both.</p><p>The detailed body mapping found in the sensorimotor cortex explains the common occurrence of multifocal myoclonus when there is bilateral diffuse dysfunction of the sensorimotor cortex. It likewise explains the occurrence of focal myoclonus when the lesion has a focal distribution. Bisynchronous or generalized myoclonus may occur when the focal discharge spreads through cortico-cortico and transcallosal pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Rapid generalization of cortical myoclonus can produce myoclonic seizures in certain epileptic syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Cortical myoclonus may occur with reflex sensory stimulation (cortical reflex myoclonus), with muscle activation (cortical action myoclonus), with rest (eg, focal motor seizure), or any combination of the above.</p><p>In cortical reflex myoclonus, an exaggerated cortical response to somatosensory stimuli produces the jerk, but subsequently the whole sensorimotor cortex generates giant somatosensory evoked cortical potentials (SEP) and reflex myoclonus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Rhythmic or semirhythmic discharges from the sensorimotor cortex can produce a repetitive movement that resembles tremor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>A unifying pathogenic mechanism for cortical myoclonus remains elusive, and there may be mechanism heterogeneity. The relative contribution of intracortical pathology versus abnormal activity projecting into the sensorimotor cortex is not known. Numerous abnormalities have been suspected to be important, including pathways involving GABAergic, serotoninergic, and other neurotransmitters, and cerebellar systems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cortical-subcortical</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cortical-subcortical physiology is the major mechanism for myoclonic seizures that occur in primary generalized epileptic syndromes (eg, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy) and in some other instances (eg, minipolymyoclonus).</p><p>Examples include juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and absence epilepsy, where thalamic networks are believed to abnormally couple with widespread cortical areas to produce excessive neuronal activity and myoclonic seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>]. The resulting myoclonic jerks are commonly generalized or bisynchronous.</p><p>The physiology of cortical-subcortical myoclonus involves abnormal, paroxysmal, and excessive oscillation in bidirectional connections between cortical and subcortical sites.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Subcortical-nonsegmental</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subcortical-nonsegmental myoclonus is generated from a site that is subcortical, but the crucial feature is that the myoclonus manifests far beyond the segments that are near the originating site.</p><p>The best characterized types of subcortical-nonsegmental physiologies are reticular-reflex myoclonus and propriospinal myoclonus. In both of these examples, the abnormal activity begins in a focal area of the neuraxis and then spreads in both rostral and caudal directions, producing generalized myoclonus due to the bilateral pathways involved.</p><p>There is also evidence of a subcortical-nonsegmental physiology for the myoclonus-dystonia syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The exact subcortical generating site of myoclonus-dystonia is unknown, but the myoclonus distribution extends across the head, neck, upper torso, and bilateral arm segments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Segmental</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Segmental myoclonus is generated at a particular segment or contiguous segments of the brainstem <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spinal cord. The pathologic motor oscillations in this type of myoclonus occur at a lower frequency than what is usually seen in tremor.</p><p>Segmental myoclonus manifests at, or close to, that particular segment or contiguous segments of the body (eg, palatal myoclonus, spinal segmental myoclonus).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Peripheral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peripheral myoclonus arises as a consequence of a peripheral nervous system lesion producing hyperactive motor discharges to its muscle (eg, hemifacial spasm). The possible role of central reorganization is not well defined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL AND ETIOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classification scheme of Marsden and colleagues organizes the numerous etiologies of myoclonus into four major categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physiologic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Essential</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epileptic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary (symptomatic)</p><p/><p>Each clinical category contains myoclonus arising from various etiologies and pathophysiologic mechanisms. Thus, differentiation by clinical-etiologic category is not always pure. In addition, a single etiology can produce different types of myoclonus, and occasional patients may demonstrate more than one type of myoclonus.</p><p>The classification scheme shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78331\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78331 \">table 2</a>) has been modified from the original [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] to account for subsequent discoveries and etiologies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In Olmsted County, Minnesota, the average annual incidence rate for myoclonus was 1.3 cases per 100,000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The lifetime prevalence of myoclonus in 1990 was 8.6 per 100,000 population. Secondary (symptomatic) myoclonus (72 percent) was the most common clinical category, followed by epileptic myoclonus (17 percent) and essential myoclonus (11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Post-hypoxic state, neurodegenerative disease, and epilepsy syndromes are the most common causes of myoclonus.

The same types of movements occur in the restless legs syndrome and can disrupt sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Some authors maintain that nocturnal myoclonus is too slow and prolonged to be classified as myoclonus, and that periodic movements of sleep is the preferred term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In such cases, the myoclonus is usually characterized by contractions of the tensor veli palatini. In contrast, secondary (symptomatic) palatal myoclonus is usually characterized by contractions of the levator veli palatini. Middle ear myoclonus can be either essential or secondary and is characterized by contractions of the tensor tympani <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stapedius muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/15-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-22</a>].

In addition to myoclonus, this syndrome is characterized by dystonia of variable, but typically mild, severity that often presents as cervical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> limb dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The mean age of symptom onset is six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], occurring earlier in girls than in boys (median five versus eight years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Although unusual after age 20, onset as late as 75 years has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>In a prospective report of 41 patients with myoclonus-dystonia syndrome and mutations of the epsilon-sarcoglycan gene (SGCE or DYT11) on chromosome 7q21, the myoclonus was predominantly localized to the neck and trunk or proximal upper limbs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The myoclonic movements consisted of short jerks (mean duration 95 ms, range 25 to 256 ms) occurring at rest, during action, and during posture. Myoclonus was either isolated or associated with mild to moderate dystonia. Twenty-two percent of patients had spontaneous improvement in dystonia lasting one to 20 years.</p><p>In most cases, myoclonus-dystonia confers little or no functional disability and is compatible with a normal lifespan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/24,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,28</a>]. However, the course is unpredictable, and a minority of patients develops progressive symptoms that can lead to severe motor disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/24,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,28,29</a>].</p><p>Myoclonus-dystonia is genetically heterogeneous.

Small studies have identified other putative genetic causes including mutations in the RELN gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], the CACNA1B gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], the TH gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], and the DYT15 locus on chromosome 18p11 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

The examination of a patient with myoclonus should delineate the distribution, temporal profile, and activation characteristics of the myoclonus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F51170\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51170 \">table 5</a>). Ancillary testing should be performed if the etiology remains unclear.

In addition, it is helpful when clinical observation alone is unable to distinguish myoclonus from other involuntary movements such as chorea, dystonia, and tremor. Simultaneous electroencephalography-electromyography polygraphy is the most important clinical neurophysiology study, since it can show the approximate relationship of electroencephalography activity with myoclonus, and determine which muscles are most frequently involved with the myoclonic jerks. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Clinical neurophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest clinical neurophysiology testing if a diagnosis is not forthcoming after history, examination and ancillary testing.
