This genetic abnormality results in the formation of a unique gene product (BCR-ABL1), which is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. It is this deregulated tyrosine kinase that is implicated in the development of CML. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The majority of patients with CML present in a relatively indolent phase termed chronic phase and are treated initially with a BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nilotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nilotinib</a>. Side effects are generally mild, but there are some patients who must discontinue the drug due to intolerance. In addition, second line therapy is required for the patient who has a suboptimal response (primary resistance) or relapses after an initial response (secondary resistance) to a TKI.</p><p>The treatment of patients with chronic phase CML who are intolerant of or have a primary or secondary resistance to a TKI will be reviewed here. The initial treatment of chronic phase CML and specific details regarding the pharmacology of TKIs are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors-for-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINING INTOLERANCE AND RESISTANCE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Intolerance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long term studies of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown that side effects are usually mild and most patients can continue treatment without interruption. When more severe symptoms do develop, the majority resolve rapidly within a few days after stopping the TKI for a brief &quot;drug holiday.&quot; Often, the drug can then be restarted at the same dose without a recurrence of the side effects. Fewer than 5 percent of patients treated with a TKI will be unable to tolerate long term treatment. The side effects of TKIs and their management are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors-for-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While the TKIs have some side effect profiles in common, there are some notable variations. Common side effects include myelosuppression, gastrointestinal complaints, fatigue, headache, rash, and peripheral and periorbital edema (most notably with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>). Imatinib has been rarely associated with severe heart failure. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dasatinib</a> may cause pleural effusions and rarely pulmonary hypertension, as well as gastrointestinal bleeding (probably related to an effect on platelet function). Dasatinib and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nilotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nilotinib</a> are associated with QT prolongation. Nilotinib can occasionally cause pancreatitis. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bosutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bosutinib</a> can cause transient elevations of transaminases and significant diarrhea during the first one to two months of treatment.</p><p>Myelosuppression is uncommon after patients achieve remission, but neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia can occur during the initial treatment period until the marrow repopulates with normal hematopoietic cells. Some side effects, such as severe recurrent rash or hepatotoxicity, necessitate permanent discontinuation of therapy while others, as mentioned above, require only a brief &quot;drug holiday.&quot;</p><p>There is no universal definition of intolerance. In general, we consider a patient intolerant when a grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity recurs despite appropriate dose reductions and optimal symptomatic management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase-after-failure-of-initial-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, since these drugs must be taken daily for many years, even grade 1 or 2 toxicities may be considered intolerable by some patients, sometimes leading to poor adherence to treatment. Grading of toxicities is based on the United States National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase-after-failure-of-initial-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resistance to treatment is divided into two categories: primary and secondary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase-after-failure-of-initial-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Primary resistance is when a TKI fails to achieve a desired response; this occurs in up to 25 percent of patients with chronic phase CML treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52082\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52082 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90418\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90418 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase-after-failure-of-initial-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Secondary resistance refers to relapse following an initial response to a TKI. The occurrence of secondary resistance has been estimated at approximately 8 percent at two years for patients in chronic phase treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase-after-failure-of-initial-therapy/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. A discussion of the various mechanisms of resistance is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors-for-chronic-myeloid-leukemia#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms of resistance'</a>.)</p><p>Patients who appear to have resistant disease should be questioned carefully to assure that they are taking the TKI at the recommended dose and schedule and avoiding other medications or herbal supplements which may impair efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase-after-failure-of-initial-therapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A study employing an electronic device to monitor compliance with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> therapy in 87 patients with CML in stable complete cytogenetic response on imatinib reported that compliance was an independent predictor of major molecular response (MMR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase-after-failure-of-initial-therapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients with &ge;90 percent compliance had a significantly higher rate of MMR at six years (95 versus 28 percent). No patients with compliance &le;80 percent attained a MMR. Compliance appeared to decrease among patients who had their imatinib dose escalated. Compliance also appears to be lower among patients with higher medication co-payments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase-after-failure-of-initial-therapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Imatinib blood levels can and should be measured if there are questions about an individual's compliance with the medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase-after-failure-of-initial-therapy/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. Plasma trough concentrations &lt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> are associated with higher rates of disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase-after-failure-of-initial-therapy/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors-for-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If resistance is identified, the disease phase should be re-evaluated using a complete blood count with differential and a bone marrow biopsy with cytogenetic testing. In addition, mutational analysis of <em>BCR-ABL1</em> should be performed. A newly acquired mutation in <em>BCR-ABL1</em> may trigger a change in treatment (eg, dose increase, change to another TKI, hematopoietic cell transplantation) depending upon the type of mutation found. Specific details on disease phase and mutational analysis are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Disease phase'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors-for-chronic-myeloid-leukemia#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms of resistance'</a>.)</p><p>Patients found to be in accelerated phase or blast crisis at the time of identification of TKI resistance are treated differently than those in chronic phase. This is discussed in detail separately.

Eligibility criteria for allogeneic HCT vary by institution. Patients are often excluded based on age (&gt;70 years old), uncontrolled infection, cardiac, pulmonary, liver or renal dysfunction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychosocial variables. Patients who are not candidates for HCT are treated almost exclusively with second generation TKIs. Trials that support the use of second generation TKIs in patients with intolerance or resistance to an initial TKI are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Dasatinib'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Nilotinib'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1349640\" class=\"local\">'Bosutinib'</a> below.)</p><p>Treatment with a second generation TKI (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nilotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nilotinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bosutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bosutinib</a>) is the preferred approach for those patients for whom <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> therapy is not successful. With this approach, approximately half of patients in chronic phase CML initially treated with imatinib will attain a durable complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) with a second generation TKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase-after-failure-of-initial-therapy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The response rates for patients not responding to initial treatment with dasatinib or nilotinib are less well defined but are considerably lower. Allogeneic HCT is usually reserved for those patients who have failed to respond to two or more TKIs. </p><p>Note that patients whose CML harbors the <em>BCR-ABL1</em> T315I mutation generally respond only to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ponatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ponatinib</a>, but not to other TKIs. Management in this setting is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H4261606673\" class=\"local\">'T315I mutation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of TKI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized trials that have directly compared the efficacy of second generation TKIs in patients with chronic phase CML who experience failure of an initial TKI. Phase II studies in this population suggest that they have similar efficacy. Response rates are generally higher in patients who were switched due to intolerance compared with those switched due to resistance.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dasatinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nilotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nilotinib</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bosutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bosutinib</a> can be used for most patients with intolerance or resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>. Importantly, patients with the <em>BCR-ABL1</em> T315I mutation only rarely respond to second generation TKIs; treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ponatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ponatinib</a> is preferred in that setting. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2134518457\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-T315I mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of second generation TKI for a patient with a <em>BCR-ABL1</em> mutation other than T315I is based upon the side effect profiles and knowledge of comorbid conditions in an individual patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89930\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89930 \">table 3</a>). As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dasatinib</a> might be preferred in a patient with a history of pancreatitis, elevated bilirubin, or hyperglycemia, while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nilotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nilotinib</a> might be chosen for a patient with a history of pleural or pericardial disease or effusions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dasatinib</a> crosses the blood-brain barrier and would therefore be preferred in patients with central nervous system involvement at relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase-after-failure-of-initial-therapy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nilotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nilotinib</a> can result in QT prolongation, they should be avoided in patients with baseline QT prolongation that cannot be normalized. Attempts to normalize the QT interval include correction of possible electrolyte imbalances or discontinuation of other medications that may have affected the QT interval. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bosutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bosutinib</a> is not known to prolong the QT interval.</p><p/><p>The side effects from the second generation TKIs differ from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> toxicities and patients who are intolerant of imatinib generally tolerate another TKI without recurrence of the imatinib induced toxicities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase-after-failure-of-initial-therapy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In the future, the choice of TKI may be influenced by the presence of a particular <em>BCR-ABL1</em> mutation that is more sensitive to one drug or another (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F109963\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109963 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase-after-failure-of-initial-therapy/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>Increasing the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> to 800 mg per day is another option for patients for whom 400 mg of imatinib fails due to resistance, but who are still able to tolerate imatinib.

An overview of the trials, clinical outcomes, and experience with second generation TKIs and increased doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> are discussed above. A randomized phase II trial showed superior response rates with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a> compared with increased dose imatinib [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase-after-failure-of-initial-therapy/abstract/24,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,55</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above.)</p><p>Scoring systems have been devised in an attempt to predict the response of CML to a second generation TKI. As an example, analysis of 123 patients with chronic-phase CML intolerant or resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> who underwent treatment with a second generation TKI identified two risk factors for progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase-after-failure-of-initial-therapy/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]: the lack of a cytogenetic response to initial imatinib and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or more. Patients with zero, one, or two of these factors had rates of event-free survival at two years of 78, 49, and 20 percent, respectively. Another scoring system incorporated information on the best cytogenetic response to imatinib, the occurrence of neutropenia, and the Sokal score at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase-after-failure-of-initial-therapy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Other factors that might affect the response to a second generation TKI include adherence to imatinib therapy and point mutations in <em>BCR-ABL1</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase-after-failure-of-initial-therapy/abstract/9,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,22</a>]. Validation of these scoring systems in independent patient cohorts is necessary before they can be widely applied with confidence.</p><p>HCT is an appealing option for some patients since it is the only proven curative treatment option in CML. Among patients with certain clinical characteristics, five-year survival can be as high as 80 percent. However, early mortality is in the 10 to 20 percent range. Details on the efficacy and risks associated with HCT are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation in chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Survival with HCT can be predicted with reasonable accuracy using a scoring system devised by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67260\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67260 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase-after-failure-of-initial-therapy/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. This scoring system incorporates the patient's age, stage of disease, time from diagnosis, and the closeness of the donor match. An ideal candidate for transplant would be a young (&lt;40 years old) patient in chronic phase with an HLA identical sibling donor. The five-year overall survival rates for such patients (EBMT score 0-2) ranged at the time of this scoring system's creation from 60 to 80 percent. However, with the advent of newer approaches to HCT, current overall survival rates are likely to be higher. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation in chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By comparison, second generation TKIs are oral drugs that are well tolerated with no short term mortality. Side effects from the second generation TKIs differ from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> toxicities and patients who are intolerant to imatinib generally tolerate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nilotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nilotinib</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a> quite well without recurrence of the imatinib induced toxicities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89930\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89930 \">table 3</a>). Short-term uncontrolled studies have found rates of major cytogenetic responses of 50 to 80 percent with second generation TKIs in patients with imatinib intolerance or resistance. However, follow-up with second generation TKIs is relatively short and long-term side effects are unclear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above.)</p><p>The benefits, risks, and side effects of HCT and tyrosine kinase inhibitors should be discussed with the patient in some detail before a treatment decision is made. The main factors when deciding among these options are the patient's age, availability of an appropriate donor, and the patient's interest in undergoing HCT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3202421495\"><span class=\"h2\">non-T315I mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly used approach in patients without <em>BCR-ABL1</em> T315I mutations is to initiate therapy with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nilotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nilotinib</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bosutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bosutinib</a> rather than initially performing HCT.
