Ideal lesions are intraluminal and short (ie, &lt;4 cm) such that the region beyond the obstruction can be visualized and the distal lung is functional. It is not suitable for lesions causing CAO from extrinsic compression or distal lesions (ie, beyond the mainstem bronchus). Lesions that extend a long distance in the trachea or mainstem bronchus are generally not suitable for laser debulking but laser may be used to photocoagulate and devascularize tumor tissues prior to mechanical debulking. Less commonly, it is used to treat hemoptysis, and rarely, it is used to treat inoperable radiographic occult lung cancer that is limited to the airway. </p><p>The approach to and choice of modality used to treat patients with central airway obstruction as well as a comparison between the locally ablative bronchoscopic techniques are discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72854 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64246\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64246 \">table 2</a>).

In general, it is a palliative therapy used in patients for whom other first-line treatment modalities are not feasible (eg, surgery or radiation therapy), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in patients who require immediate relief from serious life-threatening obstruction. Occasionally, it is used adjunctively before salvage chemotherapy, radiation (eg, external beam radiation or brachytherapy), or surgical resection. Ideal lesions that are suited to laser resection are short tumors (ie, &lt;4 cm) with a significant intraluminal component with or without concomitant bleeding. Its effects are not generally long lasting such that it is either combined with other bronchoscopic therapies (eg, electrocautery, cryotherapy, stenting, dilation, and brachytherapy) or repeated (usually for palliative purposes).

However, case reports of successful management of other types of malignancy have been described including carcinoid, cystic carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and endobronchial metastases from melanoma, colon, kidney, and breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoscopic-laser-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H341196394\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outcome data regarding bronchoscopic laser resection for patients with airway malignancy are derived from retrospective case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoscopic-laser-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults/abstract/1,14-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14-25</a>]. Outcomes studied are usually airway patency and symptom palliation (eg, hemoptysis, dyspnea) as well as weaning from mechanical ventilation, and survival. As examples: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One case series that included 2610 laser resections in 1838 patients with malignant airway obstruction, some of whom also received stents and brachytherapy, reported that airway patency improved and symptoms were palliated in over 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoscopic-laser-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Treatments were often repeated with the median time between a first and second palliative treatment of 102 days. Smaller series have reported similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoscopic-laser-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults/abstract/16,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18-20</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another case series of 17 patients with respiratory failure from malignancy-associated airway obstruction, laser ablation resulted in extubation and provided the opportunity for further treatment modalities in seven patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoscopic-laser-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Improved outcome was more notable in those with obstructing endobronchial tumor as the main cause of the respiratory insufficiency when compared with patients with intraluminal lesions that had large components of additional extrinsic compression. Similar results were reported in a case series of 32 patients with acute respiratory failure from both benign and malignant-associated CAO where treatment with laser resection resulted in successful weaning from mechanical ventilation and transfer to a lower level of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoscopic-laser-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A case series of 351 laser resections performed in 273 patients with lung cancer, 108 of whom also had stents placed, reported airway caliber improvement in 89 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoscopic-laser-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

In general, choosing a bronchoscopic therapy is dependent upon the tumor location, the degree of extrinsic versus intrinsic compression and local expertise, and should be individualized for each patient. Among these modalities, only laser resection, argon plasma coagulation, and electrocautery can destroy tissue rapidly and, therefore, have an immediate life-saving effect. Laser resection has excellent debulking capacity and may be as efficient at achieving hemostasis as APC but has a higher risk of airway perforation. The advantages and disadvantages of each bronchoscopic modality and choosing among the therapeutic options in patients with CAO are discussed in detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72854 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64246\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64246 \">table 2</a>).

Thus, laser resection is generally a second line therapy used for those who decline or are not candidates for surgery due to poor overall medical status, severity of other underlying disease, or the extent, location, and degree of the stricture. Similar to patients with malignancy, benign lesions best suited to bronchoscopic laser resection are short (ie, &lt;4 cm) intraluminal <span class=\"nowrap\">masses/strictures</span> particularly those associated with concomitant bleeding.

While treating bleeding areas, the zone around the bleed itself is usually photocoagulated so as to cause vasoconstriction. If using the Neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser, avoidance of direct laser application to the bleeding source itself is helpful to prevent carbonization (red rapidly absorbs the Nd:YAG laser wavelength). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H499200309\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic occult lung cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether bronchoscopic laser can cure micro-invasive radiographically occult lung cancer (ROLC) in patients who are not eligible for surgical cure is not fully established. While no large prospective trials have rigorously compared laser to other bronchoscopic modalities, case reports suggest that locally ablative therapies including laser have the potential to be effective as a treatment for early lung cancer that is inoperable and limited to the airways. These data are discussed separately.

However, for patients who have a lesion with both extrinsic and intrinsic components, the latter may be subjected to laser resection, if necessary. Similarly, patients with CAO from a cartilaginous disorder (eg, tracheobronchomalacia) are not suitable for laser. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H96642428\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since laser is a thermally ablative technique, the presence of a stent (risk of melting and fire) is also a relative contraindication to bronchoscopic laser.

In addition, the use of laser in smaller airways may theoretically increase the risk of airway perforation.

These lasers are described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-medical-lasers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of medical lasers&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36253356\"><span class=\"h2\">Principles of laser resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laser has both cutting and coagulating properties so it can simultaneously resect as well as coagulate tissue, making it suitable for airway lesions that are associated with obstruction and bleeding. The laser that is most commonly used bronchoscopically is Nd:YAG laser. Its energy is delivered through flexible fibers that are inserted through either a rigid or flexible bronchoscope. The wavelength of this laser (1064 nm) is invisible; thus, a red helium-neon beam is used to indicate where the laser energy will be applied.</p><p>An Nd:YAG laser can remove an obstructing airway lesion in two ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Resection</strong> &ndash; Resection involves directing the laser at the target lesion, devitalizing the lesion via photocoagulation of the feeding blood vessels, and then extracting (forceps removal or suction) the devitalized tissue through the bronchoscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65910\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef65910 \">movie 1</a>). The laser penetrates tissue to a depth of up to 10 mm in an inverted cone fashion and provides reliable photocoagulation at this depth. Its power density can be altered by moving the laser closer to or farther from the target tissue. Resection is generally performed with rigid bronchoscopy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vaporization</strong> &ndash; Vaporization involves aligning the laser parallel to the bronchial wall and aiming at the edge of the intraluminal lesion (the laser is rarely discharged perpendicular to the airway wall because of an increased risk of perforation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73638\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef73638 \">movie 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80129\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef80129 \">movie 3</a>). Laser pulses of one second or less are used to vaporize the tissue. Vaporization is possible because the <span class=\"nowrap\">energy/heat</span> from the laser tissue contains water. Vaporization requires higher power densities and more tissue heat than resection. Vaporization can be performed with either rigid or flexible bronchoscopy. </p><p/><p>Selecting which form of laser treatment to use is dependent upon the lesion characteristics. As an example, for dark tissues (eg, charred or hemorrhagic tissue) resection is less effective because the dark color enhances tissue absorption, limits deep tissue penetration, and reduces deep photocoagulation, leading to poor devitalization of the target lesion, such that vaporization is preferred in this group. In contrast, for large lesions, vaporization should be avoided because it is time consuming and requires high tissue heat which increases the risk of airway fire and perforation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9788450\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedural technique</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H96640238\"><span class=\"h3\">Anesthesia and ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since most laser resections are performed using a rigid bronchoscope, general anesthesia is used for most cases and the patient&rsquo;s oxygenation and ventilation are supported throughout the procedure by spontaneous-assisted ventilation, jet ventilation, or laryngeal mask assisted ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoscopic-laser-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].

However, such agents should be used sparingly and only after careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits. As an example, muscle relaxants and paralytic agents allow the airways to narrow when the rib cage relaxes; this can increase the degree of airway obstruction and consequently increase the amount of ventilator support that is required during the procedure. In addition, paralytic agents are generally avoided in patients with severe central airway obstruction such that in the event that the airway is lost, the patient may have the ability to spontaneously breathe.

We prefer rigid bronchoscopy because bleeding complications, although infrequent, can be more readily controlled (bleeding lesions are easily visible and tamponade can be achieved). However, we also use a flexible bronchoscope introduced through the barrel of the rigid bronchoscope for the clearance of small fragments of distal bronchial debris. So, in essence both pieces of equipment are often needed. </p><p>The choice of rigid bronchoscopy (performed under general anesthesia in the operating room) versus flexible bronchoscopy (performed under conscious sedation) also depends upon the bronchoscopists experience as well as whether vaporization or resection of the lesion is planned (see <a href=\"#H36253356\" class=\"local\">'Principles of laser resection'</a> above). Vaporization can be performed with either rigid or flexible bronchoscopy. However, resection is generally performed with rigid bronchoscopy because the devitalized tissue can be more easily removed with the beveled edge of the bronchoscope, with forceps, or with suction. Removal of debris is important because distal displacement of debulked tissue may result in retained fragments that can cause distal atelectasis and can promote infection. However, we keep a flexible bronchoscope available to remove blood and debris from the distal airways with aggressive saline lavage in the event it occurs. In contrast, large amounts of tissue are difficult to remove with a flexible bronchoscope in which instance, a rigid bronchoscope is required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91822023\"><span class=\"h3\">Personnel and equipment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Personnel</strong> &ndash; Bronchoscopic laser therapies should only be performed by bronchoscopists who have advanced training and experience. Most laser resection teams are comprised of a bronchoscopist, an anesthesiologist experienced with interventional pulmonology techniques and airway management, an endoscopy nurse familiar with the equipment, and a second endoscopy nurse who assists the bronchoscopist and controls the laser settings. For bronchoscopy performed in the operating room, it is also helpful to have a circulating nurse available in case of complications.

If the power density increases at a sufficient depth below the surface of the target tissue, the temperature can increase above the boiling point of water. Explosion of a pocket of steam causes a &quot;popcorn effect,&quot; which may result in tissue perforation, rupture, and hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoscopic-laser-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>Although hemorrhage is commonly encountered during laser, most cases can be treated locally due to the coagulant effect of laser itself. Should uncontrollable hemorrhage occur, intubation is necessary (if not already performed) so that measures can be taken to achieve hemostasis, the details of which are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-hemoptysis-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive hemoptysis: Initial management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For airway perforation, intubation is also necessary (if not already performed) and repair should be performed, if feasible. The risk may be minimized by avoiding aggressive vaporization of large lesions, discharging the laser perpendicular to the airway wall, and in general applying safe practice rules to the procedure.

In case of spark or flame, it is necessary to immediately cool the tissues and remove any flammable objects. Saline washing is warranted (eg, iced saline), and removal of any heated materials should be immediate. Patients will require follow-up bronchoscopy to assure absence of burn injury and collateral damage. Airway fires can be minimized by avoiding high flow oxygen (ie, avoiding fraction of inspired oxygen &gt;0.4) as well as avoiding laser in patients with stents and adhering to the precautions listed above.

It has cutting and coagulation properties which make it a useful tool for the treatment of airway disease. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchoscopic laser resection is a palliative or second-line therapy used to relieve central airway obstruction (CAO) due to malignant or benign conditions. Ideal lesions are intraluminal, short (ie, &lt;4 cm), and located in the proximal airways (trachea and mainstem bronchus). As an immediate-acting ablative therapy, bronchoscopic laser is particularly useful in patients with malignant CAO who require acute relief from serious life-threatening obstruction. Less commonly, it is used to treat hemoptysis, and rarely, it is used to treat inoperable radiographic occult lung cancer that is limited to the airway. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications and efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common malignancy subjected to laser treatment, although case reports of successful management other types of airway malignancy have also been described (eg, carcinoid, endobronchial metastases). Benign tumors and strictures that are not suitable for surgical resection have also been successfully treated with bronchoscopic laser. (See <a href=\"#H3112067\" class=\"local\">'Malignant central airway obstruction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3112085\" class=\"local\">'Benign central airway obstruction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraindications to bronchoscopic laser include the presence of extraluminal lesions causing extrinsic compression, stents, high flow oxygen, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extensive or distal lesions. However, for long extensive lesions, it can be used to photocoagulate and devascularize tumor tissues prior to mechanical debulking. (See <a href=\"#H96640971\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The type of laser that is most commonly used for bronchoscopic laser is the neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser. It relieves airway obstruction by either resecting or vaporizing the obstructing lesion. (See <a href=\"#H9788373\" class=\"local\">'Types of laser'</a> above and <a href=\"#H36253356\" class=\"local\">'Principles of laser resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most experts prefer using rigid bronchoscopy for laser resection. However, flexible bronchoscopy is occasionally used if the airway abnormality is small and within a distal segmental bronchus or as a supplement to rigid bronchoscopy when debulked tissue has moved distally and requires aggressive saline lavage for removal. (See <a href=\"#H36253457\" class=\"local\">'Choosing flexible versus rigid bronchoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchoscopic laser should only be performed by bronchoscopists who have advanced training and experience.
