Monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis usually is divided into primary and secondary forms. Children who have never achieved a satisfactory period of nighttime dryness have <strong>primary enuresis</strong>. An estimated 80 percent of children with nocturnal enuresis have this form. Children who develop enuresis after a dry period of at least six months have <strong>secondary enuresis</strong> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Secondary enuresis often is ascribed to an unusually stressful event (eg, parental divorce, birth of a sibling) at a time of vulnerability in a child's life. Stool retention and suboptimal daytime voiding habits often play a role. However, the exact cause of secondary enuresis may remain unknown.</p><p><strong>Non-monosymptomatic</strong> enuresis is defined as enuresis in children with other lower urinary tract symptoms, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consistently increased (&ge;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">times/day)</span> or decreased (&le;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">times/day)</span> voiding frequency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daytime incontinence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urgency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hesitancy (difficulty initiating voiding)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Straining (application of abdominal pressure to initiate and maintain voiding)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A weak stream</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermittency (micturition occurs in several discrete spurts)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Holding maneuvers (strategies used to postpone voiding)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A feeling of incomplete emptying</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-micturition dribble</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genital or lower urinary tract pain</p><p/><p>The pathogenesis and evaluation of monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and non-monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis overlap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The longer the enuresis persists, the lower the probability that it will spontaneously resolve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BLADDER MATURATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal bladder function depends upon a complex interrelationship between autonomic and somatic nerves, which are integrated at various sites in the spinal cord, brainstem, midbrain, and higher cortical centers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65433\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65433 \">figure 2</a>). The complex coordination permits urine storage at low pressure with high outlet resistance and voiding with low outlet resistance and sustained detrusor (bladder wall muscle) contraction.</p><p>At birth, bladder function is thought to be coordinated through the lower spinal cord <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> primitive brain centers. Voiding at this stage is efficient but uncontrolled: Uninhibited contraction is caused by progressive and sustained bladder filling. Voiding in the newborn also may be initiated by neurologically stimulating activities, such as feeding, bathing, tickling, etc.</p><p>During the first three years of life, bladder capacity increases disproportionately relative to body surface area. By four years of age, most children void five to six times per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Development of bladder control appears to follow a progressive maturation whereby the child first becomes aware of bladder filling, then develops the ability to suppress detrusor contractions voluntarily and, finally, learns to coordinate sphincter and detrusor function. These skills usually are achieved, at least during the day, by approximately four years of age. Nighttime bladder control is achieved months to years after daytime control but is not expected until five to seven years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Incomplete development of bladder control results in more complex wetting problems that almost always are associated with daytime incontinence. These include bladder dysfunction, overactive bladder, underactive bladder, recurrent urinary tract infections, and some cases of vesicoureteral reflux.

Other factors that are believed to contribute include maturational delay, genetics, and abnormal secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, vasopressin).

This observation suggests that delayed maturation of a normal developmental process plays a role in nocturnal enuresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Some studies have demonstrated an increased incidence of delayed language and gross motor development and slowed motor performance among children with enuresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The hypothesis that there is a difference in the central nervous system maturation in children with primary enuresis compared with controls is supported by neurophysiologic data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p>Enuretic episodes are associated with characteristic urodynamic and electroencephalographic (EEG) findings.

On the other hand, when neither parent has a history of nocturnal enuresis, only 15 percent of offspring are affected. An autosomal dominant form of primary nocturnal enuresis with a penetrance greater than 90 percent has been identified in Danish families and linked to a locus on chromosome 13q13-q14.3 (<a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/600631&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWHBRDRil+caVPasX6FSfeMMI2BjM1tJtpgNaUUF5QC0P&amp;TOPIC_ID=2862\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MIM %600631</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Normal bladder capacity (in ounces [1 ounce = 30 mL]) can be estimated by adding 2 to the child's age in years, until 10 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Children with nocturnal enuresis, even those who do not have daytime symptoms, have been noted to have a smaller bladder capacity than age-matched children who do not have nocturnal enuresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/36-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-40</a>]. Clinical findings suggestive of reduced bladder capacity include urinary frequency and associated constipation or cystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The reduced bladder capacity appears to be functional rather than anatomical. This was illustrated by a study in which bladder capacity was measured in the awake state as well as under general anesthesia in children with nocturnal enuresis and compared with functional bladder capacity among controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Compared with control children, the average volume of urine voided by enuretic children in the awake state was reduced: 135 versus 180 mL (4.6 versus 6 ounces) in children age four to six, 165 versus 240 mL (5.6 versus 8 ounces) in children age seven to eight years, and 180 versus 360 mL (6 versus 12 ounces) in children age 9 to 11 years. However, the average bladder volume measured during general anesthesia in the enuretic children was 206 mL (7 ounces) in children age four to six years, 229 mL (7.7 ounces) in children age seven to eight years, and 283 mL (9.6 ounces) in children age 9 to 11 years.</p><p>In another study, the maximal endurable bladder capacity during the daytime was similar between children with enuresis and controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, among children with enuresis, the maximal voided volume during the night was significantly smaller than the maximal daytime bladder capacity, suggesting that inability to hold urine during sleep plays a role in nocturnal enuresis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Nocturnal polyuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased nighttime urine output appears to play an important role in nocturnal enuresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/3,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,44,45</a>].

Clinical findings suggestive of or associated with nocturnal polyuria include majority of fluid intake during the late afternoon and evening; soaking of or through absorbent underpants; and large-volume first morning void despite nocturnal enuresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H634204340\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of ADH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children who do not have enuresis, urine output decreases during the night because the secretion of ADH and other regulatory hormones follows a circadian pattern, with increased secretion at night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>].</p><p>The relationship between ADH secretion and nighttime urinary flow rates remains controversial. Abnormalities in ADH secretion appear to play a role in at least some patients with nocturnal enuresis. However, whether these abnormalities are primary or secondary (eg, to bladder capacity or maturational delay) is not clear.</p><p>Various observations regarding ADH secretion in enuretic children have been used to explain nocturnal enuresis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial studies in enuretic children suggested that they had a blunted response to vasopressin compared with age-matched controls. It was postulated that this abnormality might permit urinary flow rates at night sufficiently high to exceed bladder capacity, resulting in enuresis. Subsequent studies failed to reproduce this observation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other studies have indicated that children with nocturnal enuresis have decreased nocturnal secretion of ADH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/46-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-50</a>], which also would cause increased nocturnal urine output. One of the reasons may be small bladder capacity, since ADH secretion is thought to increase with bladder distension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p/><p>Neither of these observations (blunted response to ADH or decreased nocturnal secretion of ADH) explains why the children do not wake to void. However, the observations that the urine osmolality of enuretic and nonenuretic children is similar, and that early morning osmolality tends to increase with age, suggest that the ADH secretion response may be a maturational one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

In contrast, no clear pattern of urodynamic abnormality has been demonstrated in children with primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis. Nonetheless, bladder dysfunction should be considered in children who have refractory monosymptomatic primary nocturnal enuresis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F100505\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100505 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

However, children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis may have a defect in the circadian rhythm of detrusor inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>When urodynamic studies are performed during sleep, the only difference between enuretic and nonenuretic children is the increased rate of bladder contractions that occur in association with the enuretic episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In addition, urodynamic studies during sleep demonstrate a relationship between nocturnal enuresis and pelvic floor activity. When pelvic floor activity increased in association with detrusor contractions, wetting was usually avoided, and the patient would often awaken subsequently to void. In contrast, when pelvic floor activity did not increase, the detrusor contraction usually was associated with a wetting episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Disturbed sleep</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether abnormally deep sleep contributes to enuresis is controversial.

This may be a bias of observation, since parents rarely attempt to wake nonenuretic children. Nonetheless, in one sleep laboratory study of 33 boys aged 7 to 12 years (15 with enuresis and 18 age-matched controls), attempts at arousal were more often successful in control subjects than in boys with enuresis (40 versus 9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].
