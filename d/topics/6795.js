The dilemma that faces the primary care clinician is to differentiate the child with transient or other benign forms of proteinuria from the child with proteinuria from renal disease.</p><p>An overview of the evaluation of proteinuria in children will be presented here. Some related issues, including the mechanisms of proteinuria, are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-urinary-protein-excretion-and-evaluation-of-isolated-non-nephrotic-proteinuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of urinary protein excretion and evaluation of isolated non-nephrotic proteinuria in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND CLASSIFICATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal protein excretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary protein excretion in the normal child is less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day or a total of 150 mg per day. In neonates, normal urinary protein excretion is higher, up to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> because of reduced reabsorption of filtered proteins.</p><p>Approximately one-half of normal protein excretion consists of proteins secreted by tubular epithelium, mostly Tamm-Horsfall protein (uromodulin). The other half consists of plasma proteins including albumin, which accounts for approximately 40 percent of the total urinary protein, and low molecular weight (LMW) proteins, such as beta-2 microglobulin and amino acids.</p><p>The normally low rate of urinary protein excretion is due to two factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restriction of the filtration of proteins across the glomerular capillary wall</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reabsorption of freely filtered LMW proteins (less than 25,000 Daltons) by the proximal tubule</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormal protein excretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary protein excretion in excess of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day or 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per hour is considered abnormal in children. Nephrotic range proteinuria (heavy proteinuria) is defined as &ge;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day or 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per hour.</p><p>There are three main mechanisms of increased protein excretion: glomerular, tubular, and overflow proteinuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-urinary-protein-excretion-and-evaluation-of-isolated-non-nephrotic-proteinuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of urinary protein excretion and evaluation of isolated non-nephrotic proteinuria in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Glomerular proteinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glomerular proteinuria is due to increased filtration of macromolecules (particularly albumin) across the glomerular capillary wall. This may arise because of anatomical or functional lesions.</p><p>Glomerular proteinurias are a common cause of proteinuria in children. They may result from glomerular disease (most often minimal change disease [MCD]) or from nonpathologic conditions such as fever, intensive exercise, and orthostatic (or postural) proteinuria, in which protein excretion is increased only in the upright position.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Tubular proteinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tubular proteinuria, which is less frequent, results from increased excretion of LMW proteins such as beta-2-microglobulin, alpha-1-microglobulin, and retinol-binding protein. These molecules are normally filtered across the glomerulus and then largely reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. Interference with proximal tubular reabsorption, due to a variety of tubulointerstitial diseases, can lead to increased excretion of these smaller proteins.</p><p>Tubular proteinuria often is associated with other defects in proximal tubular function, including glycosuria, proximal renal tubular acidosis with bicarbonate wasting, and phosphaturia. In Fanconi's syndrome, all four of these proximal tubular defects occur.</p><p>As will be described below, only albumin is detected by the urine dipstick, while tubular proteinuria is not detected by screening dipstick urinalysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Overflow proteinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overflow proteinuria results from increased excretion of low molecular weight proteins due to marked overproduction of a particular protein to a level that exceeds tubular reabsorptive capacity. Overflow proteinuria is not observed in children; it is primarily observed in adults with a plasma cell dyscrasia (eg, multiple myeloma) who overproduce immunoglobulin light chains.</p><p>As with tubular proteinuria, overflow proteinuria with low molecular proteins will <strong>not</strong> be detected by screening dipstick urinalysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MEASUREMENT OF URINARY PROTEIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several tests available for the measurement of urinary protein. The most common test, the urine dipstick, and other tests such as the sulfosalicylic acid (SSA) test that detects all proteins, measure only the urine protein concentration and cannot be used to quantify protein excretion. A dilute urine, for example, will underestimate the degree of proteinuria, while a highly concentrated urine may have a protein concentration greater than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> but not be indicative of increased protein excretion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine dipstick</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The urinary dipstick measures albumin concentration via a colorimetric reaction between albumin and tetrabromophenol blue producing different shades of green according to the concentration of albumin in the sample.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Negative</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trace &ndash; between 15 and 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1+ &ndash; between 30 and 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>2+ &ndash; between 100 and 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>3+ &ndash; between 300 and 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>4+ &ndash; &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span></p><p/><p>Dipstick testing will <strong>not</strong> detect low molecular weight (LMW) proteins. False-positive results may be obtained in samples that are very alkaline, or contaminated by antiseptic agents (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chlorhexidine</a> or benzalkonium chloride) or iodinated radiocontrast agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-proteinuria-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, the urine should not be tested for protein with the dipstick for at least 24 hours after a contrast study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Sulfosalicylic acid test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to the urine dipstick, sulfosalicylic acid (SSA) detects all proteins in the urine including the LMW proteins that are not detected by the dipstick [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-proteinuria-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The SSA test is performed by mixing one part urine supernatant (eg, 2.5 mL) with three parts 3 percent SSA, followed by assessment of the degree of turbidity. This test is infrequently necessary in children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Quantitative assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with persistent dipstick-positive proteinuria must undergo a quantitative measurement of protein excretion. Because of the difficulty of obtaining an accurate 24 hour collection, we prefer to use the quantitative measurement of the total <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/creatinine</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(Pr/Cr)</span> ratio on a spot urine sample. In particular, it is difficult to obtain accurately time urine collection in young children and infants who are not toilet trained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1040400545\"><span class=\"h3\">Spot urine sample</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The quantitative assessment is measurement of the total <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/creatinine</span> ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">(Pr/Cr)</span> on a spot urine sample is preferably performed on a first morning specimen (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-spot-urine-protein-to-creatinine-ratio-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). The normal value for this ratio is &lt;0.2 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/mg</span> creatinine (&lt;20 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/mmol</span> creatinine) in children greater than two years of age and &lt;0.5 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/mg</span> creatinine (&lt;50 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/mmol</span> creatinine) in infants and toddlers from 6 to 24 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-proteinuria-in-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Of note, spot urine protein to creatinine ratio will overestimate the actual protein excretion in very dilute urine (ie, urine Cr &lt;38.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [3.43 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> or underestimate protein excretion for a concentrated sample (ie, urine Cr<sub> </sub>&gt;61.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [5.44 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-proteinuria-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Ongoing efforts are needed to enhance the accuracy of a spot urine sample to as urinary protein excretion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2819763677\"><span class=\"h3\">Timed 24-hour urine collection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children (except neonates), levels of urinary protein excretion higher than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day (or 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</span> </sup>per hour) are abnormal. Proteinuria of greater than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per hour is considered heavy or in the nephrotic range.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Qualitative assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A qualitative analysis of urinary proteins may be necessary to differentiate glomerular from tubular proteinuria. A selective measurement, by immunonephelometry of marker proteins that include beta-2 microglobulin, alpha-1-microglobulin, lysozyme, and retinol-binding protein can distinguish glomerular from tubular proteinuria. In tubular proteinuria, these levels will be 10 to 100 times higher than normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THE CHILD WITH PROTEINURIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A positive dipstick for protein on a random urinalysis is common in children. General screening of normal school-age children and adolescents with a urine dipstick will be positive (defined as &ge;1+) in 5 to 10 percent. However, only 0.1 percent of children have persistent proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-proteinuria-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is this small subset of children who are at the highest risk for renal disease.</p><p>Proteinuria in children presents in three ways: transient or intermittent; orthostatic; and persistent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73973\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73973 \">table 1</a>). Transient and orthostatic proteinuria are benign conditions that require no further evaluation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient proteinuria is the most common cause. It can be induced by a variety of factors including fever, exercise, stress, seizures, and hypovolemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orthostatic (or postural) proteinuria is defined as increased protein excretion in the upright position which returns to <strong>normal</strong> when the patient is recumbent. It is a common cause of proteinuria, especially in adolescent males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-proteinuria-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Long-term studies have documented the benign nature of this condition, with recorded normal renal function up to 50 years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-proteinuria-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The &quot;nutcracker syndrome&quot; (left renal vein entrapment), demonstrated by ultrasonic imaging and Doppler flow scanning, appears to be a common cause of postural proteinuria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F108966\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108966 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F108965\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108965 \">image 2</a>) &#160; The diagnosis is established by a negative dipstick on the first morning voided specimen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orthostatic-postural-proteinuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orthostatic (postural) proteinuria&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent proteinuria should be more fully evaluated for underlying renal disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation begins with a thorough history and physical examination to determine the type of proteinuria. A urine sample collected during a febrile illness or after intensive physical exercise or a seizure suggests the possible presence of transient proteinuria. Other findings suggest underlying renal disease and persistent proteinuria; these include a change in urine volume or color, evidence of edema or increased blood pressure, recent streptococcal infection, a positive family history for renal disease, and hearing loss, which is most suggestive of Alport disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-pathogenesis-and-pathology-of-alport-syndrome-hereditary-nephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics, pathogenesis, and pathology of Alport syndrome (hereditary nephritis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic child</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic evaluation of the child with dipstick-positive proteinuria depends in part upon the presence or absence of symptoms. The following approach is consistent with the recommendations of the 2000 Pediatric Nephrology panel established at the National Kidney Foundation conference on Proteinuria, Albuminuria, Risk, Assessment, Detection, and Elimination (PARADE) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62887\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef62887 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-proteinuria-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In the asymptomatic child with an incidentally discovered positive dipstick for proteinuria, the first step is to repeat the test, since, as mentioned above, the great majority of such episodes are transient and do not reflect any renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-proteinuria-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The simplest approach is to measure the <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/creatinine</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(Pr/Cr)</span> ratio on a first morning void obtained at home, and to send for urinalysis a second specimen obtained in the office. The parents should be instructed to have the child void before going to bed and to remain recumbent until the first morning sample is obtained. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Measurement of urinary protein'</a> above.)</p><p>The following findings may be obtained:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A normal <span class=\"nowrap\">Pr/Cr</span> ratio on the first morning void and a normal urinalysis indicate transient proteinuria. These patients should have a repeat urinalysis on a first morning void in one year to ensure that proteinuria does not recur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A normal <span class=\"nowrap\">Pr/Cr</span> ratio on the first morning void and dipstick-positive proteinuria on the second upright specimen indicate orthostatic proteinuria (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orthostatic-postural-proteinuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orthostatic (postural) proteinuria&quot;</a>). These patients should have a repeat urinalysis on a first morning void in one year to ensure that nonorthostatic proteinuria does not occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An elevated <span class=\"nowrap\">Pr/Cr</span> ratio on the first morning void and a positive dipstick on the second specimen indicate persistent proteinuria that requires further evaluation, beginning with examination of the urine sediment, looking for other signs of glomerular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parenchymal disease such as hematuria, red cell casts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55778\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55778 \">picture 1</a>), pyuria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lipiduria. Red cell casts are pathognomonic for the presence of glomerulonephritis. Based upon the particular findings, certain patterns on the urinalysis are suggestive of glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, or other renal parenchymal disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-a-child-with-glomerular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of a child with glomerular disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-pathogenesis-and-causes-of-glomerulonephritis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the pathogenesis and causes of glomerulonephritis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The urinalysis may also be suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI) with pyuria, bacteriuria, and positive nitrites or leukocyte esterase along with mild proteinuria. Proteinuria in such children typically resolves with successful treatment of the infection. If the proteinuria persists after eradication of the infection, further work-up is indicated.

At this point, urinary protein excretion should be quantified by a timed collection, if obtainable. A detailed family history should be obtained and the parents should be screened by urinary dipstick to search for hereditary glomerular disorders.

Many nephrologists recommend close monitoring for those children with urinary protein excretion below 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day before considering a biopsy. Monitoring should include assessment of blood pressure, protein excretion, and renal function. If any of these parameters shows evidence of progressive disease, a renal biopsy should be performed to establish a diagnosis.</p><p>There are limited data on the results of renal biopsy in such children.</p><p>In a retrospective review of 53 Japanese children with persistent isolated proteinuria who underwent renal biopsy from 1976 to 1989, a significant glomerular disease was present in almost half of the patients (n = 25). 15 had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS); four had IgA nephropathy, and three each had membranous nephropathy and diffuse mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis without immunoglobulin A (IgA) deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-proteinuria-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In a subsequent case series from the same institution, 52 children with asymptomatic persistent proteinuria underwent renal biopsy from 2000 to 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-proteinuria-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The remaining 17 patients had minor glomerular changes. In contrast, only one of the 15 patients with a urine <span class=\"nowrap\">Pr/Cr</span> &lt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mg</span> had FSGS, and the rest had minor glomerular changes.

The underlying disorder may be primarily renal in origin or secondary to a systemic process. Diagnostic categories include infections, rheumatologic and immunologic disorders, and primary and secondary glomerular and interstitial diseases of the kidney.</p><p>The diagnosis may be evident and straightforward from the history and physical examination, including blood pressure measurement, or it may be more complicated, with a need for early referral to a nephrologist. Initial laboratory evaluation includes renal function tests (blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), serum electrolytes, cholesterol, albumin, and total protein. The practitioner must ensure that children with significant disease are clearly identified.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with heavy proteinuria and periorbital or peripheral edema must be evaluated promptly for nephrotic syndrome.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-course-of-primary-vesicoureteral-reflux\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and course of primary vesicoureteral reflux&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to differentiate the child with transient or other benign forms of proteinuria from the child with proteinuria from renal disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary protein excretion in excess of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day or 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per hour is considered abnormal in children. Nephrotic range proteinuria (heavy proteinuria) is defined as &ge;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day or 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per hour, and is always indicative of renal disease. The three main mechanisms of increased protein excretion are increased protein filtration due to glomerular disease, overflow proteinuria due to increased excretion of low molecular weight (LMW) proteins, and decreased tubular reabsorption. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Abnormal protein excretion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common screening test for proteinuria is urinary dipstick test that measures albumin concentration via a colorimetric reaction. It cannot be used to quantify protein excretion, and it does not detect LMW proteins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with persistent dipstick-positive proteinuria must undergo a quantitative measurement of protein excretion. Quantitative measurements include a timed 24-hour urine collection or measurement of the total <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/creatinine</span> ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">(mg/mg)</span> on a spot urine sample, preferably the first morning specimen (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-spot-urine-protein-to-creatinine-ratio-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Quantitative assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both benign and serious conditions can cause proteinuria in children. Childhood proteinuria presents in three ways: transient or intermittent, orthostatic, and persistent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73973\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73973 \">table 1</a>). Transient and orthostatic proteinuria are benign conditions that require no further evaluation. General screening of normal school-age children and adolescents with a urine dipstick will be positive (defined as &ge;1+) in 5 to 10 percent. However, only 0.1 percent of children have persistent proteinuria. It is this small subset of children who are at the highest risk for renal disease. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the child with proteinuria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of a child with persistent proteinuria begins with a thorough history and physical examination. Further evaluation is based on the clinical manifestations elicited by the history and physical examination. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the child with proteinuria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Asymptomatic child &ndash; In the asymptomatic child, repeat testing for proteinuria is generally performed to determine whether the proteinuria is transient, orthostatic, or persistent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62887\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef62887 \">algorithm 1</a>). In patients with transient or orthostatic proteinuria, a repeat urinalysis on a first morning void should be obtained in one year. Further work-up is warranted in children with persistent proteinuria including renal function tests, and serum electrolytes, cholesterol, albumin, and total protein. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic child'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Symptomatic child &ndash; The evaluation is based on the clinical manifestations that may be general and nonspecific (eg, fever, malaise, weight loss), nonurinary specific (eg, rash, purpura, arthritis), or urinary specific (eg, edema, hypertension, renal insufficiency). In some cases, the diagnosis is evident based on the clinical findings, whereas it may be more subtle and complicated in others, requiring further testing or referral to a pediatric nephrologist.
