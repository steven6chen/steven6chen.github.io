Resorption of osteoid occurs through osteoclast activity. Resorption actively occurs even in growing children. This allows bone remodeling as bones increase in circumference and length. Length is added to bones in the epiphyseal plate, a metabolically active zone in which chondrocytes and cartilage are converted to osteocytes and calcified matrix. The relatively faster rate of bone formation compared with rate of bone resorption leads to growth in bone size and increase in bone mineral density (BMD). Bone strength and fracture risk are related to bone size, BMD, and microstructural architecture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-skeletal-development-and-regulation-of-bone-formation-and-resorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal skeletal development and regulation of bone formation and resorption&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Both bone size and BMD increase gradually through the childhood years with more rapid increases during puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Calcium is added to bone most rapidly between ages 9 and 15 years in girls, and between ages 10 and 18 years in boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. After adult height is achieved, bone size remains stable, but BMD continues to increase until age reaches the mid-to-late 20s (peak bone mass). Subsequently, bone mass and BMD decline very gradually throughout the rest of adult life. If peak bone mass is lower, osteoporosis and fractures may occur earlier in adult life. Bone growth and remodeling are regulated by endogenous hormones, including growth hormone, sex steroids, growth factors, and cytokines, as well as exogenous factors such as nutrition including vitamin D, and weight-bearing exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects of cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Childhood cancer can affect bone metabolism and growth through a variety of mechanisms.

Studies have shown that cancer survivors are very likely to have vitamin D deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>], but this is similar to the general population.</p><p/><p>Children are particularly sensitive to the above effects because of their rapid bone growth and turnover.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">AVASCULAR NECROSIS (OSTEONECROSIS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Avascular necrosis (AVN), also known as aseptic osteonecrosis, is a serious complication of chemotherapy that can destroy the bone underlying the articular surface of the joints, especially the weight-bearing joints of the lower extremities. AVN is usually associated with high dose glucocorticoid treatment and bone marrow transplantation, but it has occasionally been reported in association with other types of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/9-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-15</a>]. Adolescent patients are disproportionately affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/9,10,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,14,15</a>]. AVN commonly presents with pain upon weight-bearing but may be asymptomatic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Between 2 and 10 percent of children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) develop symptomatic AVN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/10,16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16-19</a>]. In one study, the rate of symptomatic AVN was 17 percent (10 percent in children younger than 10 years, and 45 percent in children older than 10 years), and the overall rate of asymptomatic disease was 72 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These rates are higher than in previous reports, probably because this study employed routine screening by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during reinduction therapy, and identified symptomatic disease when minimal dysfunction was present. Most cases of AVN occur during or shortly after chemotherapy, ranging from 6 to 53 months after initiation of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/9,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,16</a>]. One long-term study suggests that AVN can develop years after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>AVN is a particularly common complication of treatment for ALL, but it also affects a substantial portion of patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) who receive glucocorticoids as primary treatment or for graft-versus-host disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/14,16,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16,21</a>]. AVN is also seen in association with other malignancies that are treated with glucocorticoids, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and other leukemias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/9,11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient's age and the dose and duration of glucocorticoid treatment are important risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/10,14,20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,20,22</a>]. Most cases of chemotherapy-associated AVN occur in children and adolescents over 10 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/9,14,15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14,15,17</a>]. This is probably because rapid bone growth and bone turnover in this age group accelerate the pathologic effects of the glucocorticoids. Several studies have suggested that the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a>, and exposure to radiation therapy (particularly gonadal radiation) contribute to the risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Studies conflict in their conclusions about whether white race and female gender confer additional risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/17,20,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20,23,24</a>]. Genetic polymorphisms, elevated lipid levels, and obesity may also contribute to the risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/17,23,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,23,25-27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids are the main cause of AVN in children with malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The reasons for this association and other contributing factors are not clear. AVN probably begins with an interruption of the blood supply to the bone, possibly because of fat emboli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Subsequently, the adjacent area becomes hyperemic, resulting in demineralization and trabecular thinning. When subjected to physical stress (such as weight-bearing), the bone collapses. The potential contribution from other components of chemotherapy (particularly antimetabolites such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methotrexate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mercaptopurine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mercaptopurine</a>) has not been established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis of bone)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AVN typically presents as a limp and bone or joint pain, usually occurring while the patient is receiving high dose glucocorticoids. Most cases of symptomatic AVN involve weight-bearing joints (eg, the femoral head and femoral and tibial condyles), but multiple joints are often affected in the same patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The joint is usually initially evaluated by plain radiograph, mostly to identify other potential sources of pain, such as fracture or bony metastasis. However, a normal plain radiograph does not exclude AVN, and any patient at risk for AVN with unexplained joint pain should be further evaluated by MRI, which is far more sensitive and specific than plain radiographs for detection of AVN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of radionucleotide bone scans is intermediate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for AVN usually depends on the severity of the lesion, but there are no established criteria for determining severity in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Most cases are treated with an initial trial of conservative therapy, with advancement to surgical intervention when necessary. One study has shown reduction of pain and improved motor function with bisphosphonate therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Conservative therapy includes restriction of weight-bearing and avoidance of abduction; pendulum exercises may be helpful. If possible, a decrease or modification of glucocorticoid dose may improve the condition.</p><p>Conservative therapy is ineffective for many patients with chemotherapy-related AVN of the hip or knee. Among patients who developed chemotherapy-related AVN, 30 to 60 percent required surgical intervention, consisting of core decompression or joint replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/9,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,16</a>]. More extensive AVN is more likely to require surgical intervention. In one series, 80 percent of patients with lesions occupying more than 30 percent of the femoral head volume had joint collapse within two years of diagnosis, and 50 percent required arthroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Other treatment approaches include bisphosphonates, prostacyclin analog (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=iloprost-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iloprost</a>), electrical stimulation, or hyperbaric oxygen, but none of these interventions has been sufficiently studied to determine if they are useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/9,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,33,34</a>].

SCFE occurs with increased frequency in overweight or actively growing children and adolescents, in patients after renal transplant or in renal failure, in girls with Turner syndrome, in obese pubertal boys, and in patients with growth hormone deficiency or those receiving growth hormone therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The latter is relevant for survivors of childhood cancer, some of whom develop growth hormone deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Growth hormone deficiency'</a> below.)</p><p>There appears to be a weak association between SCFE and radiation therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy. Direct radiation to the hip appears to be the most consistent association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Most of the reported cases underwent cancer treatment in early childhood and presented with SCFE during late childhood (mean 10 years), which is younger than the usual age of onset of SCFE in the absence of cancer treatment.</p><p>The evaluation, diagnosis, and management of SCFE are discussed in detail in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">ALTERED EPIPHYSEAL GROWTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epiphyseal growth is altered temporarily during cancer therapy, but is altered also in a lasting manner after certain types of chemotherapy and after irradiation to epiphyses. Children undergoing intensive chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) typically display a marked deceleration in growth velocity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], generally followed by catch-up growth after chemotherapy is complete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Agents that directly alter bone growth include glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">doxorubicin</a>, actinomycin D, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methotrexate</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cisplatin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. </p><p>Direct irradiation to long bones and the vertebral column can retard bone growth. The risk is increased in younger patients and with regional radiation doses of more than 20 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Regional or cranial radiation and chemotherapy can also have indirect effects on bone growth by disrupting growth-promoting hormones, including growth hormone, IGF-I, gonadal steroids, and thyroid hormones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. HYPOthyroidism is an important consequence of radiotherapy and contributes to growth failure. HYPERthyroidism is less common, but when present, it can impair bone mineralization. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Reduced bone mineral density'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endocrinopathies-in-cancer-survivors-and-others-exposed-to-cytotoxic-therapies-during-childhood\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endocrinopathies in cancer survivors and others exposed to cytotoxic therapies during childhood&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Abnormality of each of these factors may disrupt epiphyseal growth. The effects on longitudinal growth may be seen only transiently during chemotherapy, or may persist and compromise adult height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/39,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,42</a>]. In most cases, trunk length (sitting height) is affected more than standing height, because of additive effects on each of the many epiphyses in the vertebral column [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Patients undergoing treatment at an age when growth is normally rapid (early childhood or early puberty) are most likely to have measurable effects on linear growth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">REDUCED BONE MINERAL DENSITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) is particularly common among survivors of hematologic malignancies and brain tumors. Some of the risk seems to be related to the underlying cancer: bone mineral is already decreased, compared with normal for age, at the time of diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy further increase these risks.</p><p>Reduced BMD is often clinically invisible and unrecognized until a fracture occurs. Symptoms of fractures associated with osteoporosis may include bone pain, abnormal gait, vertebral collapse, back pain, or low-impact fractures.</p><p>Most survivors of childhood cancer will regain bone mass with increasing time after therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/34,45-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,45-50</a>]. However, BMD may be permanently reduced if the cancer or its treatment reduces peak bone mass, so children treated for cancer during puberty are particularly at risk. In addition, there may be progressive effects on BMD if the individual has a treatment-related endocrinopathy (eg, growth hormone deficiency or hypogonadism), or nephropathy causing chronic renal phosphate loss (eg. Fanconi syndrome associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ifosfamide</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adults, osteopenia is defined as BMD that is more than 1 SD below the mean (expressed as a T-score &lt;-1), and osteoporosis is defined as BMD that is more than 2.5 SD below the mean (with the mean based on the standard of young adults). BMD is most commonly measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) or, at some centers, by quantitative computed tomography (QCT). (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'BMD measurement'</a> below.)</p><p>In children, comparison of BMD to adult standards is not a good predictor of current fracture risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Therefore, use of age- and gender-based standards (Z-scores) is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/30,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,51</a>]. A Z-score &lt;-2.0 defines reduced BMD. Correction for body size (for height age) is important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In children, the term &quot;osteoporosis&quot; is not used unless there is a clinically significant fracture history, such as fracture of lower extremity long bone, two episodes of upper extremity long bone fractures, or vertebral compression fracture.</p><p>Primary osteoporosis results from the gradual losses of BMD resulting from aging and menopause. Secondary osteoporosis is caused by other medical disorders, including cancer and cancer treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of studies have reported reduced BMD in long-term survivors of cancer in pediatric patients, particularly those affected by brain tumors or leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/16,48,54-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,48,54-63</a>]. Therapy for solid tumors can also lead to reduced BMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Reduced BMD (as measured in the lumbar spine) has been reported in 8 to 23 percent of leukemia survivors who received chemotherapy prior to epiphyseal closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>], and in 45 percent of survivors treated with cranial radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. In one study of 155 patients with ALL, 16 percent had vertebral fractures identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during the first 12 months of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. In another study of young adults who had been treated with chemotherapy for bone sarcoma, BMD reduction was observed in 58 percent of survivors during a mean follow up period of seven to eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-problems-in-childhood-cancer-patients/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

Gonadal dysfunction may develop after radiation doses to the ovaries of 10 Gy or more in prepubertal age, and 5 Gy or more during puberty.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some cases, reductions in bone mineralization and linear growth are caused by disruption of growth hormone, gonadal hormones, or thyroid hormones. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Reduced bone mineral density'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Altered epiphyseal growth'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All childhood cancer patients should be counseled to maintain recommended intakes of calcium (usually 1000 to 1500 mg daily, depending on age) and vitamin D, even during cancer therapy. Recommended intake of vitamin D is 600 units daily for healthy children and adolescents, but many individuals require doses of 1000 to 2000 units daily to achieve optimal serum vitamin D levels. Patients should be encouraged to adopt habits supporting bone health (weight-bearing exercise and avoid smoking). (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Prevention and treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avascular necrosis typically presents as a limp and pain in weight-bearing joints, usually occurring while the patient is receiving high dose glucocorticoids. A normal plain radiograph does not exclude AVN, and any patient at risk for AVN with unexplained joint pain should be further evaluated by MRI. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Avascular necrosis (Osteonecrosis)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that all patients exposed to therapies expected to reduce BMD (including glucocorticoids, cranial radiation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methotrexate</a>, or hematopoietic cell transplant) have a quantitative measure of BMD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). The initial assessment should be done at the time of entry into long-term follow up, or when symptomatic bone-related disease develops, whichever comes first. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'BMD measurement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All childhood cancer patients should be carefully monitored for growth rates and pubertal progression during and after cancer treatment. Patients with growth failure or deceleration, or those with delayed or interrupted progression of puberty, or accelerated puberty should be evaluated. Likewise, patients with significant BMD deficits (Z-scores &lt;-2) should be evaluated for endocrinopathies. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Endocrine evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endocrinopathies-in-cancer-survivors-and-others-exposed-to-cytotoxic-therapies-during-childhood\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endocrinopathies in cancer survivors and others exposed to cytotoxic therapies during childhood&quot;</a>.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Camacho-H&uuml;bner C.
