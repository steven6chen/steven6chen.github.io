The epidemiology, effects, and treatment of children who are exposed to IPV and some aspects of diagnosing, screening, and counseling caregivers for IPV are reviewed here. A more thorough discussion of diagnosing, screening, and counseling women for IPV is provided separately.

Exposure to such violence is a major threat to children's health and well-being [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]. It has deleterious effects on a child's developing brain resulting in long-term adverse consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Data from the Adverse Childhood Experiences studies indicate that adverse childhood experiences, such as exposure to IPV, dramatically affect adult mental and physical health and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. In addition, in an observational study, childhood exposure to IPV was associated with being a victim (for women) and perpetrator (for men) of IPV in adult relationships [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Effects'</a> below.)</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics encourages health care professionals to use an ecobiodevelopmental framework to understand how exposure to toxic stress (eg, domestic or community violence, maternal depression, parental substance abuse, food scarcity, poor social connectedness) during childhood can lead to permanent changes in learning, behavior, and physiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/11,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,18</a>]. Chronic toxic stress in childhood causes physiologic changes that lead to stress-related chronic illness and unhealthy lifestyles in adulthood.</p><p>Family violence has a significant impact on an individual's health, as well as community health and health care resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. IPV frequently remains undiagnosed because victims may conceal that they are in abusive relationships and the clues pointing to abuse may be subtle or absent. Pediatricians are well-placed to identify maternal IPV because victims of IPV seek health care for their children, even if they do not for themselves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H245691900\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intimate partner violence is a pattern of coercive behaviors that may include repeated sexual and physical violence, psychologic abuse, progressive social isolation, deprivation, intimidation, stalking, and reproductive coercion. These behaviors are perpetrated by someone who is or was involved in an intimate relationship with the victim and are used to establish power and control over the victim [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Abusive relationships are characterized by episodic, unpredictable outbursts by the abuser that often begin as verbal and emotional abuse but, over time, tend to become physical. As the abusive relationship continues, the victim begins to live in a state of constant fear, terrified about when the next episode of abuse will occur.</p><p>&quot;Witnessed violence&quot; is verbal or physical violence that is heard or seen by a child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, the definition of child witness to violence is expanded to include not only the actual observation of the violence or abuse, but also the observation of the effects of the violence suffered by the victim, such as visible injuries, bruises, intimidation, and fear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The abusive behavior that may be witnessed by children in the home ranges from loud arguments to hitting, shoving, slapping, punching, and potentially lethal assaults (eg, strangulation or the use of a weapon) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a common form of violence against women and men, with one in three women and nearly one in three men experiencing sexual violence, physical violence, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stalking by an intimate partner at some point in their lives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Each year in the United States, IPV is estimated to result in an estimated 1200 deaths, 2 million injuries to women, and nearly 600,000 injuries to men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Large proportions of women and men report having experienced various types of IPV during their lifetime (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96993\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96993 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Partner violence often begins in adolescence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96994\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96994 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Female victims of IPV are more likely than male victims to experience injury, severe physical violence, and sexual violence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/2,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,24</a>]. They are also more likely to be killed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (2015) indicate that among the homicides that involved one female victim and one male offender in which the victim knew the offender, 64 percent of victims were killed by their current or previous partner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>It is estimated that up to 15.5 million children (30 percent of the United States population of children) live in homes where IPV occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In the 2014 National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence, approximately 6 percent of children reported witnessing an assault between parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. These estimates probably underrepresent the true incidence because many cases of IPV go unreported. Children living in such homes become involved in the violence in a variety of ways, eg, they can sustain injuries either intentionally or unintentionally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], try to stop the violence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], affect the mother's decision-making process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>], and are at high risk to becoming victims of child abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/6,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,38</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for maternal IPV identified in observational studies include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/38-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-50</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107303\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107303 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age 20 to 34 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal disability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of physical injury during pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mother directly or indirectly refers to IPV</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol or substance abuse in the home</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal history of depression, anxiety, suicidality</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a child with alleged or confirmed child maltreatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not following through with recommended treatments for self or child(ren)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronically missing appointments for self or child(ren)</p><p/><p>Risk factors for paternal IPV have not been systematically assessed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isolating the quantitative contribution of repeated exposure to violence, family dysfunction, and social stressors from the effects of witnessing intimate partner violence (IPV) is difficult because these variables usually occur in combination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].

Positive relationships in the family, safe, stable, nurturing parenting, a supportive environment outside the home, fewer social stressors (eg, poverty, low educational level of parents, parental substance abuse), fewer maternal health problems, and less severe violence exposure are protective factors for children who are exposed to IPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/65-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-68</a>].

Younger children may become disengaged from the chaos around them, which professionals and family members may view as a sign that the child is not affected. As children get older, coping strategies may include using alcohol and drugs to escape the mental anguish of experiencing the abuse; taking on different family roles (eg, becoming the caregiver of younger siblings, being a confidant to the mother or father, trying to mediate peace between the adults); actively seeking to understand and prevent triggers wrongly perceived as the cause of the violence; and taking on the overwhelming burden of the false assumption that they are the cause of the violence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Parent-child interaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who live in homes with IPV may be blamed as the cause of the parental conflict.

When individuals who were exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) as children become parents, it is particularly important to provide guidance for appropriate styles of communication and discipline. Clinicians should discuss communication and discipline with parents during routine well-child visits. Offer the following tips:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parents should avoid arguing in front of, or in earshot of, children: This avoids modeling of inappropriate behavior by the child.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parents should be consistent with their rules, which should be agreed upon in the child's presence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each parent should maintain good communication with each child, which fosters a healthy relationship.</p><p/><p>Review with parents the negative effects of interspousal conflicts.

These behaviors are perpetrated by someone who is or was involved in an intimate relationship with the victim and are used to establish power and control over the victim.
