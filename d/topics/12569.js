Treatments should be individualized to the patient&rsquo;s functional status, disease severity, occupational and vocational needs, and the nature of any coexisting medical problems. The patient&rsquo;s expectations should be discussed to ensure they are realistic.</p><p>Surgical interventions for patients with OA are generally reserved for those who have failed less invasive modes of therapy. This topic will review the effectiveness of surgical approaches used to treat OA. Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches to the treatment of OA other than surgery are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoarthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis#H4068513063\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Refractory symptoms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H48387070\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total joint arthroplasty (replacement) is the definitive treatment for osteoarthritis (OA) in patients who have failed nonoperative interventions. The indications for pursuing a total knee or hip arthroplasty are discussed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-knee-arthroplasty#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Total knee arthroplasty&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-hip-arthroplasty#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Total hip arthroplasty&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>). In addition, a variety of other surgical procedures may be considered in selected patients with OA. In younger patients with less severe <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> more localized areas of OA, alternative procedures may include joint resurfacing, autologous chondrocyte transplantation, and unicompartmental arthroplasty. Some patients with OA secondary to varus or valgus knee deformities or congenital hip dysplasia may benefit from an osteotomy.</p><p>Surgical procedures that have been used to treat OA which are generally not recommended include joint irrigation, arthroscopic debridement, arthroscopic abrasion arthroplasty, and arthroscopic synovectomy. There may be a role for arthroscopic debridement in younger patients with a labral tear or femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) of the hip without advanced OA, but additional studies are needed to establish the efficacy of this procedure for these indications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">JOINT IRRIGATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H785275868\"><span class=\"h2\">Knee</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not recommend the use of joint irrigation (or lavage) in the treatment of knee ostearthritis (OA). Joint irrigation consists of rinsing out the knee with fluid, and can be done arthroscopically or non-arthroscopically. It is thought that joint irrigation relieves knee pain secondary to OA by removing cartilaginous debris and inflammatory cytokines, which may contribute to synovitis and pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Although a few initial studies had suggested a potential benefit of joint irrigation for knee OA by reducing pain and improving function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>], subsequent studies failed to support these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The best quality review reported no evidence of benefit with joint irrigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In this systematic review, the efficacy of joint irrigation for the treatment of knee OA was evaluated using data from 567 patients from seven randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients who underwent joint lavage were compared with a control group who received either a sham intervention mimicking joint lavage, a placebo injection, or a non-intervention control. Joint lavage was found to be no more effective in pain reduction than control interventions at three-month follow-up (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.11, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.21). Also, joint lavage did not show an improvement in function compared with control interventions (SMD -0.10, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.11).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H785275874\"><span class=\"h2\">Hip</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no clinical evidence to support joint irrigation in the treatment of hip OA, and we do not recommend its use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ARTHROSCOPIC DEBRIDEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H785275893\"><span class=\"h2\">Knee</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arthroscopic intervention for osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is not recommended in most cases. Furthermore, there is no role for arthroscopic surgery in the treatment of advanced OA of the knee. Despite this, arthroscopic debridement has been widely used as a therapeutic intervention for patients with symptomatic OA of the knee, with or without a meniscal tear. However, the efficacy in treating such patients with arthroscopic debridement is not supported by randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/9,11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11-15</a>]. Further research is needed to determine whether there is any subset that may be more likely to benefit from this procedure (eg, patients with mechanical symptoms such as locking, catching, or buckling and only mild arthritic changes).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H785276752\"><span class=\"h3\">Isolated osteoarthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following studies demonstrate the lack of clinical efficacy of arthroscopic debridement in the treatment of isolated knee OA:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a trial including 180 predominantly white, male patients under 75 years of age with knee OA, patients were randomly assigned to arthroscopic lavage, arthroscopic debridement and lavage, or sham surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. During the 24-month follow-up period, there were no differences in knee pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function among patients who received lavage, debridement, or the sham surgery. A limitation of the study was related to the study population, which included few women, who typically have a higher prevalence OA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another randomized trial of 178 patients with moderate to severe knee OA evaluated arthroscopic debridement and lavage in combination with medical and physical therapy versus medical and physical therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. At two years, there was no significant difference in Western Ontario McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scores, which is a validated instrument for OA of the knee and hip that includes an assessment of pain, stiffness, and physical function.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H785276767\"><span class=\"h3\">Osteoarthritis plus a meniscal tear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial studies evaluating the efficacy of arthroscopic debridement for knee OA were criticized for not including patients who also had a meniscal tear. Observational studies reported high rates of improvement with arthroscopic partial meniscectomy and debridement in patients with predominantly mechanical symptoms (such as catching or locking of the knee), mild to moderate OA on radiograph, and shorter disease duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. Patients with documented intraarticular loose bodies also appeared to benefit from arthroscopic debridement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>However, subsequent randomized trials and a systematic review including patients with symptomatic OA and documented meniscal tears found no greater benefit with arthroscopic surgery followed by physical therapy, compared with physical therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/12-14,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14,21</a>]. This was best shown in a systematic review including seven randomized trials that compared the effects of arthroscopic meniscal debridement with nonoperative or sham treatments in patients with degenerative meniscal tears and knee pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The pooled treatment effect of arthroscopic surgery did not show a statistically significant or minimally important difference between the treatment arms for long-term (greater than two years) functional outcomes. The minimally important difference was defined as the smallest effect that an informed patient would perceive as valuable enough to justify a change in therapeutic management. Arthroscopic debridement did demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in short-term (less than six months) functional outcomes; however, the difference was not clinically meaningful. Finally, there were no statistically significant differences in pain between the treatment arms at both short- and long-term follow-up periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Another systematic review that did not find a significant benefit of arthroscopic debridement patients with or without knee OA included nine randomized trials which compared the effect of arthroscopic knee surgery with control treatments in almost 1300 patients with knee pain, with or without radiographic signs of OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The arthroscopic procedures included partial meniscectomy, debridement, or both, and the control treatments included sham surgery, exercise, or medical treatment. A statistically significant but not clinically meaningful difference in pain relief was observed at three and six months in favor of arthroscopic interventions; however, this difference was not observed at later time points for up to two years. Subgroup analyses limited to patients with knee pain and radiographic OA found similar results. A meta-analysis of nine studies with data on adverse events after knee arthroscopy found that deep venous thrombosis was the most frequently reported event (4 per 1000 arthroscopies), followed by infection, pulmonary embolism, and death. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H785276782\"><span class=\"h2\">Hip</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no established role for the use of hip arthroscopy in the treatment of advanced OA of the hip, and no randomized studies have been performed. Arthroscopic surgery is being performed more commonly in the hip joint to debride or repair tears of the acetabular labrum and also address femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging evaluation of the painful hip in adults&quot;, section on 'Femoroacetabular impingement'</a>). However, more studies are needed to clarify whether addressing labral tears <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> FAI arthroscopically can delay the onset of or prevent the progression of hip OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. There is preliminary evidence that arthroscopic debridement of the labrum in patients older than 45 has minimal benefit for pain and function and should be only be considered with caution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging evaluation of the painful hip in adults&quot;, section on 'Acetabular labral tears'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging evaluation of the painful hip in adults&quot;, section on 'Femoroacetabular impingement'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ARTHROSCOPIC ABRASION ARTHROPLASTY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arthroscopic abrasion arthroplasty, involving burring and drilling of sclerotic bone, has not been shown to be beneficial in the management of osteoarthritis (OA). The results are unpredictable, and the process often leads to worsening of symptoms. In one study, 50 percent of those undergoing abrasion arthroplasty required total knee replacement within three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ARTHROSCOPIC SYNOVECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No clinical trials have been performed that study the efficacy of arthroscopic synovectomy in patients with osteoarthritis (OA), and it is generally not recommended. It is sometimes used in patients with inflammatory arthritis and is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synovectomy for inflammatory arthritis of the knee&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H785276466\"><span class=\"h1\">AUTOLOGOUS CHONDROCYTE IMPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Replacing localized regions of degenerated cartilage with autologous chondrocyte grafts may be beneficial for selected patients with less severe, localized articular cartilage defects. However, patients should try other nonsurgical treatments before considering this procedure. Generally, the best candidates for this procedure have a focal cartilage defect involving only one side of the joint. It is unlikely that this technique will be helpful in patients with advanced joint degeneration because of the large surface area that needs grafting in this setting. Most patients who have received this treatment are younger people with chondral defects caused by trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The rationale for repairing cartilage defects is that they are thought to be associated with progression to osteoarthritis (OA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The formation of hyaline or hyaline-like cartilage may be induced by implanting autologous, cultured chondrocytes into the chondral or osteochondral defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The procedure is typically performed in two stages. First, an arthroscopy is performed and chondrocytes are harvested from a non-weightbearing part of the knee joint. The cells are then amplified in vitro and a second-stage procedure is performed to implant the cells protected by piece of periosteum sewn into the defect. A newer technique embeds the cells on a porcine matrix eliminating the need for the periosteal patch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. If there is an alignment issue (eg, varus or valgus deformity), this is typically corrected with an osteotomy to unload the cartilage repair. The procedure is generally followed by several months of rehabilitation.</p><p>There is an interest in using alternative sources of autologous chondrocytes with superior cartilage-forming capacity compared with articular chondrocytes. In a proof of concept, first-in-human trial, 10 patients with symptomatic, post-traumatic, full-thickness cartilage lesions on the femoral condyle or trochlea were treated with engineered tissue from autologous nasal cartilage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Significant improvements in pain, knee function, and quality of life were found during the 24-month follow-up period. These preliminary data will need further validation to establish efficacy and appropriateness of this approach for treating articular cartilage defects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H785276818\"><span class=\"h1\">OSTEOTOMY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H785276824\"><span class=\"h2\">Knee</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High tibial osteotomy for a varus knee and distal femoral osteotomy for a valgus knee continue to be viable options for younger, more active patients with predominantly unicompartmental disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-knee-arthroplasty#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Total knee arthroplasty&quot;, section on 'Osteotomy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H785276844\"><span class=\"h2\">Hip</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In select cases of hip developmental dysplasia, hip impingement, and other conditions with the absence of advanced degenerative disease, different types of osteotomies around the hip may be possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-hip-arthroplasty#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Total hip arthroplasty&quot;, section on 'Alternatives to total hip arthroplasty'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H785276638\"><span class=\"h1\">JOINT RESURFACING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Joint resurfacing, specifically hip joint resurfacing or hip resurfacing arthroplasty, is an alternative to total hip replacement. Hip resurfacing arthroplasty preserves the femoral neck and uses a metal prosthesis to replace the femoral head. A metal acetabular component is utilized to create a metal-on-metal bearing surface. Enthusiasm has diminished secondary to potential of adverse tissue reactions associated with metal-on-metal bearings. A more detailed discussion on total hip resurfacing is presented separately. This procedure has largely fallen out of favor secondary to concerns about the toxic effects of metal ions. It still is considered by some surgeons for use in highly active, young males in whom the results of total hip arthroplasty have been the most challenging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-hip-arthroplasty#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Total hip arthroplasty&quot;, section on 'Total hip resurfacing'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty#H21457382\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of total hip arthroplasty&quot;, section on 'Sequelae from metal-on-metal wearing debris'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H785276913\"><span class=\"h1\">UNICOMPARTMENTAL ARTHROPLASTY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the knee, unicompartmental arthroplasty is a viable alternative to total knee arthroplasty in cases with predominantly unicompartmental involvement. This is principally because of improved surgical techniques and implants. Generally, patients have a quicker recovery and improved range of motion compared with total knee arthroplasty. Unicompartmental arthroplasty is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-knee-arthroplasty#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Total knee arthroplasty&quot;, section on 'Unicompartmental knee replacement'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TOTAL JOINT ARTHROPLASTY (REPLACEMENT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total joint replacement surgery is an important option in patients with severe symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) who have failed to respond to nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management and who have significant impairment in their quality of life due to OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Total joint replacement is the most common definitive surgical procedure for endstage OA. It provides marked pain relief and functional improvement in patients with severe hip or knee OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. As an example, a randomized trial of 100 patients with moderate to severe OA found that after 12 months, treatment with total knee replacement followed by nonsurgical treatment resulted in greater pain relief and improvements in function and quality of life when compared with nonsurgical treatment alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, some patients in the nonsurgical treatment group also experienced clinically meaningful improvements, while the surgical group had a higher number of serious adverse events. Thus, some patients who appear ready for a total knee replacement may still improve with conservative therapy. It is important to individualize surgical decision-making with each patient, including an informed discussion of the risks and benefits.</p><p>A detailed discussion on total hip and knee arthroplasties are presented separately.
