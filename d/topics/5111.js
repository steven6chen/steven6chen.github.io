The extensive list of monikers for this condition reflects the debate regarding its neuroanatomic localization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-amyotrophy-and-idiopathic-lumbosacral-radiculoplexus-neuropathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Additional debate has been waged regarding which pathophysiologic mechanisms (eg, ischemic, metabolic [hyperglycemia], <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inflammatory) are responsible for diabetic amyotrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-amyotrophy-and-idiopathic-lumbosacral-radiculoplexus-neuropathy/abstract/3,10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10-14</a>]. However, the most likely cause is ischemic injury from a nonsystemic microvasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-amyotrophy-and-idiopathic-lumbosacral-radiculoplexus-neuropathy/abstract/10,11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,15</a>].

In a series of 33 patients with diabetic amyotrophy, nerve biopsy specimens showed features of multifocal fiber loss, perineurial thickening, neovascularization, and abortive regeneration of nerve fibers forming microfasciculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-amyotrophy-and-idiopathic-lumbosacral-radiculoplexus-neuropathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Teased fibers showed increased axonal degeneration, empty nerve strands, and segmental demyelination. Half of the biopsies showed inflammatory cells disrupting vessel walls.

The traditional features include the acute, asymmetric, focal onset of pain followed by weakness involving the proximal leg, with associated autonomic failure and weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-amyotrophy-and-idiopathic-lumbosacral-radiculoplexus-neuropathy/abstract/1-3,6,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,6,17</a>]. Progression occurs over months and is followed by partial to full recovery in most patients. However, onset in the distal leg is not uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-amyotrophy-and-idiopathic-lumbosacral-radiculoplexus-neuropathy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Furthermore, the condition becomes more widespread and symmetric with time. In nearly all cases, the symptoms and signs progress to affect the contralateral limb and the distal legs.</p><p>These points are illustrated by a prospectively studied series of 33 patients with diabetic amyotrophy. The following clinical observations were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-amyotrophy-and-idiopathic-lumbosacral-radiculoplexus-neuropathy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median age of the patients was 65 years (range 35 to 80), and the median duration of diabetes was 4 years (range 0 to 36).

Although data are scant, clinical experience suggests that the concurrent use of narcotic analgesics and agents for neuropathic pain is beneficial in the initial phase. Neuropathic pain treatments include tricyclic antidepressants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

In addition, it may involve cervical nerve roots, brachial plexus, or upper extremity nerves. The most likely cause of diabetic amyotrophy and the clinically similar condition of idiopathic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy is ischemic injury from a nonsystemic microvasculitis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetic amyotrophy typically occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The traditional features include the acute, asymmetric, focal onset of pain followed by weakness involving the proximal leg, with associated autonomic failure and weight loss. Progression occurs over months and is followed by partial recovery in most patients. However, onset in the distal leg is not uncommon. Furthermore, the condition becomes more widespread and symmetric with time. In nearly all cases, the symptoms and signs progress to affect the contralateral limb and the distal legs. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper limb and thoracic involvement has also been observed as part of the syndrome of diabetic amyotrophy. Symptoms and signs reflect involvement of cervical or thoracic nerve roots, brachial plexus, or upper extremity nerves. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Cervical and thoracic involvement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy is similar to diabetic amyotrophy with respect to its pathophysiology, clinical features, prognosis, and management. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Idiopathic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of diabetic amyotrophy is mainly based upon the presence of suggestive clinical features in a patient with known or newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. Appropriate laboratory investigations, particularly electrodiagnostic studies, and neuroimaging in select patients, are useful to exclude other peripheral and central nervous system etiologies as a cause of the neurologic symptoms and signs. In patients who do not have diabetes, idiopathic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy is the primary consideration in the differential diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While clinical improvement is the rule with diabetic amyotrophy and idiopathic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy, most patients do not recover completely. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No treatments are proven to be effective for diabetic amyotrophy or for idiopathic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy.
