Ultimately, however, disease progresses in almost all cases. Patients who progress while on ADT are termed castration resistant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=castration-resistant-prostate-cancer-treatments-targeting-the-androgen-pathway\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Castration-resistant prostate cancer: Treatments targeting the androgen pathway&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The use of the dendritic cell vaccine <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sipuleucel-t-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sipuleucel-T</a> and experimental immunotherapies for the management of castration-resistant prostate cancer will be reviewed here. An overview of the approach to systemic therapy, including the role of different treatment options for castration-resistant disease, is presented separately.

Examples include prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA).</p><p>The poor in vivo immune response to many tumors, including prostate cancer, has been attributed to evasion of immune system recognition by decreased immunogenicity of surface antigens or blunted effectiveness of the immune response mounted against them. Several approaches have been studied to circumvent defective presentation of antigen to effector cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> enhance the responsiveness of the patient's own immune system.

Dendritic cells, which can be harvested by leukapheresis, are efficient antigen-presenting cells that initiate an antigen-specific immune response via uptake, processing, and presentation of antigens to T cells. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sipuleucel-t-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sipuleucel-T</a>, a dendritic cell vaccine that induces immunity against PAP, can prolong overall survival and is commercially available.

These cells are exposed ex vivo to a novel recombinant protein immunogen (PA2024), which consists of PAP fused to human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). These activated cells are then infused back into the patient approximately three days after the original harvesting. Dendritic cell infusions are repeated for a total of three treatments at two-week intervals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon phase <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> results, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sipuleucel-t-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sipuleucel-T</a> was studied in three randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. In the first two trials, the primary endpoint was progression-free survival, and overall survival was a planned secondary endpoint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A subsequent, larger phase III trial was designed with overall survival as the primary endpoint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In all three trials, patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to sipuleucel-T or a placebo vaccine that consisted of mononuclear cells that had not been exposed to PA2024. Sipuleucel-T or the placebo was infused on weeks 0, 2, and 4.</p><p>The patient population in each trial consisted of men with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer. Inclusion criteria required radiologic evidence of metastasis, a serum testosterone &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL,</span> an expected survival of at least three months, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients with visceral metastases or requiring opioid analgesics were excluded. Patients being treated with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist at enrollment were continued on it during therapeutic vaccine treatment. Patients assigned to the placebo were allowed to cross over to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sipuleucel-t-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sipuleucel-T</a> if progressive disease developed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the initial two trials, progression-free survival was the primary endpoint. A combined analysis of the 225 men enrolled in these trials observed a statistically nonsignificant trend toward increased time to progression with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sipuleucel-t-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sipuleucel-T</a> compared with the control (11.1 versus 9.7 months, p = 0.11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although the increase in progression-free survival was not statistically significant, overall survival, a secondary endpoint, was significantly longer in the sipuleucel-T group compared with placebo (median 23.2 versus 18.9 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.91). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall survival was the primary endpoint in the phase III IMPACT trial, which enrolled 512 men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. At a median follow-up of 34 months, patients assigned to the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sipuleucel-t-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sipuleucel-T</a> therapeutic vaccine had significantly improved overall survival (median 25.8 versus 21.7 months, HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61-0.98). Differences in survival could not be accounted for by variations in subsequent treatment. As in the phase II trials, progression-free survival was not significantly prolonged (14.6 versus 14.4 weeks), and there were no significant differences in changes of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An immunologic assessment of patients in the IMPACT trial provided additional evidence of an effect from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sipuleucel-t-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sipuleucel-T</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Antibody titers against PA2024 antigen were significantly more frequent in those treated with sipuleucel-T (66 versus 3 percent), as were antibodies against PAP (29 versus 1.4 percent). In a prespecified analysis, survival was significantly longer in those with antibody responses to these antigens. T cell proliferation responses to PA2024 and PAP were more frequent in those treated with sipuleucel-T (73 versus 12 and 27 versus 8 percent, respectively); however, the development of a T cell response could not be correlated with a significant survival advantage.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sipuleucel-t-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sipuleucel-T</a> was generally well tolerated in all three randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Side effects were related to the infusion of the therapeutic vaccine, were mostly grade 1 or 2, and usually resolved within one to two days.</p><p>A combined analysis of the three trials compared the safety profile in 601 patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sipuleucel-t-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sipuleucel-T</a> with that of 303 treated with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Adverse events more common with sipuleucel-T included chills, fatigue, fever, nausea, and headache (53 versus 11, 41 versus 35, 31 versus 10, 21 versus 15, and 18 versus 7 percent, respectively, compared with placebo). Cerebrovascular events were reported in 3.5 percent of patients treated with sipuleucel-T and 2.4 percent of patients who received placebo.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Role in patient management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sipuleucel-t-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sipuleucel-T</a> therapeutic vaccine is an appropriate treatment option in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic men (performance status 0 or 1) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. There are no data in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer whose only evidence of disseminated disease is an elevated serum PSA (so called &quot;M0 CRPC&quot;) or in those with more advanced disease (visceral metastases, using steroids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> narcotics). </p><p>Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sipuleucel-t-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sipuleucel-T</a> significantly prolonged overall survival, it rarely induced disease regression and did not have a perceptible effect on radiographic progression-free survival. Furthermore, it did not induce consistent changes in serum PSA level. Whether this is due to a delayed effect of immunotherapy or whether some other mechanism is involved is unclear. The absence of objective parameters to judge whether or not an individual patient is benefiting from vaccine therapy poses a major difficulty in determining when to consider sipuleucel-T ineffective and initiate alternative treatment.</p><p>A number of other agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=abiraterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abiraterone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enzalutamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enzalutamide</a>, taxanes, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radium-223-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">radium-223</a>) have also demonstrated improvement in overall survival in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F85716\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85716 \">table 2</a>). The proper sequencing of agents is yet to be determined. Factors to consider when choosing systemic therapy for men with castration-resistant disease are discussed separately.

During cellular activation, various costimulatory signals act in concert with T cell antigen receptor binding to promote or restrict full T cell activation. These costimulatory signals may be inhibitory or activating. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of cancer immunotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3978632409\"><span class=\"h2\">Ipilimumab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the most important inhibitory costimulatory signals that restricts the T cell response to self-antigens is mediated through the cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 molecule (CTLA-4, also known as CD152) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Binding of CTLA-4 on a cytotoxic T cell to ligands on an antigen-presenting cell leads to T cell progeny that are less sensitive to stimulation by antigens. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ipilimumab</a>, a humanized anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody, binds to the CTLA-4 receptor on T cells and augments the immune response by blocking the interaction of CTLA-4 with the B7 receptor. Ipilimumab was approved based on its ability to significantly improve overall survival in patients with metastatic melanoma, and this led to its evaluation in other tumor types.</p><p>In men with castration-resistant prostate cancer, two phase III trials using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a> have failed to show any improvement in overall survival. In both trials, ipilimumab was given at a dose of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every three weeks for four cycles; responding patients were eligible to receive maintenance treatment once every three months in the absence of disease progression.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one trial, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a> was compared with placebo in 799 patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer who had received prior treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Overall survival, the primary endpoint of the trial, was not significantly increased compared with placebo (median 11.2 versus 10 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0.85, 95% CI 0.72-1.00, p = 0.053). Secondary analyses of overall survival observed an excess of early deaths with ipilimumab compared with placebo, and a relative decrease in the risk of death at later time points (HR before five months 1.46, 95% CI 1.10-1.95, HR from 5 to 12 months 0.65, 95% CI 0.50-0.85, and HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.43-0.86). Additional follow-up will be required to determine whether there is a durable survival benefit similar to that observed in patients treated with ipilimumab for advanced melanoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another trial, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a> was compared with placebo in 600 asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with metastatic prostate cancer who had progressed on hormonal therapy and who had not received prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Although progression-free survival was significantly longer with ipilimumab, there was no improvement in overall survival (the primary endpoint of the trial) with ipilimumab compared with placebo (median 28.7 versus 29.7 months, HR 1.11, 96% CI 0.88-1.39). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other approaches to stimulate a T cell response are under study in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer.
