This clone of plasma cells proliferates in the bone marrow and often results in extensive skeletal destruction with osteolytic lesions, osteopenia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pathologic fractures. Additional disease-related complications include hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, and infections. </p><p>This topic reviews the overall treatment strategy for patients with MM. Further details regarding the selection of initial therapy, the treatment of <span class=\"nowrap\">relapsed/refractory</span> disease, the use of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), and the management of complications of MM are discussed separately.

Unlike persons with MGUS and SMM, patients with MM require treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Without effective therapy, symptomatic patients die within a median of six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

For example, patients with MGUS can have renal failure due to unrelated disorders such as diabetes or hypertension, or may have bone lesions from other cancers. Therefore every effort should be made to determine whether the observed &quot;end-organ damage&quot; is truly secondary to the underlying plasma cell disorder and not another unrelated process.</p><p>All patients with MM as defined above need therapy. However, if there is doubt about whether the patient has SMM or MM, the most reasonable approach is to reevaluate the patient in two months and to delay therapy until the correct diagnosis is evident.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55652897\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation of patients with MM must establish the precise diagnosis, the extent and sites of disease, and the performance status of the patient. In addition, specific tests are performed for risk stratification and the determination of eligibility for autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Particular attention should be paid in the history and physical examination to the presence of co-morbid conditions in the patient that could complicate overall management. The history should also pay specific attention to complaints of bone pain, constitutional symptoms, neurological symptoms, and infections. The physical examination should include a detailed neurologic exam.</p><p>Our pretreatment evaluation also includes the following studies, some of which are performed as part of the diagnostic evaluation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A complete blood count and differential with examination of the peripheral blood smear. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chemistry screen that includes measurements of serum calcium, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, beta-2 microglobulin, and C-reactive protein.

This risk stratification impacts treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97453\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97453 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p>Prognosis in myeloma depends on several variables: host factors (age, performance status, co-morbidities), stage, response to therapy, and disease biology. Disease biology is dictated by the underlying cytogenetic abnormalities in the myeloma clone. It is a major predictor of outcome and also influences the choice of therapy. Thus, all myeloma patients are risk-stratified at initial diagnosis based on FISH studies on the bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. If FISH is unavailable, conventional cytogenetics can be used as an alternative but is much less sensitive.</p><p>We recommend that at least one of the following tests, preferably FISH, be performed to assess risk in all newly diagnosed patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FISH for detection of t(11;14), t(4;14), t(6;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), del17p13, 1q+, and trisomies of odd numbered chromosomes.

Patients with a high-risk signature on gene expression profiling are also considered to have high-risk MM, but this test is not recommended on a routine basis. There are conflicting data on whether the presence of trisomies in patients with high-risk cytogenetics can ameliorate some of the adverse prognostic effects of high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

When compared with chemotherapy alone, intensified chemotherapy followed by HCT appears to prolong both event-free and overall survival in previously untreated patients with standard-risk myeloma. The initial chemotherapy given to patients who are candidates for HCT should limit agents that may impair stem cell collection. Eligibility criteria are discussed in the following section. Practical issues regarding the use of autologous HCT in myeloma are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation in multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A minority of patients will be eligible for allogeneic HCT, but the role of allogeneic approaches in myeloma remains investigational and controversial.

Although the incidence of CR was lower in the older patients (20 versus 43 percent), age was not a predictor of worse outcomes; CR duration, event-free survival, and overall survival were comparable in the two groups.

This preference is based upon randomized trials, many of which have demonstrated superior survival with HCT, and the understanding that chemotherapy alone is not curative of MM and eligible patients will require a HCT at some point in their disease course. Treatment-related mortality with autologous HCT in the modern era is low. An analysis of autologous HCT in 1156 patients with MM reported a one-year non-relapse mortality of 2 percent (95% CI 1-4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

By comparison, many of the studies that did not show a survival benefit from HCT were relatively flawed since the results failed to distinguish survival with HCT for initial therapy from survival with HCT for relapsed disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/19,40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,40-44</a>].

Based on the data summarized below, we do not offer double autologous HCT to most patients with myeloma.

In addition, all patients up to the age of 55 who had matched-sibling donors were offered myeloablative allogeneic HCT. After an interim analysis, the option of allogeneic HCT was omitted for the remainder of the trial because 53 percent of the initial 36 patients who underwent allogeneic HCT died within the first three months. Among the 17 patients who underwent allogeneic HCT, progression-free and overall survival appear to plateau from 5 to 10 years with rates of 22 and 39 percent, respectively. This plateau suggests that a small percentage of patients undergoing allogeneic HCT may be cured.</p><p>Thus, although allogeneic HCT may be a potentially curative treatment for MM, initial treatment with high dose chemotherapy followed by allogeneic HCT is not commonly employed. This is due to many factors including the fact that a majority of patients are ineligible due to older age or comorbidities and because it is associated with high rates of overall mortality and symptoms of graft-versus-host disease. Moreover the higher probability of cure compared with autologous transplantation remains unproven. We do not recommend myeloablative allogeneic HCT at this time due to the excessively high mortality rate and toxicity and lack of proven benefit compared with autologous HCT. It may be considered, ideally in the context of a clinical trial, in exceptional cases where inadequate numbers of stem cells can be collected or the patient has both myeloma and another potential indication for HCT (eg, myelodysplastic syndrome).</p><p>Both prospective and retrospective studies have evaluated the use of <strong>nonmyeloablative</strong> HCT in MM. Nonmyeloablative HCT relies primarily on a graft-versus-myeloma effect, which is unfortunately often accompanied by the detrimental effects of graft-versus-host disease. Outcomes with this therapeutic approach have been mixed. Due to conflicting results, high treatment-related mortality, and toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT is not advised for patients with newly diagnosed myeloma outside of a clinical trial setting, except perhaps in those with high-risk prognostic factors.

After a median follow-up of 52 months, maintenance therapy resulted in improved PFS (median 32 versus 16 months, HR 0.47; 95% CI 0.40-0.56), second PFS (median 55 versus 40 months, HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.50-0.75), and overall survival (69 versus 60 percent alive at four years, HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.54-0.88). The improved second PFS suggests that the administration of maintenance therapy did not adversely impact the ability to respond to subsequent therapy. However, it is not clear whether all patients in the control arms had access to lenalidomide and bortezomib at the time of relapse. Toxicity and impact on quality of life were not examined.</p><p/><p>Until further data in support of maintenance therapy are reported, we suggest observation after the attainment of a plateau phase with treatment at the time of progression rather than the use of maintenance therapy in patients not eligible for HCT who are treated with a triplet regimen.

If clinical circumstances dictate the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a> to treat residual disease (such treatment is typically not considered maintenance), then the risk of second cancers must be discussed with the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55640417\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATING RESPONSE TO TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1364418840\"><span class=\"h2\">Response criteria and monitoring for relapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be evaluated before each treatment cycle to determine how their disease is responding to therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55362\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55362 \">table 7</a>).

Clinical relapse occurs when the patient develops CRAB symptoms (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, or new bone lesions). Relapsed disease can also be documented when there is a doubling of the monoclonal protein over two months, with an increase in the absolute levels of monoclonal protein of &ge;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in the serum or of &ge;500 mg per 24 hours in the urine, confirmed by two consecutive measurements.

Early trials have reported similar survival duration in patients with myeloma who have achieved disease stabilization (either with complete or partial response) following conventional melphalan-containing regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/71-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-74</a>]. In contrast, patients without any objective evidence of response have a relatively poor prognosis. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One series of 243 patients showed that the median survival was similar (42 to 43 months) in patients achieving an objective response, partial response (PR), or complete remission (CR), as well as those with a rapid tumor response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]; by comparison, the median survival was only 19 months in nonresponders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective analysis of 1555 patients treated in four SWOG chemotherapy trials confirmed the lack of prognostic significance of the initial response of the monoclonal protein as a predictor of overall or event-free survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

This was best shown in an ECOG study of 653 previously untreated patients who received treatment with VBMCP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, BCNU, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) alone, or with interferon alfa-2 or high-dose cyclophosphamide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Overall and complete responses were seen in 67 and 14 percent, respectively.

When compared with those who achieved a very good partial response (VGPR), patients who achieved a CR had significantly higher rates of progression-free (67 versus 27 percent) and overall (91 versus 70 percent) survival at three years. In comparison, patients who achieved a PR had rates of progression-free and overall survival at three years of 27 and 67 percent, respectively.</p><p>However, one must be careful when interpreting studies that show improved outcome in responders versus nonresponders (eg, CR versus no CR) since such comparisons have inherent methodologic flaws that cannot be overcome by increasing the sample size. In general, whether a treatment works or not, &quot;responders&quot; will typically appear to do better than &quot;nonresponders&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. One way of overcoming the bias that exists when comparing responders with nonresponders is to perform landmark analysis at time points that ensure that almost all patients have had time to reach the response level being studied. In studies that employed such landmark analysis (at 12, 18, and 24 months), CR appeared to improve survival only in the subset of approximately 15 percent of myeloma patients with high-risk disease, while in the remaining 85 percent overall survival was similar regardless of whether complete response was achieved or not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>Not all studies of novel agents have demonstrated a survival benefit with CR. As an example, an unplanned analysis examined the effect of response in the VISTA trial of MP with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a> as front-line therapy for myeloma in patients who are not candidates for transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. When compared with those who achieved a PR, patients who achieved a CR had superior time to progression (hazard ratio 0.50), time to next therapy (hazard ratio 0.58), and treatment-free interval (0.50). However, there was no improvement in overall survival for patients who achieved a CR versus those who achieved a PR (hazard ratio 0.89).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55654216\"><span class=\"h2\">Time to disease progression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More significant than the initial response to treatment is the time to disease progression. In a retrospective analysis of 1555 patients treated in four SWOG chemotherapy trials, overall survival for patients who experienced disease progression at 6 or 12 months was markedly shortened (13 to 15 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. It was concluded that survival duration was influenced more by the occurrence of progression than by the occurrence of response and that the best indicator of survival was time to first progression. On multivariate analysis, correlates of time to first progression included the following initial patient characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;150,000/microL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Albumin &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &gt;65 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta-2-microglobulin &gt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involvement of more than three bones</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span></p><p/><p>Many of these characteristics had previously been identified as poor prognostic features.

High-risk MM accounts for approximately 15 percent of patients and is associated with a median survival of approximately two to three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/13,14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,16</a>]. Patients with high-risk MM should be considered for novel therapeutic strategies (ie, early use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a> containing regimens) since they do poorly with all conventional treatment options. (See <a href=\"#H55652978\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification'</a> above.)</p><p>The goal of therapy in patients with high-risk myeloma is to achieve and sustain a complete response (CR). Unfortunately, patients with high-risk myeloma have an adverse outcome compared with standard-risk patients, even when HCT is employed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. The majority of patients with high-risk MM have an initial partial response to traditional chemotherapy followed by HCT or traditional chemotherapy alone. However, as shown in retrospective studies, high-risk patients relapse rapidly with a median progression-free survival of only 8 to 14 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/54,55,86-90\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55,86-90</a>]. This compares to an approximately 25-month median progression-free survival among all patients with MM treated with HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Thus, the benefit of HCT may be less in high-risk patients compared with standard-risk patients. The value of HCT in high-risk patients may be augmented by using post-HCT maintenance therapy to delay time to relapse. Alternatively, HCT can be used as a second-line option at the time of relapse. We routinely collect stem cells from high-risk patients who appear to be candidates for HCT after a few cycles of induction chemotherapy. The choice of initial therapy differs to some extent in high-risk disease between those who are candidates for HCT and those who are not. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-initial-chemotherapy-for-symptomatic-multiple-myeloma#H55641103\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of initial chemotherapy for symptomatic multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'High-risk myeloma'</a>.)</p><p>Most patients with MM demonstrate an overall survival benefit from obtaining either a CR or a very good partial response to therapy; overall survival benefits are seen even for patients who do not obtain a CR to therapy. However, among patients with high-risk MM, patients who achieve a CR have a longer overall survival than those who do not. This was demonstrated in a landmark survival analysis of 44 patients with high-risk myeloma defined by gene expression profiling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. This study demonstrated significantly higher rates of 24-month overall survival for those achieving a complete response compared with those who failed to achieve a complete response (approximately 80 versus 30 percent, respectively). Thus CR is a goal of therapy in high-risk patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55640429\"><span class=\"h1\">RELAPSED DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost all patients with MM who survive initial treatment will eventually relapse and require further therapy. Relapsed or refractory MM is usually identified on routine surveillance performed during treatment or after the completion of therapy. Treatment options for patients with relapsed or refractory MM include hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), a rechallenge of the previous chemotherapy regimen, or a trial of a new regimen. Factors used to determine the choice of therapy include a risk stratification of myeloma (ie, high- or standard-risk disease), prior treatments used, and the duration of response to these treatments. The treatment of relapsed or refractory MM is presented separately.

Clinical relapse occurs when the patient develops CRAB symptoms (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, or new bone lesions). Relapsed disease can also be documented when there is a doubling of the monoclonal protein over two months, with an increase in the absolute levels of monoclonal protein of &ge;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in the serum or of &ge;500 mg per 24 hours in the urine, confirmed by two consecutive measurements.

Although guidelines are provided, the decision on transplant eligibility should be made based on a risk-benefit assessment and the needs and wishes of the patient. Patients <strong>eligible</strong> for HCT receive induction therapy for two to four months prior to stem cell collection in order to reduce the number of tumor cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood, lessen symptoms, and mitigate end-organ damage. During this time, specific arrangements for the subsequent HCT can be made to ease the transition of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Determining transplant eligibility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Approach to therapy in</strong> <strong>standard- and intermediate-risk myeloma</strong> &ndash; Using information gathered from the risk stratification and HCT eligibility assessment, a general plan of care can be determined:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with standard or intermediate-risk MM who are candidates for HCT, we recommend the use of induction therapy for two to four months followed by autologous HCT rather than either conventional chemotherapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>) or myeloablative allogeneic HCT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest that patients proceed with their first HCT after recovery from stem cell collection (early transplant) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>), although survival may not be significantly different between early versus delayed HCT, particularly in patients with standard-risk myeloma. Timing of HCT is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation in multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Timing of HCT'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The preferred induction chemotherapy regimen depends on the risk stratification. The multiple treatment regimens available for these patient populations are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-initial-chemotherapy-for-symptomatic-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of initial chemotherapy for symptomatic multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients <strong>ineligible</strong> for HCT receiving induction <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> generally continue treatment until progression unless there is significant toxicity. In contrast, those receiving alkylator or bortezomib-based triplet regimen are treated for approximately 12 to 18 months and then observed until progression. (See <a href=\"#H55653311\" class=\"local\">'Duration of initial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>High-risk myeloma</strong> &ndash; Patients with high-risk MM should be encouraged to enroll in a clinical trial investigating novel therapeutic strategies, since they do poorly with all conventional treatment options. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-initial-chemotherapy-for-symptomatic-multiple-myeloma#H55641103\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of initial chemotherapy for symptomatic multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'High-risk myeloma'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complementary therapy</strong> &ndash; All patients with MM should be encouraged to be as active as possible in order to maintain bone density while avoiding activities with an excessive risk of trauma. Patients with one or more lesions on skeletal radiographs and those with osteopenia should be given bisphosphonate therapy, which significantly reduces the number of skeletal events. Pneumococcal and influenza vaccine should also be given to all patients. In addition, patients with MM frequently develop complications related to their disease, including hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, infection, and skeletal lesions, which require specific treatment in addition to therapy directed at the malignant clone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of osteoclast inhibitors in patients with multiple myeloma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-complications-of-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the complications of multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Evaluating response</strong> &ndash; Patients should be evaluated before each treatment cycle to determine how their disease is responding to therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55362\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55362 \">table 7</a>). Details on how to determine response to therapy are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluating response to treatment of multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Relapsed disease</strong> &ndash; Almost all patients with MM who survive initial treatment will eventually relapse and require further therapy. Relapsed or refractory MM is usually identified on routine surveillance performed during treatment or after the completion of therapy. Treatment options for patients with relapsed or refractory MM include HCT, a rechallenge of the previous chemotherapy regimen, or a trial of a new regimen.
