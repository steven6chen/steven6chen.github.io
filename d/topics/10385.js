Although advances in medical therapy have coincided with lower rates of surgical resection in patients with CD, surgical intervention is often required in the setting of bowel obstruction, abscesses or fistulas, or refractory disease. The 10-year risk of surgical resection for CD is nearly 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-crohn-disease-after-surgical-resection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>While surgery often leads to clinical remission of CD, most patients ultimately relapse. The risk and severity of recurrence after surgical resection is variable and needs to be balanced with the potential risk of preventative medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-crohn-disease-after-surgical-resection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the management of patients with CD following surgical resection. The American Gastroenterological Association has published guidelines on the management of CD after surgery, the contents of which are reflected in the subsequent discussions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-crohn-disease-after-surgical-resection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

In one report, three patients with CD who had undergone ileocolonic resection with ileocolonic anastomosis and temporary protective proximal loop ileostomy had no evidence of ileitis at six months after resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-crohn-disease-after-surgical-resection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, infusion of the ileostomy contents into the bypassed ileal segment for seven days resulted in morphologic evidence of focal inflammation on ileal biopsy. Thus, intestinal contents including bile salts, digestive enzymes, bacteria, and dietary antigens may trigger the postoperative recurrence of ileal CD within the first days after surgery. These findings suggest that in select patients, medical therapy should begin soon after resection, and ileocolonic anastomosis are performed and continue indefinitely.

Although clinical remission is often achieved, most patients eventually relapse. Recurrent disease can manifest by histologic or endoscopic findings or with clinical symptoms. Many patients will require subsequent surgery. (See <a href=\"#H2025966911\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative recurrence rates'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of risk factors for recurrence can help determine if the patient should begin medical therapy soon after surgery or if the patient can be monitored for disease recurrence. Smoking is a modifiable patient-related risk factor. Examples of disease-related risk factors for recurrence are a shorter disease duration prior to the initial operation, history of surgery for Crohn disease and penetrating or fistulizing disease. (See <a href=\"#H3876409795\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopic recurrence precedes clinical recurrence, providing an opportunity for medical intervention prior to development of symptoms or complications. We recommend an ileocolonoscopy 6 to 12 months following surgery in all patients, including those who are receiving postoperative medical therapy. (See <a href=\"#H5501051\" class=\"local\">'Ileocolonoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For lower risk patients, we suggest a three month course of imidazole antibiotic therapy (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). An alternative approach is to monitor lower risk patients clinically without prophylactic medical therapy initially, particularly in the setting of intolerance to metronidazole. <br/><br/>We suggest against immunosuppressive prophylaxis in lower risk patients pending evidence of recurrence on follow-up monitoring (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3772650234\" class=\"local\">'Lower risk patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For higher risk patients, we suggest immunosuppressive prophylaxis after surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Postoperative therapy with an anti-TNF agent or <span class=\"nowrap\">AZA/6-MP</span> reduces the risk of both clinical and endoscopic recurrence. The risk of adverse effects must be weighed against the potential benefits of anti-TNF therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2527583845\" class=\"local\">'Anti-tumor necrosis factor agents'</a> above.)<br/><br/>We suggest that higher risk, treatment naive patients begin <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or 6-MP <span class=\"nowrap\">(AZA/6-MP)</span> within eight weeks following bowel resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For higher risk patients who had been previously treated with either <span class=\"nowrap\">AZA/6-MP</span> or an anti-TNF, we suggest an anti-TNF agent is started within eight weeks postoperatively (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4293300700\" class=\"local\">'Higher risk patients'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine health maintenance in the postoperative setting includes screening for other diseases and monitoring for side effects of therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. All patients with Crohn disease who use tobacco should receiving counseling in smoking cessation.
