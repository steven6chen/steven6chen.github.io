Terms such as &quot;abscessus in medulla,&quot; &quot;necrosis,&quot; and &quot;a boil of the bone marrow&quot; were used to describe the infection until N&eacute;laton introduced the term &quot;osteomyelitis&quot; in 1844.</p><p>In the pre-antibiotic era, the management of acute osteomyelitis was purely surgical, with large incisions for removal of all necrotic bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Wounds were packed with Vaseline gauze and left to heal by secondary intention after immobilization. Mortality rates remained high (about 33 percent) due to sepsis until the introduction of penicillin in 1940, which dramatically changed the treatment and prognosis of osteomyelitis. Complications such as sequestration, sinus formation, and sepsis became less common, and the goals of therapy changed from disease containment to cure.</p><p>Issues related to epidemiology, pathophysiology, classification, microbiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of osteomyelitis are presented here. Issues related to diabetic foot infections as well as osteomyelitis in the setting of trauma, vertebral osteomyelitis, and hematogenous osteomyelitis are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of diabetic infections of the lower extremities&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of osteomyelitis following trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vertebral osteomyelitis and discitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteomyelitis can occur as a result of hematogenous seeding, contiguous spread of infection to bone from adjacent soft tissues and joints, or direct inoculation of infection into the bone as a result of trauma or surgery. Hematogenous osteomyelitis is usually monomicrobial, while osteomyelitis due to contiguous spread or direct inoculation is usually polymicrobial.</p><p>In long-bone hematogenous osteomyelitis, the most common site of infection is in the metaphysis. The major blood vessel to long bones usually penetrates the midshaft of the bone and then travels toward both ends, forming metaphyseal vascular loops just before it hits the epiphyseal plates. Slowed blood flow in these loops (together with the absence of basement membranes) predisposes this site to osteomyelitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the setting of osteomyelitis, inflammatory exudate in the marrow leads to increased intramedullary pressure, with subsequent extension of exudate into the bone cortex where it can rupture through the periosteum. If this occurs, the periosteal blood supply is interrupted, leading to necrosis. The resulting pieces of separated dead bone (known as sequestra) can be visualized radiographically. New bone formation that forms in areas of periosteal damage is known as an involucrum. In some cases, a sequestrum can evolve into an involucrum as it is encased with new bone growth. Occasionally, pus may exist in an opening (cloaca) of involucrum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to imaging modalities in the setting of suspected osteomyelitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute osteomyelitis is infection in bone prior to development of sequestra. In some forms of infection, development of sequestra is relatively slow (such as vertebral osteomyelitis), while in others the development of sequestra occurs relatively rapidly (such as osteomyelitis in the setting of prosthetic devices or compound fractures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Following formation of sequestra, the infection is considered chronic osteomyelitis; other hallmarks of chronic osteomyelitis include formation of an involucrum, local bone loss, and sinus tracts (if there is extension of infection through cortical bone).</p><p>In the setting of vertebral osteomyelitis, two endplates of neighboring vertebra are frequently involved in the infection. This observation can be explained by the blood supply anatomy; one arterial vessel splits to supply the neighboring endplates of two vertebra. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vertebral osteomyelitis and discitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Issues related to bacterial adherence, host defense mechanisms, and histopathology are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of osteomyelitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4181597992\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two major osteomyelitis classification schemes: one described by Lew and Waldvogel and another described by Cierny and Mader [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Lew and Waldvogel classified osteomyelitis based on the duration of illness (acute versus chronic) and the mechanism of infection (hematogenous or secondary to a contiguous focus of infection). Contiguous infection may be further subdivided depending upon whether vascular insufficiency is present. This scheme is an etiologic classification and does not imply a specific therapeutic strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Cierny and Mader classified long-bone osteomyelitis based on the affected portion of the bone, the physiologic status of the host, and the local environment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64015\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64015 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This classification lends itself to the treatment and prognosis of osteomyelitis; stage 1 (medullary osteomyelitis) can usually be treated with antibiotics alone, while stages 2, 3, and 4 (superficial, localized, and diffuse osteomyelitis) usually require aggressive debridement, antimicrobial therapy, and subsequent orthopedic reconstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematogenous osteomyelitis is usually monomicrobial, while contiguous osteomyelitis may be either polymicrobial or monomicrobial. <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and aerobic gram-negative bacilli are the most common organisms; other pathogens including streptococci, enterococci, anaerobes, fungi, and mycobacteria have also been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/3,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1151559124\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematogenous osteomyelitis occurs more commonly in children than adults; in children, long bones are most often affected, while in adults the vertebrae are the most common site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Contiguous osteomyelitis tends to occur in younger individuals in the setting of trauma and related surgery, and, in older adults, secondary to decubitus ulcers and infected total joint arthroplasties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Osteomyelitis associated with vascular insufficiency usually occurs among individuals with diabetes mellitus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteomyelitis can occur as a result of contiguous spread of infection to bone from adjacent soft tissues and joints, hematogenous seeding, or direct inoculation of infection into the bone as a result of trauma or surgery. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H775299126\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute osteomyelitis typically presents with gradual onset of symptoms over several days. Patients usually present with dull pain at the involved site, with or without movement. Local findings (tenderness, warmth, erythema, and swelling) and systemic symptoms (fever, rigors) may also be present. However, patients with osteomyelitis involving sites such as the hip, vertebrae, or pelvis tend to manifest few signs or symptoms other than pain. Subacute osteomyelitis generally presents with mild pain over several weeks, with minimal fever and few constitutional symptoms.</p><p>Acute osteomyelitis can also present as septic arthritis. As noted above, in long-bone hematogenous osteomyelitis, the most common site of infection is in the metaphysis. If infection spreading from the metaphysis breaks through the bone cortex within the capsular reflection of a joint, discharge of pus into the joint presents as a septic arthritis secondary to osteomyelitis. Joints in which the long-bone metaphysis is within the joint capsular reflection include the knee, hip, and shoulder. This is particularly important in infants, for whom the presence of transphyseal blood vessels and an immature growth plate allows early spread of bacteria from the metaphysis to the epiphysis of the bone and into the joint cavity. In these cases, infection that begins in the bone can spread into the joint quickly, leading to septic arthritis.</p><p>Chronic osteomyelitis may present with pain, erythema, or swelling, sometimes in association with a draining sinus tract. The presence of a sinus tract is pathognomic of chronic osteomyelitis. The diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis can be particularly challenging when prosthetic material, extensive skin or soft tissue ulceration, or ischemic changes due to vascular insufficiency are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Deep or extensive ulcers that fail to heal after several weeks of appropriate ulcer care should raise suspicion for chronic osteomyelitis, particularly when such lesions overlie bony prominences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Additional presentations of chronic osteomyelitis include nonhealing fractures and Brodie's abscess (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of diabetic foot ulcers&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Brodie's abscess'</a>).</p><p>Diabetic patients with chronic osteomyelitis may present with atypical physical findings. Diabetics who develop cutaneous ulcers often develop osteomyelitis before exposed bone is present on exam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. If a diabetic foot ulcer is larger than 2 x 2 cm or if exposed bone is present, osteomyelitis is highly likely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of diabetic infections of the lower extremities&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Probing to bone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probing for bone with a sterile blunt metal tool should be included in the initial assessment of all diabetic patients with infected pedal ulcers. A positive result consists of detection of a hard, gritty surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. The reliability of the probe-to-bone test may vary by the ulcer location and the expertise of the clinician performing the test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The probe-to-bone test should be used as a screening tool in conjunction with the patient's pre-test probability for osteomyelitis to determine whether additional diagnostic tests (such as radiographic imaging or bone biopsy) are needed for therapeutic decisions. The performance characteristics of the probe-to-bone test have been evaluated in the setting of diabetic foot ulcers; in practice, the test is also used for evaluating nondiabetic ulcers due to peripheral neuropathy, vasculopathy, or pressure sores.</p><p>In a systematic review evaluating the performance of the probe-to-bone test (using bone histopathology or culture as the reference standard), the pooled sensitivity and specificity for the test were 0.87 (95% CI 0.65-0.93) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.65-0.93), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. An important limitation was the potential for selection and verification bias; the studies included in the analysis did not explicitly mention whether the results of the probe-to-bone test influenced pursuit of bone biopsy or culture nor whether interpreters of the reference standard were blinded to results of the probe-to-bone test.</p><p>The probe-to-bone test may be used in a high-prevalence settings (such as the emergency department or inpatient hospital ward) as a screening test or in a low-risk setting (such as outpatient primary care clinic) to rule out diabetic foot osteomyelitis. As the prevalence of diabetic foot osteomyelitis increases, the sensitivity of the test increases and the specificity of the test decreases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9469200\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory tests are usually nonspecific. Leukocytosis may be observed in the setting of acute osteomyelitis but is unlikely in the setting of chronic osteomyelitis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> C-reactive protein are usually elevated but may be normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Blood cultures may be positive in about half of cases of acute osteomyelitis; their utility may be highest in the setting of hematogenous infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Blood cultures are also more likely to be positive in vertebral disease and when hematogenous osteomyelitis involves locations such at the clavicle or pubis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Positive blood cultures may obviate the need for invasive diagnostic testing if the organism isolated from blood is a pathogen likely to cause osteomyelitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute osteomyelitis should be suspected in bacteremic patients at risk of seeding vertebrae, long bones, and bone and joint prostheses in cases of open fractures or recent surgery. Chronic osteomyelitis should be suspected in patients with chronic, poorly healing soft tissue wounds, in the setting of diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, decubitus ulcers, or in the presence of underlying hardware.</p><p>The diagnosis of osteomyelitis is established via culture of bacteria from a bone biopsy obtained via sterile technique, together with histologic findings of inflammation and osteonecrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Bone biopsy may not be needed for patients with radiographic studies consistent with osteomyelitis in the setting of positive blood cultures. Laboratory findings are nonspecific and may include leukocytosis and elevated serum inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> C-reactive protein [CRP]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Establishing an accurate diagnosis of osteomyelitis is critical, since the infection can require prolonged antibiotic therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aggressive surgical intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9469335\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial evaluation of patients with suspected osteomyelitis includes history and physical examination; predisposing factors or events should be elicited (such as underlying diabetes, vasculopathy, invasive procedures, injection drug use, and other predisposing factors). The probe-to-bone test should be used as a screening tool in conjunction with the patient's pre-test probability for osteomyelitis to determine whether additional diagnostic tests (such as radiographic imaging or bone biopsy) are needed for therapeutic decisions.</p><p>If osteomyelitis is suspected based on clinical history and physical findings, plain radiographs of the involved area should be obtained along with laboratory evaluation (including ESR, CRP, white blood cell count, and blood cultures; the yield of blood cultures is likely highest in the setting of associated fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in the setting of suspected vertebral osteomyelitis).</p><p>If plain radiographs are normal or have findings suggestive of osteomyelitis without characteristic features, a more sophisticated imaging modality should be pursued in the clinical setting of risk factors (such as diabetes, localized symptoms, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an elevated ESR). The optimal modality may depend upon specific clinical circumstances and should be tailored accordingly for individual patients, in discussion with radiologist expertise if necessary. The following concepts may help guide selection of radiographic modality (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to imaging modalities in the setting of suspected osteomyelitis&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient is diabetic and has symptoms referable to the foot, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the test of choice.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient has symptoms referable to the spine, MRI is the test of choice to evaluate for vertebral osteomyelitis. If MRI is not available, computed tomography (CT) is the alternative test of choice.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If metal hardware precludes MRI or CT, a nuclear study is the test of choice. The limitations of nuclear studies are discussed separately and should be considered in interpretation of results.</p><p/><p>Findings of osteomyelitis on radiographic imaging should prompt bone biopsy for culture to confirm the diagnosis and to guide antimicrobial therapy, unless blood cultures are positive for a likely pathogen (such as <em>S. aureus</em>, a gram-negative enteric rod, or <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>). Osteomyelitis is unlikely in the absence of radiographic evidence on MRI, CT, or nuclear imaging.</p><p>If blood cultures and needle aspirate cultures are negative and the clinical suspicion for osteomyelitis remains high on the basis of clinical and radiographic findings, repeat bone biopsy (either percutaneous or open) should be performed. If this specimen is also nondiagnostic, an empiric antimicrobial regimen should be initiated against common gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58877\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58877 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>If there is evidence of soft tissue infection over a bony surface without radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis, an empiric course of therapy for soft tissue infection may be appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone biopsy (open or percutaneous) should be obtained for pathogen identification and to obtain susceptibility data when this is feasible; biopsy is also useful if the diagnosis of osteomyelitis is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>]. Cultures of bone biopsy material yield positive findings in up to 87 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Cultures of swabs or material from needle puncture (eg, aspiration of material adjacent to the periosteum rather than bone) should not be used to establish an osteomyelitis pathogen, since the correlation between bone biopsy culture and these specimens is poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Cessation of antibiotics 48 to 72 hours prior to bone biopsy may increase the microbiological yield, but often bone cultures are positive regardless of prior antibiotic therapy because such infections occur in areas of simultaneous infection-induced bony infarction or ischemia.</p><p>Open biopsy is preferable over needle biopsy. In circumstances where surgical debridement is required (such as decubitus ulcers or wounds with compromised vasculature), bone samples should be obtained at the time of surgical debridement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Percutaneous needle biopsy is an alternative to open biopsy, although this technique is less reliable than open biopsy given problems with sampling error. This was illustrated in a study including 31 diabetic patients in which culture results from needle biopsies were compared with open biopsies; needle biopsy had a lower yield than open biopsy, and the correlation between culture results obtained by needle biopsy and open biopsy was only 23 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, the sensitivity of needle biopsy can be particularly low in postoperative or posttraumatic settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/23,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,29</a>]. If the clinical suspicion for osteomyelitis is high in the setting of negative cultures from blood and needle biopsy, the needle biopsy should be repeated or an open biopsy performed.</p><p>Percutaneous procedures should be performed through intact tissues (rather than inflamed or ulcerated skin) to obtain accurate culture results. Fluoroscopic or computed tomography guidance for percutaneous procedures is preferable. Ideally, the biopsy should be obtained prior to treatment with antimicrobial therapy. At least two specimens should be obtained so that one can be sent for Gram stain and culture (including aerobic anaerobic, mycobacterial, and fungal studies) and the other for histopathology.</p><p>Bone biopsy may not be needed for patients with radiolographic studies consistent with osteomyelitis in the setting of positive blood cultures or when prior bone cultures have been obtained in a patient with clear evidence for relapse of prior bone infection. In addition, it may be impractical to obtain a bone biopsy in some circumstances since the biopsy site may heal poorly in the setting of advanced vascular disease. In such cases, empiric management should be pursued.

Although sinus tract cultures may be of some use for prediction of osteomyelitis if <em>S. aureus</em> or <em>Salmonella </em>spp are identified, in general, such cultures are not worthwhile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In one report of 40 patients with chronic osteomyelitis, only 44 percent of sinus tract cultures contained the pathogen isolated from a deep surgical specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Isolation of <em>S. aureus</em> from the sinus tract culture had some predictive value, although the absence of <em>S. aureus</em> in the sinus tract did not preclude its presence on bone biopsy. Culturing other organisms is not predictive for those that will be found on bone biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Sonication of explanted hardware may be useful to detect microorganisms that are highly adherent to fixation hardware, although this procedure is not routinely available in most microbiology laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/21,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,34,35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histopathologic features of osteomyelitis include necrotic bone with extensive resorption adjacent to an inflammatory exudate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Probing to bone is sufficient for diagnosis of osteomyelitis. In general, it is prudent to pursue imaging for assessment of bone involvement in the setting of chronic soft tissue infection that fails to improve with appropriate antibiotic therapy; this occurs more often in the setting of diabetes.

Furthermore, patients with Charcot arthropathy commonly develop skin ulcerations that can in turn lead to secondary osteomyelitis. Bone scans, plain radiographs, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in patients with acute or chronic neuroarthropathy may be indistinguishable from patients with acute osteomyelitis. However, contrast-enhanced MRI may be diagnostically useful if it shows a sinus tract, replacement of soft tissue fat, a fluid collection, or extensive marrow abnormalities. Bone biopsy may be needed in the preceding situations and in cases of presumed acute Charcot arthropathy in which rest, immobilization, and elevation do not result in improvement.

An integrated diagnostic approach incorporating the various diagnostic tools is outlined in detail above. (See <a href=\"#H9469335\" class=\"local\">'Clinical approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The reference standard for diagnosis of osteomyelitis is isolation of bacteria from a bone biopsy sample obtained via sterile technique, together with histologic findings of inflammation and osteonecrosis. Bone biopsy may not be needed for patients with radiologic studies consistent with osteomyelitis in the setting of positive blood cultures. Cultures obtained from sinus tract drainage are not reliable. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open biopsy is preferable over needle biopsy; bone samples should be obtained at the time of surgical debridement if performed. Percutaneous needle biopsy is an alternative to open biopsy; ideally, it should be performed via intact tissues and under radiographic guidance to optimize yield. Bone biopsy should be obtained prior to treatment with antimicrobial therapy whenever possible. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Bone biopsy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Cultures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leukocytosis may be observed in the setting of acute osteomyelitis but is less common in the setting of chronic osteomyelitis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> C-reactive protein are usually elevated but may be normal. Blood cultures are most likely to be positive in the setting of hematogenous infection and vertebral disease; positive blood cultures may obviate the need for invasive diagnostic testing. (See <a href=\"#H9469200\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of osteomyelitis often requires both surgical debridement of necrotic material and antimicrobial therapy for eradication of infection. The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy is not certain; we suggest continuing parenteral antimicrobial therapy at least six weeks from the last debridement (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Suggested antibiotic regimens are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58877\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58877 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of osteomyelitis consists of debridement and antimicrobial therapy. For treatment of methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> osteomyelitis, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>); <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daptomycin</a> is an acceptable alternative agent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F110257\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110257 \">table 4</a>). In the setting of prosthetic material and for cases of osteomyelitis in which therapeutic options are limited, we suggest adjunctive use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> for treatment of <em>S. aureus</em> osteomyelitis (in combination with at least one other anti-staphylococcal agent) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Use of rifampin must be weighed against the likelihood of toxicity and drug interactions. (See <a href=\"#H1293548527\" class=\"local\">'Infection due to S. aureus'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lew DP, Waldvogel FA.
