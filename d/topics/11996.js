The energy produced by physical activity is a component of energy balance that is particularly important in the pathogenesis of obesity and in its treatment. The components of energy expenditure are resting metabolic rate (RMR), the thermic effect of feeding (TEF), and physical activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F80202\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80202 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The initial management of overweight and obesity includes a combination of diet, exercise, and behavioral modification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Some patients may eventually require pharmacologic therapy or bariatric surgery to augment weight loss and weight loss maintenance. Physical exercise and activity are also important for maintaining long-term weight loss and are key in preserving lean body mass while dieting. A dose-response relationship has been demonstrated in overweight adult women between the amount of exercise and long-term weight loss maintenance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The role of physical activity in the prevention and treatment of obesity will be reviewed here.

This is important because subjects with abdominal obesity are at increased cardiovascular risk.

The value of exercise for reducing cardiovascular risk can be illustrated by the findings from a meta-analysis of 33 cohort studies evaluating the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and all-cause mortality or coronary heart disease (CHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Compared with patients with a high or an intermediate level of cardiorespiratory fitness, those with a low level had a higher risk for all-cause mortality (relative risk [RR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-1.9, low versus high) and for CHD events (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8, low versus high).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similarly, in a systematic review of 36 studies, the risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was higher in individuals with normal body mass index (BMI) and poor fitness than in those with high BMI and good aerobic fitness, even after adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p>Thus, adiposity and fitness level are important prognostic factors in obese individuals.

Low levels of physical activity and recreation are related to weight gain in both men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Maintaining adequate physical activity reduces the risk of weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>] and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. As an example, in young adults transitioning to middle age, higher compared with lower levels of physical activity over 20 years were associated with smaller gains in weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In this young (mean age 25 years), normal-weight population, 150 minutes of moderate activity per week was adequate to prevent weight gain.</p><p>In older or obese adults, however, higher activity levels may be necessary for prevention of weight gain. In a cohort of over 34,000 women (mean age 54.2 years) who were consuming a usual diet and were followed for a mean of 13 years, there was a mean weight gain of 2.6 kg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Compared with women who engaged in &gt;420 <span class=\"nowrap\">min/week</span> of exercise, women who engaged in &lt;150 and 150 to &lt;420 <span class=\"nowrap\">min/week</span> gained significantly more weight (0.12 and 0.11 kg, respectively). Physical activity was inversely related to weight gain only among normal-weight (body mass index [BMI] &lt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> women. Thus, in order to maintain normal body weight in the midlife, higher levels of physical activity (approximately 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">minutes/day)</span> were necessary. Once overweight, physical activity in the absence of controlling caloric intake did not prevent weight gain. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Exercise as a single treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>In a 12-month, randomized trial, men and women (mean age 55 years, mean BMI 29 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> who were randomly assigned to a moderate-to-vigorous exercise intervention (60-minute session six <span class=\"nowrap\">days/week)</span> were better able to maintain their weight than controls (-1.4 versus +0.7 kg for women, -1.8 versus -0.1 kg for men) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Exercisers also had significant decreases in waist and hip circumferences, fat mass, and percentage body fat. After 12 months, those in the intervention group were exercising a mean of 298 <span class=\"nowrap\">min/week</span> compared with 68 <span class=\"nowrap\">min/week</span> in the control group. These results suggest that in older individuals (particularly women), more than 68 min per week and perhaps at least 300 min of <span class=\"nowrap\">exercise/week</span> may be necessary to prevent long-term weight gain.</p><p>The contribution of physical activity interacts with genetic factors in the prevention of obesity. A meta-analysis of 45 studies in adults evaluating the interaction between physical activity and genetic risk for obesity showed that the risk of obesity in patients with <em>FTO</em> variants (associated with higher BMI and waist circumference) was attenuated by physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. These findings suggest that physical activity is likely to protect against obesity regardless of an individual's genetic predisposition to it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT FOR OBESITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise has been evaluated as a single treatment for obesity, in combination with diet, and for maintaining weight loss after successful completion of a weight loss program. In most studies, exercise only modestly improves weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. The reasons for this finding are uncertain but may be due, in part, to difficulty in adhering to sufficiently vigorous exercise regimens. In addition, for patients who are adherent with exercise training, increases in muscle mass, plasma volume, and glycogen stores may offset loss of adipose tissue, resulting in less net weight loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise as a single treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have evaluated the effect of exercise alone in inducing weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In meta-analyses of trials (duration 12 weeks to 12 months) examining the effects of exercise on weight loss, exercise resulted in modest reductions in weight compared with no treatment (weighted mean difference -1.6 kg) across all studies, which was comparable when comparing high- versus low-intensity exercise (mean difference -1.5 kg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In addition, exercise modestly decreased waist circumference and blood pressure.</p><p>While it may be difficult to lose weight with exercise alone, exercise appears to have a beneficial effect on reducing body fat. In a 12-week study on change in body composition and insulin resistance in 52 men who lost an average of 7.5 kg with either diet- or exercise-induced weight loss, the main findings were as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A greater reduction in total body fat in the exercise-induced weight loss group</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar reductions in abdominal obesity, visceral fat, and insulin resistance in the two treatment groups</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a third treatment group assigned to exercise without weight loss (increased caloric intake to match energy expenditure), abdominal and visceral fat was decreased but to a lesser degree than in the other treatment groups</p><p/><p>Exercise also has beneficial effects on body composition in premenopausal and postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In a randomized, 12-month trial in postmenopausal women of moderate-intensity exercise (most commonly brisk walking for an average of three hours per week) versus a control group with only a stretching program, the exercise group lost more weight (mean difference -1.4 kg) and had greater decreases in body fat, intraabdominal fat, and subcutaneous fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise plus diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise programs added to diets with moderate-to-severe caloric restriction have little additional effect upon weight loss. As an example, a systematic review of 17 randomized trials in overweight and obese patients (body mass index [BMI] 25 to 37 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> showed that compared with weight loss by diet alone, adding exercise to diet produced slightly greater weight loss than diet alone (mean increase in weight loss approximately 1.5 kg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, the results were statistically significant in only two of the trials. The exercise interventions ranged from 60 to 240 <span class=\"nowrap\">minutes/week</span>. Similar findings were subsequently reported in obese older adults (mean age 70 years) who were randomly assigned to diet or exercise alone, diet plus exercise, or control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Body weight decreased similarly in the diet alone and the diet plus exercise groups (10 and 9 percent, respectively) but did not decrease in the exercise alone or control groups. However, physical functioning improved significantly in all treatment groups compared with controls, and the improvement was greatest in the combined diet plus exercise group (increase from baseline of 21 versus 12 and 15 percent for diet and exercise alone, respectively).</p><p>The frequency and intensity of exercise may explain why exercise does not improve weight loss above that achieved with calorie restriction. If a patient utilizes 100 calories during exercise each day (700 calories per week), it would take five weeks to utilize the energy (3500 calories) in one pound of fat. Thus, it takes a considerable amount of time and effort to expend calories via physical activity that results in noticeable weight loss. In trials that were designed to assess higher intensity or longer duration of exercise (up to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">min/week),</span> the following findings were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 12-month trial of 184 overweight, sedentary women (mean BMI 32.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> who were randomly assigned to one of four exercise programs (ie, low <span class=\"nowrap\">intensity/low</span> duration, high <span class=\"nowrap\">intensity/low</span> duration, low <span class=\"nowrap\">intensity/high</span> duration, high <span class=\"nowrap\">intensity/high</span> duration), in addition to caloric restriction, weight loss was the same in all groups, regardless of exercise intensity or duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The mean achieved duration of exercise in the highest duration groups was approximately 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">min/week</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 12-month trial of 130 severely obese adults (mean BMI 43.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> who were randomly assigned to immediate or delayed physical activity in addition to caloric restriction, the initial activity group lost significantly more weight in the first six months than the delayed-activity group (10.9 versus 8.2 kg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. After 12 months, at which time both groups were participating in an exercise program, the magnitude of weight loss did not significantly differ between the two groups (12.1 versus 9.9 kg). The addition of physical activity resulted in greater reductions in waist circumference and hepatic fat content.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This trial was limited by high attrition rates (20 to 25 percent) and difficulty in achieving the desired exercise duration (300 <span class=\"nowrap\">min/week)</span>. Rather, the mean achieved duration of vigorous physical activity was only 71 <span class=\"nowrap\">min/week</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4208277876\"><span class=\"h2\">Aerobic or resistance exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obesity is a particular problem in older adults as it worsens the age-associated decline in function and frailty.

It appears that the addition of exercise to weight loss programs can help prevent the reduction in muscle and bone mass induced by weight loss, but the type of exercise is important. In one clinical trial of 160 obese adults in a six-month weight loss program, combined aerobic and resistance training improved functional status more than either type of exercise alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H163060392\"><span class=\"h2\">Addition of &quot;activity trackers&quot;</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wearable devices that monitor and provide feedback on physical activity and diet do not appear to provide additional benefit over standard behavioral weight loss interventions. In a trial of 470 overweight or obese adults, subjects were randomized to a standard intervention (self-monitoring of diet and exercise) or an enhanced intervention (use of a wearable device with a web interface to monitor diet and physical activity). After 24 months, both groups had similar improvements in body composition, fitness, physical activity, and diet, but the addition of a wearable device resulted in less weight loss than the standard behavioral weight loss program (3.5 versus 5.9 kg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>In a second trial of 800 subjects ages 21 to 65 years, the use of activity trackers for six months (either alone or with incentives [cash or charitable donations]) did not improve health outcomes (weight and blood pressure) when compared with a control group (no tracker or incentives) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintenance of weight loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In observational studies, exercise consistently stands out as an important factor in maintaining weight loss after any weight reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/9,23,45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,23,45-47</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 493 studies (observational studies and randomized trials) involving aerobic exercise for short durations (average 15.6 weeks), diet, or a combination of both in moderately overweight subjects (average BMI 33.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> with an average weight of 92.7 kg), the diet-and-exercise group maintained 8.6 kg of weight loss after one year compared with 6.6 kg in the diet-only group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Similarly, in a prospective study of weight maintenance in over 4500 premenopausal women, women who maintained &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">minutes/day</span> of activity were less likely to regain weight than women who remained sedentary (odds ratio [OR] 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>In contrast, results from randomized trials are mixed, but the majority (8 of 12) show no significant difference in weight regain for diet only versus diet plus exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The reason for this is unclear since epidemiologic, cross-sectional, and prospective correlational studies repeatedly suggest an essential role for physical activity in weight loss maintenance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In many of the randomized trials, participants had difficulty adhering to the exercise regimens, a limitation that may explain, in part, the difference in the findings. Other limitations include variability in the amount and duration of exercise prescribed. In one systematic review of observational and randomized trial data, weight regain was reduced by participation in high levels of physical activity (eg, at least 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">minutes/day</span> brisk walking), a level not achieved by most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Post-hoc analysis of randomized trials shows a clear dose-response relationship between physical activity and weight loss maintenance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">A PROGRAM FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasing the level of physical activity would be beneficial to all ages and all groups, particularly for the prevention of obesity. There appears to be a dose effect for physical activity and weight loss, with very high levels being required in the absence of a diet to produce significant weight loss. The optimal strategy to lose weight is to combine a calorically reduced diet with gradually increasing amounts of physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Although exercise is not required for weight loss, increasing amounts physical activity during weight loss is important so that patients will be able to sustain adequate amounts of exercise to maintain the weight loss. In addition, physical activity during weight loss may prevent loss of lean body mass. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27963546\"><span class=\"h2\">Pre-exercise evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any exercise program should be designed to fit into the health and physical conditions of the participant. Persons who are about to begin an exercise program, even those whose only exercise will be walking, should be advised of the possibility of musculoskeletal stresses and strains and joint injury. Existing medical conditions, age, and preferences for types of exercise should all be considered in the decisions. Medical evaluation prior to initiation of an exercise program is typically not necessary for asymptomatic patients at low risk for coronary heart disease. However, there may be certain groups in which evaluation is warranted. This topic is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The benefits and risks of exercise&quot;, section on 'Medical evaluation prior to exercise'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27963618\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For those who are able, walking 150 to 250 minutes per week (&ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">min/day,</span> five to seven days per week) is beneficial in preventing weight gain and in improving cardiovascular health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/10,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,23</a>]. This will increase energy expenditure by 1000 to 1200 calories per week, or slightly more than 150 calories per day. The amount of energy expended depends upon the duration and intensity of the exercise and the subject's initial weight (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66344\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66344 \">table 2</a>). As an example, a 120-pound person walking three miles per hour expends slightly less than 2 calories per minute more than standing still. At 160 pounds, the difference is 2.4 calories per minute, and at 200 pounds, it is 3 calories per minute. Thus, a 30-minute walk at three miles per hour for a person weighing 200 pounds would dissipate an extra 90 calories as compared with 60 calories for a person weighing 120 pounds.</p><p>In the weight loss maintenance period, most people require &gt;60 minutes per day of moderate-intensity activity to successfully maintain the loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27963624\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise type and intensity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A multicomponent program that includes aerobic and resistance training is preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. As an example, a program that includes balance training (15 minutes) and flexibility (15 minutes) (particularly for older adults), aerobic exercise (30 minutes), and high-intensity resistance training (30 minutes) may be effective. However, any type of physical activity is better than none, and combining activities the patient is willing and able to do may be the most important factor to consider when designing a program for your patients.</p><p>The optimal combination of aerobic and resistance exercise is uncertain. In a meta-analysis of trials of progressive resistance strength training in adults, resistance strength training improved physical functioning in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In a subsequent trial, 136 obese men and women were randomly assigned to one of four groups (resistance, aerobic, combined, or sedentary control) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. After six months, body weight decreased by 0.64, 2.77, and 2.3 kg, respectively, and increased by 0.28 kg in the control group. Compared with the control group, cardiorespiratory fitness increased in the aerobic and combined-exercise groups. Abdominal and visceral fat decreased and endurance increased in the aerobic and combined groups, whereas skeletal mass and muscle strength increased in the resistance and combined-exercise groups. Insulin sensitivity improved in the aerobic and combined groups. Thus, combined aerobic and resistance training is optimal.</p><p>In another trial assessing intensity of exercise in 300 adults with central obesity, there were similar reductions in weight (5 to 6 percent decrease) and in waist circumference (-4.6 cm) with high- and low-intensity exercise, given fixed amounts of energy expenditure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, compared with control, only the high-intensity group showed significant reductions in two-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (75 g glucose load).</p><p>Finding appropriate places to exercise can facilitate any program of exercise. Health clubs or local YMCA or community centers may be helpful, but for most people, walking is the most appropriate form of exercise. In one study of obese women, the combination of diet plus advice to increase physical activity by incorporating short periods of activity into daily schedules (eg, walking instead of driving short distances, taking stairs instead of elevators) was as effective for inducing weight loss as diet plus structured aerobic activity (aerobics classes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H338511916\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
