However, pediatric MS, defined as onset of MS before the age of 18, is increasingly recognized. This disorder was previously known as early onset MS (EOMS) or juvenile MS.</p><p>Since pediatric MS is rare, clinicians who see a child with recurrent episodes of acute neurologic symptoms and white matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might initially consider a differential diagnosis that includes leukodystrophies, vasculopathies, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, mitochondrial defects, and other metabolic disorders, rather than MS. However, the calculated prevalence of pediatric MS (1.35 to 2.5 per 100,000 children) is in fact very similar to that of all forms of metachromatic leukodystrophy (2.5 per 100,000 births) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Given the availability of disease-modifying therapies for MS and the impact on future prognosis, it is important to consider the possibility of pediatric MS in all children with white matter disease.</p><p>The presentations, diagnostic evaluations, treatments, and prognosis for children with MS may differ from those of the more common adult form, and have been the subject of relatively few studies. Nevertheless, research in pediatric MS may provide clues into the underlying genetic substrate and environmental events that trigger this disease in both children and adults.</p><p>This topic will discuss the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of pediatric MS. The treatment and prognosis of pediatric MS is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of pediatric multiple sclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple sclerosis presents before the age of 18 in approximately 5 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Less than 1 percent of patients have onset of MS before the age of 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Pediatric MS affects girls more than boys, with a female to male ratio of 2.8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>MS is a rare disease in the pediatric population, with an estimated frequency of 1.35 to 2.5 per 100,000 children. In the United States, it is estimated that there are 8000 to 10,000 children with MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is caused by dysregulation of the peripheral immune system leading to injury in the central nervous system. Its pathogenesis requires the combination of a genetically susceptible individual and a particular environmental trigger.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic susceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence supporting genetic susceptibility comes from risk projections for the development of MS in family members of affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In general, the lifetime risk of MS in first-degree relatives of MS patients is five percent. Studies of monozygotic twins have consistently demonstrated an even higher risk (ie, concordance) of 25 percent for the development of MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], whereas the risk for dizygotic twins is similar to that for first-degree relatives.</p><p>Twin studies have suggested a non-Mendelian inheritance pattern for MS that likely reflects complex interactions between a number of immunologic, neuroprotective, and myelin-related genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Certain immunologic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes are associated with an increased risk for the development of MS, including haplotypes HLA DRB1*1501, DQA1*0102, and DQB1*0602 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The HLA-DR15 haplotype has been strongly associated with early disease onset in the MS population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Environmental triggers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Environmental exposure to a specific infectious agent during a window of immunologic vulnerability in childhood may predispose some individuals to the development of MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Many viral and bacterial pathogens have been putatively linked to demyelination. Of these, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has attracted much attention.</p><p>Exposure to EBV results in persistent B-cell infection, expansion of EBV-transformed B-cell clones, and the production of antibodies directed against specific EBV viral antigens as well as lifelong T-cell surveillance of infected B-cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. EBV nuclear antigen has a similar structure to myelin basic protein, a major component of central nervous system (CNS) myelin. T-cells directed against EBV antigens may be redirected to attack CNS myelin because of similarity between the antigens, a process termed molecular mimicry.</p><p>Adults with MS have near 100 percent seropositivity for EBV in comparison with 80 to 90 percent of healthy controls, a statistically significant difference. Nevertheless, given the high frequency of this infection in the general population, the pathobiologic significance remains uncertain.</p><p>Evidence of an etiologic role for EBV in MS may be stronger in the pediatric than the adult population. As examples, a multinational study found that serologic evidence for remote EBV infection was significantly higher in children with MS compared with age-matched controls (86 versus 64 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and similar results were reported in case-control studies from Canada and Germany [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>Because the pathogenesis of MS is thought to involve the immune system, it has been hypothesized that vaccination may increase the risk of developing MS. However, substantial evidence exists that there is no association between vaccines and MS in adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis#H721367375\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and epidemiology of multiple sclerosis&quot;, section on 'Vaccinations'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, a well-performed large population-based case-control study in children found that vaccination against hepatitis B was not associated with an increased risk of childhood-onset MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>There is a higher prevalence of multiple sclerosis at more northern latitudes, which has prompted other environmental considerations for the disease. Specific interest has arisen with vitamin D, which requires exposure of the skin to ultraviolet radiation for its normal biosynthesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis#H548438808\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and epidemiology of multiple sclerosis&quot;, section on 'Geographic factors'</a>.)</p><p>On a sunny day, up to 20,000 IU of vitamin D can be produced by cutaneous exposure for 15 minutes. Vitamin D is known to have immunoregulatory effects that include enhancing regulatory T-cell activity, upregulation of anti-inflammatory molecules, and downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Benefit of treatment with 1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D has been demonstrated in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis animal model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, vitamin D may have important perinatal effects on normal immune system regulation that persist over a lifetime. One study demonstrated a greater risk of MS for patients born in the month of May in countries of more northern latitude but a lower risk if born in November, suggesting gestation during winter months with less sunlight might adversely affect normal vitamin D production in the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Other studies have found an inverse correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and the risk for developing multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. The greatest risk reduction was found for individuals with higher levels under the age of 21 years. A small study of pediatric multiple sclerosis found that there was a 34 percent decrease in attacks for every 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> increase in the level of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) separated in space and time.

Lesions associated with ADEM are typically bilateral but may be asymmetric and tend to be poorly marginated. Almost all patients have multiple lesions in the deep and subcortical white matter.

Thus, in children &le;11 years of age with encephalopathy and multifocal neurologic deficits, application of the revised 2010 McDonald criteria for dissemination in space and time on initial MRI is considered inappropriate, and continued follow-up of clinical and MRI findings are needed to confirm a diagnosis of MS. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis can be considered if one attack that fulfills ADEM criteria is followed, three or more months later, by a nonencephalopathic episode associated with new MRI lesions that fulfill the 2010 McDonald criteria for dissemination in space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Approximately 80 percent of pediatric-onset MS cases and nearly all adolescent-onset MS cases present with attacks similar to those seen in adult CIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>].

The majority of children will not have recurrence after a single demyelinating event of the central nervous system (CNS). Clinical investigations, including brain MRI, cerebrospinal fluid analyses, and other laboratory studies, can provide useful information regarding which children are at higher risk for developing MS among those who have a CIS, but even with these studies, the ability to identify those at high risk for recurrence is inexact. In a cohort study from France that followed 296 children for an average of 2.9 years after a single acute CNS demyelinating event, the diagnosis of MS was confirmed in 57 percent of the children by the end of the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

The 2010 McDonald criteria allow dissemination in time to be met on a single MRI demonstrating the presence of both gadolinium-enhancing and nonenhancing lesions. This includes the baseline MRI taken at the time of the patient&rsquo;s initial presentation. In the absence of meeting such criteria at initial presentation, careful monitoring with detailed neurologic examination, psychometric testing, and imaging studies should be employed. A repeat MRI performed at any time after the initial study (most likely about one to two months later) that shows a single new T2 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gadolinium-enhancing lesion will also fulfill the dissemination in time criteria. Such close surveillance allows for early diagnosis and initiation of immunomodulatory therapies that may prevent greater disability over time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of pediatric multiple sclerosis&quot;, section on 'Interferons and glatiramer'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Brain MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A typical pattern consistent with MS on MRI is that of multiple well-demarcated lesions in the periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, and spinal cord white matter. These areas of demyelination are best recognized on T2-weighted sequences. T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image sequences are the most sensitive in this evaluation, especially for periventricular lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F82694\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82694 \">image 1</a>). T1-weighted sequences may demonstrate &quot;black holes&quot; or T1 hypointense lesions that represent complete tissue loss resulting from a previous inflammatory event (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F82694\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82694 \">image 1</a>). Enhancement of active areas of inflammation and blood-brain barrier compromise can be seen with T1 gadolinium contrast sequences.</p><p>In patients with an acquired demyelinating syndrome, brain MRI can be helpful for assessing risk of developing MS. In a prospective population-based cohort study of 302 children from Canada presenting with an acquired demyelinating syndrome who were followed for a median time of three years, the diagnosis of MS was made in 63 (21 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The factors most strongly associated with the risk of MS were the presence of one or more T2 lesions on initial brain MRI (HR 37.9, 95% CI 5.3-273.9) and the presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid (HR 6.33, 95% CI 3.4-12). A subsequent report analyzed 284 children from the same cohort using a multivariate model of MRI parameters of MS and found the likelihood of MS was predicted by the presence on baseline brain MRI of either one or more hypointense T1 lesions (HR 20.6, 95% CI 5.5-78.0) or one or more periventricular lesions (HR 3.3, 95% CI 1.3-8.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The risk of MS was highest when both findings were noted (HR 34.3, 95% CI 16.7-70.4).</p><p>Retrospective data suggest that children at MS onset have more T2 bright lesions in the posterior fossa and more gadolinium enhancing lesions than adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In addition, the lesions in children were more likely to be reversible on follow-up imaging than lesions in adults, suggesting better recovery of demyelination in children.</p><p>While rare, some children are found to have large, tumor-like demyelinating lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60288\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60288 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Some of these patients may have only modest neurologic deficits despite the remarkable size of these lesions. It is important to consider tumefactive demyelination in this setting so as to avoid unnecessary brain biopsy. Distinguishing characteristics might include the presence of &quot;black holes&quot; and MRI of the spine showing areas of demyelination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebrospinal fluid analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Detection of increased discrete immunoglobulin production solely within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is often useful for supporting the diagnosis of MS. A positive CSF is based upon the finding of either oligoclonal IgG bands (OCBs) different from any such bands in serum, or by an increased IgG index. The 2001 and 2005 McDonald criteria stated that a positive CSF in association with the development of new lesions on serial MRI scanning can be used to make the diagnosis of MS, even in those patients with a single clinical attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, in contrast to the earlier 2001 and 2005 McDonald criteria, the CSF findings are not incorporated into the 2010 criteria for dissemination in space except for the diagnosis of primary progressive MS.</p><p>Children with MS may have a different CSF profile than adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. However, data are limited to mainly small retrospective studies, and these have yielded inconsistent results, with positive OCBs reported in 8 to 92 percent, elevated IgG index in 64 to 75 percent, and pleocytosis in 33 to 73 percent of children with MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/60-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-65</a>].

MS begins before the age of 18 in at least 5 percent of patients who have MS, while onset before age 10 occurs in less than 1 percent. Nevertheless, pediatric MS is a rare disease, with an estimated frequency of 1.35 to 2.5 per 100,000 children. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MS is caused by dysregulation of the peripheral immune system leading to injury in the central nervous system. Its pathogenesis requires the combination of a genetically susceptible individual and a particular environmental trigger. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MS is characterized by recurrent episodes of demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) separated in space and time. Children with MS typically present with a clinically isolated syndrome such as optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, or a brainstem syndrome. A minority of children present with symptoms of encephalopathy (ie, headache, vomiting, seizure, or altered consciousness). In addition, the first attack of MS can resemble acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) on the basis of multifocal symptoms with encephalopathy in approximately 16 to 20 percent of children, most of whom are &le;11 years of age. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features and diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinically isolated syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The McDonald diagnostic criteria for MS require objective evidence of dissemination of demyelinating central nervous system lesions in both space and time, based upon either clinical findings alone or a combination of clinical and MRI findings. In a number of patients, the diagnosis of MS can be made with these criteria even in the absence of new clinical findings, and, for some patients, at the time of the initial attack. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) is a single attack compatible with MS, such as optic neuritis. An episode of CIS can create a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. Most children will not have recurrence after a single demyelinating event of the CNS. However, the risk is probably high enough to be concerning, though as yet not defined precisely.
