The use of these drugs in a variety of specific infections is discussed separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluoroquinolones are the only class of antimicrobial agents in clinical use that are direct inhibitors of bacterial DNA synthesis. Fluoroquinolones inhibit two bacterial enzymes, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which have essential and distinct roles in DNA replication. The quinolones bind to the complex of each of these enzymes with DNA; the resulting complexes, including the drug, block progress of the DNA replication enzyme complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Ultimately, this action results in damage to bacterial DNA and bacterial cell death. Thus, fluoroquinolones are bactericidal agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF RESISTANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resistance to quinolones may occur via mutations in chromosomal genes or via acquisition of resistance genes on plasmids; mutations in chromosomal genes occur in genes that [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Encode the subunits of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV (altered target mechanism)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regulate the expression of cytoplasmic membrane efflux pumps or proteins that constitute outer membrane diffusion channels (altered permeation mechanism)</p><p/><p>The likelihood of developing quinolone resistance is thought to be related to the intensity and duration of therapy. Support for the importance of duration comes from an in vitro model of <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>infection in which exposure to a quinolone for five days or more was associated with significant drug resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Plasmid-mediated resistance to the fluoroquinolones has been reported in some clinical strains of <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Enterobacter</em>, and other enteric bacteria due to expression of one of several plasmid-encoded Qnr proteins, which appear to protect DNA gyrase from quinolone action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. Plasmids encoding Qnr proteins produce low-level quinolone resistance, but they also usually cause resistance to other classes of antibiotics and have been found in strains with additional chromosomal mutations, resulting in high-level quinolone resistance along with multidrug resistance. Accumulation of mutations can result in highly resistant strains.</p><p>In one study, 313 ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates collected in the United States between 1999 and 2004 were screened for the known <em>qnr </em>genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A <em>qnr </em>gene was present in:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>20 percent of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> isolates</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>31 percent of <em>Enterobacter</em> spp isolates</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>4 percent of <em>E. coli</em> isolates</p><p/><p>Two other plasmid-mediated resistance mechanisms have been described and, like Qnr-mediated resistance, are linked to other antibiotic resistance genes on the same plasmid:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one case, a fluoroquinolone-modifying enzyme evolved by mutation of a plasmid-encoded gene for an aminoglycoside acetyltransferase; this mutant enzyme mediates low-level resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norfloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norfloxacin</a> as well as high-level resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This enzyme variant has been present since at least 1999 and is now widely disseminated in enteric gram-negative bacteria such as <em>E. coli</em>, <em>Klebsiella </em>spp, and <em>Enterobacter </em>spp in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a second case, a plasmid-encoded efflux pump, QepA, which pumps fluoroquinolones such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norfloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norfloxacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> out of the cell, confers low-level resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Isolates encoding the QepA protein have been found in Europe, Japan, China, and North America but usually only in low frequency. Another plasmid-encoded efflux pump, OqxAB, has been found in <em>E. coli </em>isolates from humans and swine and on the chromosome of <em>K. pneumoniae </em>isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology of resistant strains</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, acquired fluoroquinolone resistance has been most frequent in methicillin-resistant strains of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and in <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Fluoroquinolone use has also been identified as a risk factor for emergence of methicillin-resistant strains of <em>S. aureus </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The rate of fluoroquinolone resistance in <em>P. aeruginosa </em>in hospitals is increasing and has been related to increasing community and hospital use of these drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Increases in quinolone resistance are also occurring in enteric bacteria in United States intensive care units, often in association with resistance to other antimicrobials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Outbreaks of resistant <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae </em>have increased in the United States and in other parts of the world. Based upon surveillance data demonstrating increasing rates of resistance, fluoroquinolones are no longer recommended for the treatment of gonorrhea in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of uncomplicated Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Resistance in strains of <em>Campylobacter jejuni </em>has increased in patients with diarrhea due to this organism, with or without a history of foreign travel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although the incidence of resistance is currently low in the United States, an increase in fluoroquinolone resistance among strains of <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae </em>has been reported in a number of countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=resistance-of-streptococcus-pneumoniae-to-the-fluoroquinolones-doxycycline-and-trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to the fluoroquinolones, doxycycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acquisition of resistance has frequently been associated with fluoroquinolone use in animals or humans. For <em>Campylobacter </em>infections, there was a temporal link between the use of quinolones in animal feed and the occurrence of resistant isolates in animals and humans. Nosocomial transmission and coselection with the use of any antibiotic may also contribute to the high prevalence of resistance among methicillin-resistant, fluoroquinolone-resistant <em>S. aureus</em>. Resistant gonococci identified in outbreaks have been clonal, indicating person-to-person spread of these strains.</p><p>A case-control study of nosocomial acquisition of fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of <em>E. coli </em>or <em>K. pneumoniae </em>also confirmed recent fluoroquinolone use as an independent risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Other independent risk factors in this study of 123 patients with fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms and 70 controls with fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains included residence in a long-term care facility, recent aminoglycoside use, and older age. In other studies, <em>E. coli</em> isolates with acquired resistance or reduced susceptibility have been associated with length of stay and receipt of a first-generation cephalosporin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a> in hospitalized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], with fecal incontinence, presence of a urinary catheter, and receipt of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> in long-term care facility residents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] and with underlying renal disease and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrofurantoin</a> exposure in ambulatory women with urinary tract infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Notably, in the United States, a single <em>E. coli</em> strain type (ST131) with fluoroquinolone and multidrug resistance has emerged as dominant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECTRUM OF ACTIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluoroquinolones in current use have a wide spectrum of activity, but, as resistance has emerged over time, the percent of susceptible strains can vary among institutions and locales, emphasizing the importance of local susceptibility information for considering the choice of a fluoroquinolone or other antimicrobial agent. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Conventional bacteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The greatest activity of the fluoroquinolones is against aerobic gram-negative bacilli, particularly Enterobacteriaceae, and against <em>Haemophilus </em>spp and gram-negative cocci such as <em>Neisseria</em> spp and <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Drug interactions'</a> below.)</p><p>Another potential toxicity of fluoroquinolones is peripheral neuropathy. In a case-control study of men aged 45 to 80 years, current users of fluoroquinolones were at a higher risk of developing peripheral neuropathy than controls (rate ratio [RR] 1.83, 95% CI 1.49-2.27) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required label changes to better describe the risk of peripheral neuropathy associated with fluoroquinolones administered orally or by injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Peripheral neuropathy has been listed as a possible adverse effect in package inserts since 2004, but an FDA review determined that the potential rapid onset and risk of permanence were not adequately described. Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy may include pain, burning, tingling, numbness, weakness, or a change in sensation to light touch, pain, temperature, or the sense of body position. Peripheral neuropathy can occur at any time during treatment with a fluoroquinolone and can last for months to years after the drug is stopped or be permanent. In reported cases, the onset of peripheral neuropathy was rapid, often within a few days. No specific risk factors for the development of peripheral neuropathy have been identified in patients receiving a fluoroquinolone; the risk appears to be unrelated to the duration of therapy or the age of the patient. If a patient develops symptoms of peripheral neuropathy while receiving a fluoroquinolone, the fluoroquinolone should be stopped and the patient should be switched to an antibiotic from a different class, unless the benefit of continuing the fluoroquinolone outweighs the risk. Generally, the management of fluoroquinolone associated peripheral neuropathy is similar to the management of other drug-induced neuropathies, which includes stopping the offending agent and providing symptomatic care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-polyneuropathy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of polyneuropathy&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p>Fluoroquinolones have neuromuscular-blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in individuals with myasthenia gravis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Postmarketing reports have included death and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving fluoroquinolones. Thus, fluoroquinolones should be avoided in individuals with myasthenia gravis.</p><p>Fluoroquinolone use has also been associated with secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome, as illustrated by the findings of a case-control study evaluating healthcare records from over 6 million patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. Compared with nonuse, fluoroquinolone use within 15 or 30 days of diagnosis increased the risk of developing secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (adjusted rate ratios [aRR] for 15 days 5.67, 95% CI 2.72&ndash;11.83). Although the overall rate of the disorder was low, estimated at about 1 in 20,000, clinicians should be aware of this potential risk in patients with characteristic symptoms (eg, headache, tinnitus, diplopia).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Rash and other allergic manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergic and skin reactions have occurred in 0.4 to 2.2 percent of patients taking fluoroquinolones. Unspecified rashes have been most frequent. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemifloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemifloxacin</a>, has been studied prospectively and found to cause a mild rash in 2.8 percent of patients overall but an unexpectedly high rate (14 percent) in women under 40 years of age who received the drug for seven or more days. If the duration of therapy is limited to five days, rash occurs in 1.2 to 2.1 percent of patients. A second course of gemifloxacin should not be given to patients who developed a rash during an initial course.

The absolute risk of hypoglycemia was 10.0 for moxifloxacin, 9.3 for levofloxacin, 7.9 for ciprofloxacin, 3.2 for cephalosporins, and 3.7 for macrolides. The adjusted odds ratios for hyperglycemia associated with moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin compared with macrolides were 2.48 (95% CI 1.50-4.12), 1.75 (95% CI 1.12-2.73), and 1.87 (95% CI 1.20-2.93), respectively, and the aORs for hypoglycemia were 2.13 (95% CI 1.44-3.14), 1.79 (95% CI 1.33-2.42), and 1.46 (95% CI 1.07-2.00), respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematologic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leukopenia and eosinophilia generally occur in less than 1 percent of patients; these abnormalities are rarely of sufficient severity to require cessation of therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H142842158\"><span class=\"h2\">Retinal detachment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retinal detachment has been reported with fluoroquinolone use; however, a causal relationship has not been established. Several large observational studies have attempted to assess whether an association between fluoroquinolone use and retinal detachment exists, with conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/140-145\" class=\"abstract_t\">140-145</a>].</p><p>A nationwide registry-based cohort study from Denmark that controlled for potential confounders found that neither recent nor current fluoroquinolone use was associated with an increased risk of retinal detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. Similarly, in a large population-based study in the United States, fluoroquinolone use was not associated with an increased risk of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or symptomatic retinal breaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>].</p><p>In contrast, a nested case-control study of patients in Canada who visited an ophthalmologist found an increased rate of retinal detachment in patients who were currently receiving an oral fluoroquinolone (3.3 percent of cases versus 0.6 percent of controls; aOR 4.5, 95% CI 3.6-5.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>]. The absolute increase in the risk of retinal detachment was 4 per 10,000 person-years. In a case-crossover study using French healthcare databases that included 27,540 patients with retinal detachment, there was an increased risk for retinal detachment during the 10-day period after being prescribed a fluoroquinolone (aOR 1.46, 95% CI 1.15-1.87) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>]. The risk was increased for both rhegmatogenous (full-thickness; aOR 1.41, 95% CI 1.04-1.92) and exudative (aOR 2.57, 95% CI 1.46-4.53) retinal detachment. Recent and past use of fluoroquinolones were not associated with retinal detachment.</p><p>Based on the above data and other reports, the FDA issued an update in May 2017 stating that available data do not support a causal association between fluoroquinolones and retinal detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>]. If an association exists, the risk of retinal detachment attributable to fluoroquinolone use is likely small and may be limited to individuals with additional predisposing risk factors.</p><p>Retinal detachment is discussed in greater detail separately.

The risk was higher in patients over 70 years of age and in women and increased with duration of exposure from &lt;3 days to 3 to 14 days. Even with propensity adjustment, there remains the possibility of residual confounding and the possibility of bias if symptoms of aortic aneurysm or dissection triggered fluoroquinolone use prior to the diagnosis.</p><p>In a longitudinal cohort study of patients 65 years and older in Canada, current fluoroquinolone use had an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.40 (95% CI 2.25-2.57) for tendon rupture and 2.24 (95% CI 2.02-2.49) for aortic aneurysm, values that were substantially greater than those for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>].</p><p>Based on these studies and other reports, the FDA issued an update in May 2017 stating that available data do not support a causal association between fluoroquinolones and aortic aneurysm or dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>].

For patients with these infections, fluoroquinolones should be reserved for those who have no alternative treatment options. In most cases of acute sinusitis and acute bronchitis, viral rather than bacterial infections are common, and antimicrobials may not be needed. This announcement was based on an FDA safety review showing that systemic fluoroquinolone use is associated with side effects, which although uncommon can be disabling and potentially permanent, including those involving the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system.</p><p>Adverse reactions are discussed in detail above.

This section will review the most important or frequent interactions; a complete listing is provided separately for each fluoroquinolone (see appropriate drug information topic reviews by searching on the drug name). In addition, specific interactions of fluoroquinolones with other medications may be determined using the drug interaction tool (Lexi-Interact Online). This tool can be accessed from the UpToDate online search page or through the individual drug information topics, section on Drug interactions.</p><p>When coadministered by mouth with aluminum-, magnesium-, or, to a lesser extent, calcium-containing antacids, quinolones have markedly reduced oral bioavailability, presumably because of the formation of cation-quinolone complexes, which are poorly absorbed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sucralfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sucralfate</a>, which contains large amounts of aluminum ions, also reduces absorption of quinolones. Although staggering of doses of antacids and quinolones may reduce this interaction, there is sufficient variability to suggest that this maneuver may not be fully reliable in an individual patient. Generally, H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors do not have important effects on absorption of quinolones.</p><p>Concurrent administration of quinolones with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferrous sulfate</a>, multivitamin-mineral regimens containing zinc, and the buffered formulation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=didanosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">didanosine</a> has also been reported to reduce quinolone absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>]. Nutritional supplements given by nasogastric tube may reduce the absorption of quinolones given concurrently by the same route, likely because these supplements also contain multivalent cations such as iron and zinc.</p><p>For the intravenous formulation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>, precipitates have been reported when this preparation was infused through the same intravenous tubing with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aminophylline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> with and without clavulanate, or flucloxacillin. Thus, separate infusions are indicated.</p><p>Quinolones vary in the extent to which they impair the elimination of the methylxanthines, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a>, and caffeine. The effects appear to result from inhibition by some quinolones of hepatic cytochrome P450 isozyme 1A2, which is involved in theophylline and caffeine metabolism. Some effects are seen with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> (20 to 90 percent increase), but <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norfloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norfloxacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofloxacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemifloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemifloxacin</a> have little or no effect (2 to 11 percent increases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/153,154\" class=\"abstract_t\">153,154</a>]. In patients receiving ciprofloxacin in combination with theophylline, serum levels of theophylline should be monitored and reductions in the dose of theophylline considered.</p><p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may affect the central nervous system stimulant effects of quinolones. Seizures were reported in a group of Japanese patients receiving enoxacin and the NSAID fenbufen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Potentiation of seizures by combinations of quinolones and NSAIDs has also been reported in animals. Quinolones displace the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) from its receptors in rat brain tissue, and this displacement is enhanced by fenbufen and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a>. The extent to which concurrent use of quinolones with other NSAIDs results in central nervous system toxicities is unclear, but patients receiving both classes of drugs should be cautioned about and monitored for these adverse effects.</p><p>As noted above, fluoroquinolones can prolong QT interval by inhibiting potassium channels involved in cardiac repolarization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. This effect may be augmented if fluoroquinolones are given together with any of the multiple other drugs that cause QT prolongation, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 3</a>).

Thus, fluoroquinolones should usually <strong>not</strong> be given together with other drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Specific drug combinations that should be avoided are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'QT interval prolongation and arrhythmia'</a> above.)</p><p>Other types of drug interactions have been studied less extensively. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rifampin</a> appears not to affect the pharmacokinetics of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>. Ciprofloxacin has had effects on the pharmacokinetics of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>. Enoxacin and ciprofloxacin have been shown to reduce the clearance of the less active R-enantiomer of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> but have no clinically important effect on the more active S-enantiomer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoroquinolones/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H527964309\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluoroquinolones are the only class of antimicrobial agents in clinical use that are direct inhibitors of bacterial DNA synthesis.
