Thoracic endometriosis involves components of the thoracic cavity (eg, pleura, parenchyma, diaphragm, bronchus). The following terms apply:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term &quot;thoracic&rdquo; endometriosis is used when endometrial tissue is identified on histological specimens (hormone receptor-positive endometrial stroma and glands) obtained from chest tube aspirate, thoracotomy, or bronchoscopy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term &ldquo;probable&rdquo; thoracic endometriosis refers to the identification of tissue within the thorax that is suggestive but not definitively diagnostic of endometrium (eg, stroma only or hormone negative tissue) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnostic-approach-and-treatment-of-adults-with-thoracic-endometriosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term &ldquo;thoracic endometriosis syndrome&rdquo; is used when one or more clinical manifestations of thoracic involvement is present (eg, pneumothorax, hemothorax, hemoptysis, chest pain) in association with menstruation but without histological confirmation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term &ldquo;catamenial&rdquo; refers to a temporal relationship with menses. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1423032513\"><span class=\"h1\">PNEUMOTHORAX</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thoracic endometriosis should always be suspected in young women during their reproductive age with catamenial pneumothorax or hemothorax, especially in those who have a history of prior uterine surgical procedures or proven pelvic endometriosis (present in 65 to 84 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnostic-approach-and-treatment-of-adults-with-thoracic-endometriosis/abstract/4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-9</a>]. In such patients, the diagnostic and therapeutic approach is often performed simultaneously (eg, thorascopic biopsy, blebectomy, and pleurodesis). &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1613534575\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Signs and symptoms</strong> &ndash; The most common presentation (70 to 73 percent) of thoracic endometriosis is catamenial pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnostic-approach-and-treatment-of-adults-with-thoracic-endometriosis/abstract/3,4,10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,10-13</a>]. A smaller proportion (approximately 15 percent), has catamenial pneumothorax due to probable thoracic involvement, and 10 percent or less have pneumothorax that has no temporal relationship with menses (non-catamenial pneumothorax) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnostic-approach-and-treatment-of-adults-with-thoracic-endometriosis/abstract/5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13</a>]. Patients with endometriosis-related non-catamenial pneumothorax are typically identified during surgery for recurrent pneumothorax. Thus, it is important to recognize that endometriosis-related pneumothoraces can be catamenial and non-catamenial and conversely, non-catamenial pneumothoraces can be endometriosis- or non-endometriosis-related. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Symptoms usually begin just before or within 72 hours after the onset of menstruation (rarely 96 hours). Chest or scapular pain is the most common symptom, noted by 90 percent of patients, while dyspnea develops in approximately one-third [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnostic-approach-and-treatment-of-adults-with-thoracic-endometriosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Examination findings may reveal reduced breath sounds <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tracheal deviation. Symptoms and signs are usually right-sided. Importantly, clinicians should not expect that pneumothoraces or symptoms appear on a regular monthly basis but rather can be intermittent (months to years) and simply bear a close relationship with menses.

Thus, in patients who present with primary spontaneous pneumothorax, eliciting a history of prior episodes and of timing with the menstrual cycle for each episode is helpful for diagnosis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In our experience, women do not present during or following pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Imaging features</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Chest radiography</strong> &ndash; Pneumothoraces on chest radiography can be of any size and are typically right-sided (88 to 100 percent), but can also be left-sided or bilateral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnostic-approach-and-treatment-of-adults-with-thoracic-endometriosis/abstract/3,5,10,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,10,14-16</a>]. Occasionally, pneumomediastinum or pneumoperitoneum is evident. Chest radiographs may additionally reveal other associated features of thoracic endometriosis including an effusion due to hemothorax with or without mediastinal shift depending upon the size, parenchymal nodules and cavities, and a nodular appearance of the diaphragm due to abdominal viscus protrusion through diaphragmatic perforations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnostic-approach-and-treatment-of-adults-with-thoracic-endometriosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Chest computed tomography (CT)</strong> &ndash; Chest CT scans are most likely to show abnormalities when patients are symptomatic (eg, perimenstrual) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F100735\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100735 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnostic-approach-and-treatment-of-adults-with-thoracic-endometriosis/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. Due to the higher resolution of CT, abnormalities not visualized on chest radiography may be better appreciated using this modality.

However, LAM usually presents with characteristic cysts and angiomyolipomas on computed tomography. Cysts are also usually evident in lung diseases associated with pneumothorax including Birt-Hogg-Dub&eacute; syndrome (which is more common in young males), pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (older smokers), lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (eg Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome), and premature emphysema.

However, when thoracic endometriosis is suspected clinically, patients should undergo contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging of the chest, preferably when symptoms are present (ie, usually during menses). CT is also frequently performed to rule out the presence of other etiologies of the presenting complaint and may also &ldquo;map&rdquo; lesions prior to surgery.</p><p>For young women who present with their first episode of pneumothorax and a negative CT,&nbsp;most experts wait for a second event to establish a temporal relationship with menses before proceeding with thoracoscopy. Some experts send pleural fluid for the evaluation of endometrial cells during the initial placement of a thoracostomy tube, although the diagnostic yield is probably low. For patients in whom the CT or pleural fluid cytology is suggestive of the diagnosis (eg, pleurodiaphragmatic nodules or endometrial stromal cells), tube thoracostomy has failed, or those who have a <span class=\"nowrap\">second/recurrent</span> event, most clinicians proceed with thoracoscopy. The purpose of thoracoscopy is to perform the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gross inspection of the pleura and diaphragm &ndash; Thoracoscopy allows direct visualization of endometrial implants (pleural and diaphragmatic) and diaphragmatic perforations characteristic of thoracic endometriosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82975\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82975 \">picture 1</a>).

When indicated, VATS is usually performed for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Typically, a decision is made to perform blebectomy and pleurodesis to prevent recurrence even if the diagnosis is not histologically confirmed but is clinically suspected. </p><p>There is no consensus on the optimal number of blebs that should be resected or on the optimal type of pleurodesis.

However, prolonged therapy with GnRH analogs is often complicated by intolerance from the acute symptoms of menopause and the risk of osteoporosis. Consequently, the decision to use GnRH analogs is dependent upon weighing the benefits of reduced recurrence against the adverse effects in the context of patient preferences regarding the temporary induction of menopause and inability to become pregnant.</p><p>For those not willing to become menopausal or who have a contraindication to GnRH analogs, oral contraceptives or progestins, and less commonly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a> or aromatase inhibitors, are alternatives.

Thoracic endometriosis is that which involves components of thoracic cavity (eg, pleura, parenchyma, diaphragm, bronchus). (See <a href=\"#H1423032771\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thoracic endometriosis most commonly presents in young women as catamenial pneumothorax (70 to 73 percent) and catamenial hemothorax (12 to 14 percent). Less common presentations include catamenial hemoptysis, catamenial chest or scapular pain, noncatamenial pneumothorax or hemothorax, a parenchymal cavity or nodule, or diaphragmatic rupture. A high index of suspicion should exist in women of reproductive age who present with any of these features, especially when the findings are right-sided, symptoms present perimenstrually (usually 24 hours before, and up to 72 hours after menses), or the patient has a history of pelvic surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1423032513\" class=\"local\">'Pneumothorax'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1423032526\" class=\"local\">'Hemothorax'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1423032533\" class=\"local\">'Hemoptysis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1423032540\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary nodules'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When suspected, patients should undergo contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the chest, preferably when symptoms are present (ie, perimenstrual). Magnetic resonance imaging may be useful for those with diaphragmatic nodules suspected to be endometriosis. For those in whom the clinical suspicion is high <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> imaging is supportive of the diagnosis, we suggest that most patients undergo an interventional procedure (eg, thoracoscopy) which serves both to manage the primary presenting feature and diagnose the underlying thoracic endometriosis. (See <a href=\"#H1423032513\" class=\"local\">'Pneumothorax'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1423032526\" class=\"local\">'Hemothorax'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1423032533\" class=\"local\">'Hemoptysis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1423032540\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary nodules'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with pneumothorax in whom endometriosis is suspected (eg, first pneumothorax with suspicious imaging findings, recurrent or catamenial pneumothorax, coexistent hemothorax), we suggest video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) pleural inspection, blebectomy, and pleurodesis. During VATS, we also perform endometrial implant resection and ligation of diaphragmatic perforations, if found. Following diagnosis, we suggest postoperative hormonal suppressive therapy for 6 to 12 months rather than no therapy, to reduce the risk of recurrence (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The agent of choice for hormonal suppression is typically gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs. (See <a href=\"#H1423032513\" class=\"local\">'Pneumothorax'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1645455928\" class=\"local\">'Hormonal suppression'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all other patients in whom thoracic endometriosis is suspected, the diagnostic and therapeutic approach should be individualized and focus on definitively managing the presenting feature followed by secondary prevention of recurrence, most often by hormonal suppression for 6 to 12 months. (See <a href=\"#H1423032526\" class=\"local\">'Hemothorax'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1423032533\" class=\"local\">'Hemoptysis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1423032540\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary nodules'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1423032547\" class=\"local\">'Other clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1645455928\" class=\"local\">'Hormonal suppression'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thoracic endometriosis is typically a diagnosis that is made clinically and, although histopathologic confirmation is preferred, it is not necessary. In the correct clinical context, most clinicians use a combination of imaging features (eg, diaphragmatic nodules identified on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), as well as gross (eg, pleural nodules and diaphragmatic fenestrations seen via pleuroscopy or VATS) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> microscopic findings (endometrial tissue) to support the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H2258262338\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with disease refractory to primary intervention and hormonal suppression, the optimal therapy is unknown. Options include switching to an alternate hormonal agent (eg, from oral contraceptives to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a>), pleurectomy and repeat pleurodesis for recalcitrant pneumothorax or hemothorax, and rarely, hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Refractory disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During follow-up, patients should be fully assessed by history and examination for recurrent catamenial or non-catamenial symptoms suggestive of residual disease as well as for the signs and symptoms of pelvic disease. Patients should also undergo repeat imaging to ensure resolution of the pneumothorax, effusion, or nodule, and monitored for adverse effects from medical and surgical therapies.
