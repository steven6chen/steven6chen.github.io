The prostate gland makes fluid that is part of semen. This gland sits below the bladder and in front of the rectum, and forms a ring around the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65675\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65675 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Prostate cancer occurs most often in men older than 50. Although prostate cancer is very common, most men do not die from it. This is because prostate cancer usually grows very slowly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H457221528\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of prostate cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prostate cancer often causes no symptoms at first. But if symptoms do occur, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Needing to urinate more often than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A urine stream that is slower than usual</p><p/><p>These symptoms can also be caused by conditions that are not prostate cancer. But if you have these symptoms, you should let your doctor or nurse know.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H457221535\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for prostate cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Doctors use a blood test called a PSA test and an exam called a rectal exam to check for prostate cancer. In a rectal exam, your doctor or nurse puts a finger in your anus and up into your rectum. He or she presses on the rectum wall to feel for abnormal areas on the prostate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F80412\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80412 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>If your doctor or nurse suspects you have prostate cancer, he or she will follow up with one or more tests. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy &ndash; A doctor will take a small sample of tissue from the prostate. Then another doctor will look at the sample under a microscope to see if it has cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound, MRI scan, or other imaging tests &ndash; These tests create images of the inside of the body and can show abnormal growths.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H457221542\"><span class=\"h1\">What is cancer staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer staging is a way in which doctors find out how far a cancer has spread.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H457221549\"><span class=\"h1\">How is prostate cancer treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Men with prostate cancer often have a choice of treatment.</p><p>The main treatments for prostate cancer are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Active surveillance</strong> &ndash; Men who choose this option do not have treatment right away. But they do have routine tests to check whether the cancer starts to grow more quickly. If so, they can start active treatment then.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgery</strong> &ndash; Prostate cancer can sometimes be treated with surgery to remove the prostate gland.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Radiation therapy</strong> &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells. Radiation can be given from a machine that moves around your body. Or a doctor might put a source of radiation directly into the prostate gland.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hormone therapy</strong> &ndash; Male hormones in the body make prostate cancer grow. Hormone therapy reduces the levels of these hormones, which can shrink the cancer. For hormone therapy, men might take medicines. Or they might have surgery to remove the testicles. (Male hormones are made in the testicles.) This treatment is usually only for men with advanced cancer. But some men with early stage cancer get it along with radiation or surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. Men with advanced prostate cancer might get chemotherapy if hormone therapy stops working. In some cases, chemotherapy and hormone therapy are given at the same time.</p><p/><p>Some men, especially older men with other serious medical conditions, might choose not to do any of the above. Instead, they might choose &quot;watchful waiting.&quot; Watchful waiting is not exactly the same as active surveillance. It does not require regular testing, but involves treating symptoms when they happen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H457221556\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I choose which treatment to have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You and your doctor will have to work together to choose the right treatment for you. The right treatment will depend on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The stage of your cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether you have other health problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How you feel about the treatment options</p><p/><p>Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H457221563\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, some men keep getting checked to see if the cancer comes back or starts growing more quickly. Other men choose not to be checked. Follow-up tests can include PSA tests, exams, biopsies, or imaging tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H457221570\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if the cancer comes back or spreads?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the cancer comes back, you might have more radiation therapy, surgery, or hormone therapy. You might also have chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H457221577\"><span class=\"h1\">Can prostate cancer be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Men who are at high risk of getting prostate cancer can sometimes take a medicine to help prevent the disease. If you have a family history of prostate cancer, talk to your doctor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H457221584\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-are-clinical-trials-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What are clinical trials?
