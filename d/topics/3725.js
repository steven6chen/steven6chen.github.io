MAS can present with varying degrees of severity from mild respiratory distress to life-threatening respiratory failure.</p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of MAS will be discussed here. The management and complications of MAS are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of meconium aspiration syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, a retrospective multicenter study of 162,075 term infants born between 1997 and 2007 reported 1.8 percent of infants had an admission diagnosis of MAS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>MAS occurs in approximately 2 to 10 percent of infants born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF). This was illustrated in a study from a single tertiary center of 20,047 live births between 1994 and 1998 that reported MSAF occurring in 9.2 percent and MAS in 0.1 percent of all live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>This 10-fold difference in the incidence of MAS may be due to differences between the two studies in the rigor that MAS was diagnosed and measures used to prevent MAS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome#H182584917\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of meconium aspiration syndrome&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p>The incidence of MSAF varies with gestational age with a nadir at approximately 31 weeks. This was best illustrated by a large English multicenter study of approximately 500,000 singleton births that reported rates of MSAF in preterm, term, and postterm infants of 5.1, 16.5, and 27.1 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, in the subgroup of preterm infants, rates were higher for those born &le;30 weeks compared with those with a gestational age between 31 and 36 weeks. After 31 weeks, the incidence of MSAF increases with gestational age. After excluding preterm infants, the rates of MSAF were higher in black (22.6 percent) and South Asian infants (16.8 percent) compared with those who were white (15.7 percent). Logistic regression analysis showed independent predictors for MSAF included advanced gestation, black or South Asian ethnicity, and vaginal breech delivery.</p><p>The risk of MAS and MSAF is greatest in postmature and small for gestational age infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Changes in obstetric care, especially a reduction in postmature births, appear to be associated with a decrease in the incidence of MAS. This was illustrated in the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study of 1365 infants &ge;37 weeks gestational age born through MSAF at a single center from 1990 to 1998, MAS decreased nearly fourfold (from 5.8 to 1.5 percent in 1990 to 1992 and 1997 to 1998, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This was associated with a significant reduction in births &ge;41 weeks gestation (from 42 to 28 percent), as well as increased use of amnioinfusion, diagnosis of nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns, and cesarean delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A significant decrease in the incidence of severe MAS (requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation) was also noted over an eight-year period in Australia and New Zealand from 1995 to 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The lowest incidence was 0.35 per 1000 live births in 2002. The lower incidence was attributed to improving obstetrical management with fewer deliveries beyond 41 weeks gestation and fewer infants with five-minute Apgar scores of less than 7 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-apgar-score\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). These two changes accounted for approximately 62 percent of the reduction in severe MAS cases.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of MAS involves intrauterine passage of meconium, aspiration, and pulmonary disease, which results in hypoxemia and acidosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56521\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef56521 \">algorithm 1</a>). Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) frequently accompanies severe MAS and contributes to hypoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Birth depression occurs in 20 to 33 percent of infants born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>] and likely is caused by pathologic intrauterine processes, primarily chronic asphyxia and infection. This intrauterine stress leads to the passage and aspiration of meconium by the fetus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Composition of meconium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meconium is a thick, black-green, odorless material first demonstrable in the fetal intestine during the third month of gestation. Meconium results from the accumulation of debris, including desquamated cells from the intestine and skin, gastrointestinal mucin, lanugo hair, fatty material from the vernix caseosa, amniotic fluid, and intestinal secretions. It contains blood group-specific glycoproteins and a small amount of lipid and protein that decreases during gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The black-green color results from bile pigments.</p><p>Meconium is sterile. However, when aspirated into the lung, it may stimulate the release of cytokines and other vasoactive substances that lead to cardiovascular and inflammatory responses in the fetus and newborn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In patients with MAS, pulmonary function improves with the fall of proinflammatory cytokines over the first 96 hours of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. There are also animal data that implicate pancreatic phospholipase A2 as a potential source of the lung injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Meconium passage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Passage of meconium occurs early in the first trimester of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Fetal defecation slows after 16 weeks gestation and becomes infrequent by 20 weeks, concurrent with innervation of the anal sphincter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. From approximately 20 to 34 weeks, fetal passage of meconium remains infrequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Almost all fetuses and newborn infants who pass meconium are at term or postterm gestation.</p><p>Meconium passage may be caused by increased peristalsis and relaxation of the anal sphincter due to increased vagal outflow associated with umbilical cord compression or increased sympathetic inflow during hypoxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. In one study, fetuses that passed meconium prior to birth had higher motilin levels in cord blood compared to those who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The higher levels of motilin, a regulatory intestinal peptide, were thought to be related to increased parasympathetic tone due to fetal hypoxia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the development of the gastrointestinal tract&quot;, section on 'Hormonal regulation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Aspiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meconium in amniotic fluid can be aspirated during fetal gasping or in the initial breaths after delivery. Normally, fetal breathing activity results in movement of lung fluid out of the trachea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, as shown in animals, prolonged hypoxia stimulates fetal breathing and gasping that can lead to inhalation of amniotic fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-29</a>]. Pathologic evidence suggests that this process also occurs in humans. Meconium has been found in the lungs of infants who were stillborn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] or who died soon after birth without a history of aspiration at delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>Meconium that remains in the hypopharynx or trachea after delivery can be aspirated during the initial breaths. This is more likely to occur in a depressed infant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aspirated meconium can interfere with normal breathing by several mechanisms. These include airway obstruction, chemical irritation and inflammation, infection, and surfactant inactivation. However, it is likely that most cases of severe MAS are primarily caused by intrauterine pathologic processes, primarily asphyxia and infection, rather than the aspiration of meconium by itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Airway obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway obstruction can be complete or partial. Complete obstruction leads to distal atelectasis. Partial airway obstruction occurs when particulate meconium partly occludes the airway. Because the airway diameter is larger in inspiration, gas can enter around the partial obstruction. However, as the airway narrows during exhalation, the meconium plug occludes the airway completely, trapping the gas distally. This process is known as a ball valve effect and can lead to overdistention of the lung and alveolar rupture, with resulting pneumothorax or other air leak complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].

Direct injury and inflammation result in an exudative and inflammatory pneumonitis with epithelial disruption, proteinaceous exudation with alveolar collapse, and cellular necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-39</a>]. In animal studies, pancreatic phospholipase A2 appears to directly contribute to lung injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MSAF is a risk factor for bacterial infection of the amniotic cavity and should alert the clinician to the potential for increased neonatal morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>] Although meconium is sterile, the mucopolysaccharide component provides an excellent growth medium for microorganisms, especially <em>Escherichia coli</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

In human infants, concentrations of surfactant inhibitors (eg, total protein, albumin, membrane-derived phospholipid) were higher in lung lavage fluid in those with MAS than in controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

All 19 patients had signs of respiratory distress within 15 minutes of birth, which required ventilatory support in 16 of the infants. These results demonstrate that full-term infants with MSAF without any sign of respiratory distress or depression immediately after birth are unlikely to develop MAS.</p><p>Affected infants typically have a barrel-shaped chest with an increased anterior-posterior diameter caused by overinflation. Auscultation reveals rales and rhonchi. These signs usually are seen immediately after birth.

Patient with severe disease are at risk for respiratory failure, which is often associated with persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN). Infants with pulmonary hypertension and right-to-left shunting may have a gradient in oxygenation between pre- and postductal arterial blood samples.

MAS can present with varying degrees of severity from mild respiratory distress to life-threatening with respiratory failure.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With changes in obstetric care, the incidence of MAS has declined to approximately 0.1 to 1.8 percent of live births in developed countries. Risk factors for MAS include postmaturity and small for gestational age. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathophysiology of MAS involves intrauterine passage of meconium, aspiration, and pulmonary disease resulting in hypoxemia, acidosis, and potentially pulmonary hypertension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56521\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef56521 \">algorithm 1</a>). Pulmonary disease is a result of aspirated meconium interfering with normal lung function due to airway obstruction, chemical irritation and inflammation, and deleterious effects on surfactant metabolism (ie, inactivation and reduced production). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with MAS typically have a history of MSAF or evidence of meconium staining on physical examination. They are frequently small for gestational age or postmature. Many infants with MAS also have neurologic or respiratory depression due to perinatal hypoxia. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients present with respiratory distress with marked tachypnea, cyanosis, intercostal and subxiphoid retractions, abdominal breathing, grunting, and nasal flaring. The chest appears barrel-shaped (increased anterior-posterior diameter) due to overinflation. In patients with severe MAS, complications include air leaks (eg, pneumothorax) and persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary disease'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-air-leak-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary air leak in the newborn&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of MAS is based on the clinical findings of MSAF or meconium-stained infant, respiratory distress, and characteristic radiographic features. The radiologic findings are initially streaky, linear densities, followed by hyperinflation, and alternating diffuse patchy densities with areas of expansion. In patients who require intubation, the diagnosis is established by the presence of meconium in the trachea. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MAS is differentiated from other causes of neonatal respiratory distress (eg, transient tachypnea of the newborn, neonatal pneumonia, and congenital cyanotic heart disease) based upon the history, physical examination, clinical course, and radiographic findings. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of suspected MAS includes chest radiography, arterial blood gas and pulse oximetry, blood cultures, and if possible, tracheal aspirate cultures. In patients with more severe disease, an echocardiography may be indicated to exclude structural heart disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PPHN.
