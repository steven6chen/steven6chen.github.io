Electroconvulsive therapy is the oldest neurostimulation procedure (it also predates all antidepressant drugs), and is the most effective intervention for unipolar major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-in-adults-overview-of-neuromodulation-procedures/abstract/3,4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,7</a>].

A course of ECT involves a series of treatments that are delivered over several days to weeks.

Although ECT is the most efficacious treatment for major depression, it is associated with safety risks, adverse effects, logistical constraints, patient refusal, and high relapse rates.

It is not clear if MST is as effective as ECT. However, MST may cause fewer physical (eg, headaches and myalgias) and cognitive side effects than ECT. (See <a href=\"#H2496009\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic seizure therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal electrically administered seizure therapy is a noninvasive, investigational approach that combines unidirectional current, control of polarity, and an asymmetric electrode arrangement in an attempt to induce seizures more efficiently than ECT.
