Although most patients with MVP have mild, trivial, or no MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], MVP is the most common cause of surgical MR in developed countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Other potential complications include infective endocarditis and arrhythmias. The diagnosis of MVP is suspected on physical examination and confirmed by echocardiography. </p><p>The definition, classification, etiology, pathology, and diagnosis of MVP will be reviewed here. Other aspects of MVP and associated MR are discussed separately.

Reports published early in the development of echocardiography suggested high MVP prevalence, 4 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>] and even close to 20 percent in selected populations. These early reports are now considered inaccurate because echocardiographic criteria for diagnosis were not yet fully developed and lacked specificity. </p><p>Using currently accepted definition of MVP, the Framingham Heart Study reported an overall prevalence of 2.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Individuals with classic MVP (leaflet thickness &ge;5 mm; 1.3 percent) and non-classic MVP (leaflet thickness &lt;5mm; 1.1 percent) had similar age and sex distributions. In another population-based study (Cardia), the prevalence of MVP in 4136 young adults was only 0.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In a Canadian study of 972 patients, MVP prevalence was similar in three ethnic groups (2.7 percent in South Asian, 3.1 percent in European, and 2.2 percent in Chinese) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. MVP patients were leaner and had a greater degree of mitral regurgitation than the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. It is unclear whether prevalence differences between studies are age-related and should be interpreted as demonstrating a link between aging and MVP prevalence. </p><p>MVP may be slightly more common in women than in men. In the Framingham study, there was a nonsignificant trend toward a female preponderance among those with MVP (59.5 versus 52.7 percent in those without MVP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]; in the larger Olmsted county study, 64 percent of individuals with MVP were women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The majority of patients with MVP have mitral regurgitation (MR) (70 percent in one cross-sectional population-based study), but most patients with MVP (approximately 75 percent in the same study) have mild, trace, or no MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Severe MR is uncommon, identified in 4 percent of patients with MVP. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28356750\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) was previously based upon a combination of clinical exam findings and echocardiographic criteria; the current definition relies on imaging alone. </p><p>The current imaging definition of MVP is billowing of any portion of the mitral leaflets &ge;2 mm above the annular plane in a long axis view (parasternal or apical three-chamber) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83594\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83594 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Prolapse of the mitral valve is defined as an abnormal systolic displacement of one or both leaflets into the left atrium (systolic billowing) due to a disruption or elongation of leaflets, chordae, or papillary muscles. Simple override of the anterior leaflet (commonly seen in ischemic mitral regurgitation, due to tethering of the posterior mitral leaflet) must be distinguished from MVP, as this has therapeutic implications. Indeed, percutaneous repair with the MitraClip system is an approved indication for primary MVP, but not for ischemic mitral regurgitation at this time. </p><p>This abnormal movement has been challenging to define given the saddle shape of the mitral annulus, which is accentuated in systole due to displacement of the annulus at the commissures towards the ventricular apex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Thus, in the apical four chamber view, the leaflets may appear posterior to the annulus, even in a completely normal subject [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. These observations published in the late 1980s led to a change in the accepted echocardiographic view for identification of MVP from &ldquo;any view&rdquo; to &ldquo;a (three chamber) long-axis view&rdquo;. &#160;</p><p>Historically, while a mid-systolic click and late-systolic murmur were described in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, their association with mitral regurgitation was first demonstrated by Barlow in 1963 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The relationship between the late systolic click-murmur and abnormal mitral motion was further characterized in a larger series of 90 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. MVP was subsequently linked to numerous symptoms and clinical syndromes, but many studies finding associations with MVP used variable and insufficiently stringent diagnostic criteria. In addition, many names have been used for MVP in the literature (click-murmur syndrome, Barlow&rsquo;s disease, myxomatous mitral valve disease, floppy mitral valve, etc), leading to further confusion. Diagnostic criteria for MVP have evolved from being based on physical examination (with auscultatory findings considered diagnostic even with a normal echocardiogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]) to including overbroad echocardiographic criteria (including findings on M-mode and in the four-chamber view) to the current criteria. </p><p>Since diagnostic criteria for MVP have evolved, the literature on MVP must be reviewed with care. Many studies of MVP have design flaws due to inadequate controls <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> insufficiently stringent criteria for MVP. In addition, patients previously misdiagnosed with MVP require appropriate evaluation and counseling. </p><p>There are multiple ways of classifying MVP, underscoring the heterogeneity of this disorder:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Etiologically, MVP is classified as primary (degenerative disease in the absence of identifiable connective tissue disease, sporadic, or familial) versus secondary MVP (associated with an identifiable disorder such as Marfan syndrome) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83655\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83655 \">table 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinically, MVP can be classified as syndromic when extra-cardiac manifestations are present (eg, pectus excavatum) versus non-syndromic, isolated MVP. The etiologies and mechanisms of regurgitation in various forms of MVP are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83655\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83655 \">table 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MVP is also classified by severity of the abnormal movement of the valve. The leaflets are described as billowing when the tips of leaflets remain in the left ventricle (LV) versus flail when the tip(s) of one (or both) leaflets prolapses into the left atrium (LA). &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Morphologically, MVP is classified as classic (also known as Barlow&rsquo;s syndrome with markedly and diffusely thickened leaflets [&ge;5 mm] with bileaflet prolapse) versus non-classic (with limited or absent thickening [thickness &lt;5mm] and segmental prolapse). (See <a href=\"#H28356921\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> below and <a href=\"#H28356780\" class=\"local\">'Primary MVP'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doppler echocardiography can also distinguish MVP without mitral regurgitation (MR) from MVP with MR. </p><p/><p>The 2014 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology guidelines for the management of patients with valvular heart disease separate mitral regurgitation by mechanism into primary (disease of one or more valve components including leaflets, chordae tendineae, papillary muscles, or annulus) and secondary (disease of the left ventricle) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In this classification, primary disease includes all forms of MVP along with other causes of MR involving the components of the valve (eg, calcific degeneration, cleft mitral valve, leaflet perforations, etc).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28356780\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY MVP</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28356796\"><span class=\"h2\">Sporadic primary MVP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is the most common cause of organic severe mitral regurgitation in the Western world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and is characterized by myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve leaflet(s) in the absence of a recognizable connective tissue disorder. The degree of involvement of the mitral valve leaflets and chords is variable, and results in a continuous spectrum of disease varying from &ldquo;classic&rdquo; to &ldquo;non-classic&rdquo; disease as described below. (See <a href=\"#H28356921\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> below.)</p><p>Primary MVP can be associated with other valvular abnormalities (tricuspid valve in up to 40 to 50 percent of patients, and aortic valve in 10 to 20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/10,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,21,22</a>], thoracic skeletal abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], von Willebrand syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and hypomastia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The latter two associations suggest that MVP may be related to a linked mesenchymal dysplasia, although hypomastia may also be a simple reflection of patients&rsquo; lean body habitus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28356823\"><span class=\"h2\">Familial primary MVP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While most of the cases of primary MVP are sporadic, familial cases have been identified since at least 1966 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The most common transmission pattern is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The prevalence in first degree relatives is relatively high, ranging from 30 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Three loci have been mapped to chromosomes 16, 11, and 13, but the underlying genetic defects are not currently known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>An X-linked recessive form seems to be related to filamin A mutations, and results in a rare form of multivalvular myxomatous degeneration (X-linked myxomatous valvular dystrophy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In affected males, this disease is characterized by myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve frequently associated with aortic valve degeneration. Female carriers can also exhibit valvular degeneration, but this is usually less severe.</p><p>Echocardiography is indicated for formal diagnosis in patients with a family history of MVP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28356838\"><span class=\"h1\">SECONDARY MVP</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28356854\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary MVP associated with connective tissue disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is more prevalent in patients with Marfan syndrome, MASS phenotype, Ehlers&ndash;Danlos syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, and pseudoxanthoma elasticum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/27,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,32</a>]. Among patients with Marfan syndrome, mitral valve prolapse occurs more frequently in patients with FBN1 mutations as compared to those with TGFBR2 mutations (eg, 45 and 21 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]).

Infective endocarditis causes destructive lesions, and ruptured chordae may ensue, leading to flail mitral leaflet(s). Myocardial ischemia is not a cause of MVP, but myocardial infarction with papillary muscle rupture causes one or both leaflets to prolapse in the left atrium (LA), often with a muscle tip attached. Similarly, blunt chest trauma with rupture of chordae or papillary muscle can cause a flail mitral leaflet. Acute rheumatic fever may cause prolapse by true elongation of the valvular tissue, but subsequent tissue retraction makes the occurrence of a prolapse due to chronic rheumatic heart disease exceptional unless there is a ruptured chord.</p><p>Other diseases, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myxomas, or prominent mitral annular calcifications, may also cause ruptured chordae and thereby cause leaflet prolapse. While mitral regurgitation in these cases is technically due to leaflet prolapse, the diagnosis is usually obvious from the clinical presentation and echocardiographic findings, and not associated with myxomatous degeneration of the leaflets. </p><p>MVP has also been found in as many as 15 percent of patients with Ebstein's anomaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Ebstein anomaly&quot;</a>.) This suggests a role for LV deformation in creating mitral imbalance and prolapse despite a structurally normal mitral valve.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28356921\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anatomically, the mitral valve is formed by a long and narrow anterior leaflet and a shorter and wider posterior leaflet occupying a larger portion of the annular circumference (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83654\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83654 \">figure 1</a>). Thus, when the mitral valve is closed, it appears from the atrial side as the &ldquo;mitral smile&rdquo; with two leaflets and two commissures (anterolateral and posteromedial). The leaflets&rsquo; bases are attached to the annulus and their tips to the chordae, which join the papillary muscles.</p><p>In primary and secondary mitral valve prolapse (MVP) associated with connective tissue disorders, the degenerative process may involve the entire mitral valvular complex (leaflets, chordae, mitral annulus). The hallmark macroscopic valvular lesion of MVP is excessive mitral leaflet tissue leading to folding and hooding. Depending on the extent of the myxomatous degeneration, one or more segments of one or both leaflets are affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. The chordae are elongated, have reduced strength, and may rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The annulus is typically dilated and frequently disjuncted from its normal myocardial support. In contrast, the papillary muscles are usually normal in structure. Physiologically, various combinations of the leaflet, chordal, and annular alterations yield insufficient apposition of the rough zones of the leaflets so they no longer support each other during systole and fall into the left atrium.</p><p>While there is great diversity of lesions, the macro-alterations of MVP are often grouped under two headings. At one end of the spectrum is &ldquo;classic&rdquo; (also known as Barlow&rsquo;s disease or diffuse myxomatous) MVP, characterized by thickened and diffusely redundant myxomatous leaflet tissue with prolapse of most of the leaflet segments, severe mitral annular enlargement, and elongated (rarely ruptured) chords (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83595\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83595 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83604%7ECARD%2F83605\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef83604 graphicRef83605 \">movie 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Mitral annular disjunction is an abnormality of the mitral annulus fibrosus resulting in a systolic gap between the insertion of the posterior mitral leaflet and the basal inferolateral myocardium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83606\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef83606 \">movie 2</a>). This disjunction commonly occurs in patients with advanced classic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>At the other end is &ldquo;non-classic&rdquo; disease known as fibroelastic deficiency first described by Carpentier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], which can be seen in up to 40 percent of patients requiring mitral valve repair. It usually affects individuals over the age of 60 and is characterized by involvement of a single segment (most commonly P2 scallop), with thin and somewhat redundant leaflets, ruptured chords, and mild mitral annular enlargement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83595\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83595 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83602%7ECARD%2F83603\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef83602 graphicRef83603 \">movie 3A-B</a>). The flail segment is thickened and myxomatous in a very localized manner. </p><p>Forme fruste Barlow&rsquo;s disease appears as an intermediate between classic and non-classic disease. It is important to make the distinction between various forms, as the complexity of surgical repair increases with the extent of mitral valve involvement by myxomatous degeneration. </p><p>Histologically, the characteristic myxomatous lesion is proliferation of the spongiosa of the mitral valve leaflets, with mucopolysaccharide deposits and excessive water content causing leaflet thickening and redundancy. The collagen composition is altered, with a marked increase in type III collagen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]; elastin fibers appear fragmented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Focal accumulation of activated valvular interstitial cells and increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases suggest that abnormal tissue remodeling is responsible for the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>Qualitative histological analysis cannot differentiate between Barlow&rsquo;s disease and fibroelastic deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, a more elaborate semiquantitative analysis shows different patterns, with more myxomatous infiltration, collagen proliferation, and elastic fiber lesions in Barlow&rsquo;s disease and Marfan syndrome than in fibroelastic deficiency. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28356936\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since symptoms do not reliably indicate mitral valve prolapse (MVP), the key clinical manifestations of MVP are auscultatory findings that lead to evaluation by echocardiography. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H406765\"><span class=\"h2\">MVP syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous nonspecific symptoms and signs such as chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, exercise intolerance, dizziness, anxiety disorders, and electrocardiographic abnormalities have been attributed to MVP. MVP syndrome has been defined as the combination of these symptoms and signs with mitral valve prolapse. However, the validity of MVP syndrome has been questioned since many reports of associations had flawed study designs (including inadequate control groups and use of insufficiently stringent diagnostic criteria for MVP). These issues are discussed in detail separately.

However, symptoms are not reliable indicators of MVP. Furthermore, symptoms frequently seen in individuals with MVP have not been conclusively determined to be more prevalent than in the general population. As an example, in a study of 147 patients referred for echocardiography for suspected MVP, the presence of symptoms was not associated with MVP on echocardiography (found in 22 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

The click is thought to be caused by snapping of the mitral chordae during systole when the valve bows into the atrium. The click is mobile, meaning its timing varies with maneuvers that change the left ventricular volume, occurring earlier in systole with sitting, standing, or other interventions that reduce ventricular size, or later with those interventions that increase chamber size such as squatting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57858\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef57858 \">movie 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80360\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef80360 \">movie 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. An MVP click should be differentiated from the aortic or pulmonary ejection clicks (occurring early in systole, at the foot of the carotid upstroke) and from other cardiac sounds (split first or second heart sounds, pericardial sounds, atrial septal aneurysm clicks). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-heart-sounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of heart sounds&quot;</a>.) </p><p>As noted above, most adults with MVP have mitral regurgitation (MR), but the majority of patients with MVP have mild, trace, or no MR, and severe MR is uncommon. (See <a href=\"#H28356738\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.) The murmur of mitral regurgitation with MVP is late-systolic early in the course of the disease, and its point of maximal intensity and radiation pattern varies with the direction of the jet (anteriorly-directed jets can be heard over the entire precordial area, while posteriorly directed jets are typically best heard at the apex and radiate towards the axilla and the back). Once a flail or severe prolapse occurs, the murmur becomes holosystolic and is indistinguishable in tone from other causes of mitral regurgitation, but often will remain maximum at mid-late systole. With long-standing severe mitral regurgitation, apical impulse is displaced laterally, and clinical findings of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (gallop sounds) and pulmonary hypertension (loud P2 component) can be found. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-and-pharmacologic-maneuvers-in-the-differential-diagnosis-of-heart-murmurs-and-sounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic and pharmacologic maneuvers in the differential diagnosis of heart murmurs and sounds&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With acute severe MR (as may result from chordal rupture), the cardiac impulse is hyperdynamic but normal in location unless there has been preceding chronic MR. The murmur of acute MR may be early systolic, midsystolic, or holosystolic and is generally soft and low pitched, ending before A2. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Limited data are available on the diagnostic accuracy of auscultation for MVP, particularly when limited to studies using current echocardiographic diagnostic criteria. Identification of a mobile systolic click by an expert observer may be a highly sensitive finding (88 and 100 percent) with fair specificity (66 and 73 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. In contrast, in a study of 147 patients referred for echocardiography for suspected MVP, identification of a systolic click by a referring physician had a sensitivity of 52 percent and specificity of 68 percent for MVP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Of note, auscultatory manifestations are highly variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. This, together with inconsistent clinical examination skills among physicians and variable auscultatory and echocardiographic criteria used to diagnose MVP, probably explains the conflicting observations on the accuracy of auscultatory findings in MVP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H406867\"><span class=\"h3\">Other physical examination findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observation of the general appearance and body habitus is usually the first step in the physical examination. Skeletal abnormalities found in patients with MVP include narrow anteroposterior chest diameter, scoliosis and loss of kyphosis of the thoracic spine, and pectus excavatum deformity, although the data on the frequency of MVP in patients with these abnormalities are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/23,24,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24,47</a>]. Patients with MVP tend to have a lower BMI index than controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28357003\"><span class=\"h1\">ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H407051\"><span class=\"h2\">M-mode</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>M-mode echocardiography should no longer be used in making a positive diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse (MVP).

Other 2D features associated with MVP are abnormalities in leaflet length, annular diameter (enlarged), and chordal length (elongated).</p><p>When surgical intervention is contemplated, knowledge of the detailed mitral valve anatomy is needed to effectively communicate the necessary information to the surgical team. The anatomical description of the mitral valve proposed by Carpentier (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83654\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83654 \">figure 1</a>) divides the posterior leaflet into anterolateral (P1), middle (P2), and postero-medial (P3) scallops. While the anterior leaflet does not have obvious anatomical divisions, corresponding segments are labeled similarly A1 to A3. Expert examination of the mitral valve at transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) enables determination of the location and extent of disease for pre-operative planning in up to 98 percent of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], although 2D and 3D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) provide superior delineation of the anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Intra-operative TEE is recommended for mitral valve cases; image quality is superior to TTE and allows detecting finer anatomic details (ruptured chords, more precise location of origin of mitral regurgitant jet). Information about the location, extent of disease, and origin(s) of the mitral regurgitant jet needs to be communicated to the surgical team for adequate planning. Surgical intervention for classic MVP is likely to involve a significantly more complex approach than needed for localized fibroelastic deficiency seen with non-classic MVP. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28357037\"><span class=\"h2\">3D echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of 3D technology, especially real time 3D-TEE, provides excellent rendering of the mitral valve complex. Live 3D-TEE has become routine in <span class=\"nowrap\">pre/intraoperative</span> imaging of the mitral valve and in percutaneous mitral valve interventions. 3D-TEE efficiently identifies correct location of prolapse and flail segments, and by reconstruction of the 3D image from the left atrial view (surgical view), information is easily communicated to the surgical team (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83654\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83654 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83603%7ECARD%2F83605\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef83603 graphicRef83605 \">movie 1B, 3B</a>). In a study comparing 2D TEE with 3D-TEE, both expert and less experienced echocardiographers more accurately described the mitral valve pathology using 3D-TEE (with surgical pathology as the reference), with less experienced interpreters gaining a significantly greater advantage from using 3D-TEE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. 3D-TEE is the key imaging modality for guidance of percutaneous mitral valve repair with the MitraClip system. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transcatheter-mitral-valve-repair\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transcatheter mitral valve repair&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With increased use of 3D-TEE, cleft-like indentations of the posterior mitral leaflet are more frequently recognized, and may be present in up to one-third of patients with myxomatous MVP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F102215\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef102215 \">movie 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Appropriate recognition of cleft-like indentation is important when planning surgical or percutaneous mitral valve repair. However, it must be emphasized that not all cleft-like indentations apparent on 3D reconstruction are associated with mitral regurgitation (ie, many are &quot;non-functional&quot; clefts, being visible only during diastole, which do not require repair). The best approach to determine the significance of cleft-like indentation is to examine the mitral valve anatomy from the left ventricular en-face view, in both 3D and 3D color. </p><p>3D-TEE also allows insights into the dynamic mitral annulus function, with early-systolic area contraction and saddle-shape deepening contributing to mitral competency. The mitral annulus in MVP is also dynamic but considerably different from normal patients, with loss of early-systolic area contraction and diminished saddle-shape deepening despite similar magnitude of ventricular contraction, suggestive of ventricular-annular decoupling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. With the rapid development of percutaneous interventions for mitral regurgitation, accurate assessment of the mitral valve anatomy (annulus area and perimeter, inter-commissural and septal-lateral diameters) becomes increasingly important. These can be reliably measured by both 3D echocardiography and computed tomography (CT).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28357056\"><span class=\"h2\">Doppler imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While 2D and 3D imaging techniques allow identification of anatomical substrate, Doppler echocardiographic techniques are key to estimating severity of MR.

These patients should be further evaluated by echocardiography.

The auscultatory findings of non-ejection clicks and systolic murmur are the initial observations leading to a diagnosis by echocardiography.
