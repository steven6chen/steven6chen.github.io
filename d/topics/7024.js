Falls usually occur in older adults with multiple impairments in cognitive, sensory, and gait domains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Falls are therefore very common among older adults who are cared for in institutional health care settings such as nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities, or acute hospitals.</p><p>Falls in institutional settings lead to functional decline, increased length of stay in acute care hospitals, and increased institutional liability. Much geriatric research has focused on strategies and interventions to prevent falling in the institutional environment.</p><p>This topic will address risk factors and prevention strategies for older patients in nursing homes and acute care facilities. A discussion of fall risks and prevention for community-dwelling older individuals is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls in older persons: Risk factors and patient evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls: Prevention in community-dwelling older persons&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H638009024\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compared with community dwellers, falls occur more commonly among patients in nursing home, rehabilitation, and acute hospital settings. Data vary regarding fall rates and number of patients who fall, and depend upon the particular patient population studied. Approximately 50 percent of individuals in the long-term care setting fall each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The average rate of falls in the nursing home is estimated to be 1.5 falls per nursing home bed annually (range: 0.2 to 3.5 falls per bed annually) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In the rehabilitation setting, rates may be higher for certain groups of patients. For instance, in the acute rehabilitation setting, fall rates for stroke patients have been reported as 3.4 falls per bed annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Certain groups of hospitalized patients are particularly vulnerable to falls; for example, 5 percent of inpatients with a recent ischemic stroke will fall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and nearly 10 percent of older adults admitted to a geriatric psychiatric unit will fall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Hospitalized patients with cancer are also at especially high fall risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17785891\"><span class=\"h2\">Morbidity and mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Falls that occur in nursing care facilities and acute hospital settings result in significant morbidity and mortality. As many as 5 percent of falls among nursing home residents result in a fracture, with an additional 2 percent of falls resulting in a serious injury requiring medical attention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In hospitalized older adults, approximately 1 percent of falls result in a fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and as many as 5 percent may result in a serious injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Persons experiencing a hip fracture during hospitalization have a greater risk of institutionalization and death compared with community dwellers experiencing a hip fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H727186354\"><span class=\"h2\">Institutional impact</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Falls are a common source of litigation and denial of insurance claims in nursing care facilities and the hospital setting. In 2001, 30 percent of lawsuits in the United States against nursing homes alleged that a potentially avoidable fall contributed to the injury under review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Medical expenses associated with inpatient falls are a particular concern: as of 2008, Medicare and many private payers do not reimburse institutions for complications or extended length of stay related to falls that occur in the institution. Some falls that occur in the hospital setting are not preventable, and the wisdom of this non-reimbursement policy has been called into question [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The estimated non-reimbursed hospital costs related to falls for 2008 to 2009 were 7.6 million dollars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. It is important that hospitals and other institutions avoid adopting ineffective or even harmful practices, such as increased use of restraints, in an effort to decrease their revenue losses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17785898\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for falls in the nursing home or hospital setting are generally similar to those in the community (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63126\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63126 \">figure 1</a>). Risk factors include older age, history of falls, cognitive impairment, dizziness or vertigo, environmental hazards, impaired mobility, certain medication use, and visual impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. A combination of these factors increases the fall risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H212880639\"><span class=\"h2\">Age and health status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased inpatient fall risk has been associated with older age and worse general health status. In a cohort of 9625 men who underwent an inpatient surgical procedure at a Veterans Affairs hospital, a postoperative fall was more likely in patients who were older, dependent in one or more activities of daily living, or had a higher American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) Score, indicating worse preoperative health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Common environmental hazards in the institutional health care setting include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wet floors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rooms overcrowded with furniture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improper toilet seat height or bed height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Floor type, with falls more likely with carpet flooring compared with vinyl flooring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21962697\"><span class=\"h2\">Impaired balance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several observational studies of falls in nursing home residents have found an increased risk of fall in patients with gait disorders or weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/4,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,20</a>]. In one review of four studies (1076 falls), gait disorders or weakness was found to be the most likely cause (25 percent) of falling; dizziness was also reported by a quarter of patients who have fallen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, a majority of falls resulted from a combination of intrinsic risk factors and situational or environmental hazards.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21962710\"><span class=\"h2\">Medication use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medication use may be one of the most common and modifiable risk factors for falls, although it is difficult for observational studies to separate the effects of the medication from the underlying medical condition (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-prescribing-for-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug prescribing for older adults&quot;</a>). Medications with activity directed at the central nervous system, such as neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and other sedatives (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolpidem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zolpidem</a>) appear to be associated with an increased risk of falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. A meta-analysis of 70 studies evaluating the relationship between psychotropic medication use and falls includes 17 studies that were conducted in the nursing home or rehabilitation setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The risk of falls was increased among users of antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and other sedatives (odds ratio [OR] 1.5 to 1.7).</p><p>There is no evidence that the newer psychotropic agents are less likely to cause falls. A retrospective cohort study of 2428 nursing home residents found no difference in the risk of falls among users of the newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants versus traditional tricyclic antidepressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Similarly, a prospective cohort of 2005 nursing home residents in Australia found little difference in the risk of falls among users of the newer antipsychotics versus the traditional antipsychotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Use of the newer sedatives (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolpidem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zolpidem</a>) has also been associated with an elevated risk of falls or injurious falls in the hospital and nursing home settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/25,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,30</a>]. Similarly, it is not clear that one class of psychotropic agents is safer than another with respect to falls risk. In a comparative effectiveness study of antidepressants and antipsychotics to treat nursing home residents with dementia and behavioral problems, there was no significant difference between the rate of falls in the two classes of medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Other classes of medications that have been associated with an increased risk of falls include vasodilators, diuretics, beta-blockers, and diabetic medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/16,20,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20,32</a>].</p><p>Recent changes in medication dosages or new medications, particularly benzodiazepines, may also be an important risk factor for falls in the nursing home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17785913\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING FOR FALL RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple falls risk screening tools have been proposed for use in the acute hospital setting including the Morse Fall Scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], Hendrich II Fall Risk Model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], Schmid Fall Risk Assessment Tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], Johns Hopkins Hospital Fall Risk Assessment Tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], and St. Thomas&rsquo;s Risk Assessment Tool (STRATIFY) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The Morse Fall Scale, one of the more commonly used scales, is comprised of six items: history of falling in past three months, presence of any secondary diagnosis, use of an ambulatory aid, receipt of intravenous therapy, abnormal gait, and impaired mental status, with composite scores ranging from 0 to 125 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F77876\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77876 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>A meta-analysis comparing the sensitivity and specificity of the Morse Fall Scale and STRATIFY found that, using a cutpoint of &gt;45, the Morse Fall Scale had superior sensitivity; the specificity was similar for the two scales [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. An inter-rater reliability study found that both the Morse Fall Scale (with a cutpoint of &gt;25) and the Hendrich II Fall Risk Model (with a cutpoint of 5) had similar sensitivity (&gt;0.70), whereas the Hendrich II exhibited superior specificity (0.62 versus 0.48) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. One study found that a falls risk assessment tool (STRATIFY) was not helpful in predicting fractures after falls, but that the FRAX tool was useful for that purpose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Fracture risk assessment tool'</a>.)</p><p>A study of 5129 nursing home residents from 13 facilities found a modest improvement in the identification of residents at risk for falls when information from the electronic health record (EHR) was added to the Minimum Data Set. However, overall prediction was still moderate (28.6 percent of observed falls occurred among residents in the highest projected risk decile versus 32.3 percent when EHR data was added) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. A small study from the United Kingdom found that a tool combining demographics and resident characteristics with measures of gait and balance performed well in predicting falls in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Despite the relatively good performance of these tools in predicting falls, a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies suggests that falls screening tools are comparable with nursing clinical judgment when predicting falls in the acute hospital setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Screening tools may be even less useful in the nursing home setting, where the majority of residents are likely to be at high fall risk. A prospective cohort study of 183 nursing home residents in Sweden found that both the staff&rsquo;s judgment of fall risk and a prior history of falls were better predictors of future falls than commonly used screening tests for falls, such as the Get Up And Go test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Rather than implement falls screening, all nursing home residents should be considered at high risk for falls.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17785920\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION STRATEGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two systematic reviews of studies of fall prevention in hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>] and long-term care facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] found inconclusive evidence for the effectiveness of most approaches. Fall prevention in the setting of a long-term care facility may be particularly challenging, as most interventions have not been demonstrated to be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. A meta-analysis of interventions to prevent falls in nursing homes found little evidence for efficacy except with regard to the prevention of recurrent falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

The results may be affected by heterogeneity between trials including differences in comparators (usual care or placebo), doses of vitamin D, and in primary outcomes (fracture or fall). Another meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials of vitamin D supplementation for fall prevention included five trials in patients in a variety of institutional settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].

In the overall meta-analysis, vitamin D, in varying doses between trials, reduced the relative risk of falling in hospitalized or institutionalized patients 80 years and older (RR 0.90, 95% 0.80-1.01), although the finding did not reach statistical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p>Inconsistent results of vitamin D trials in the nursing home may relate to insufficient dosing. A randomized placebo control trial of vitamin D supplementation in nursing home residents found that only higher doses of vitamin D were associated with a decreased risk of falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. In this study, 124 nursing home residents were randomly assigned to receive vitamin D (200, 400, 600, or 800international units) or placebo daily for five months. The rate of falls was reduced in the group taking 800 international units, with no difference in the rate of falls among the placebo group and those taking lower doses of vitamin D.</p><p>The American Geriatrics Society panel review of data regarding vitamin D suggested that many older adults will need higher supplementation levels (eg, at least 1000 international units daily) to achieve 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels sufficient for falls and fracture prevention, and that this dose allows for a wide safety margin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>].

One study of 263,068 nursing home residents evaluated the effect of physical restraints (full bed rails on all open sides of bed, half rail one side, trunk restraint, limb restraint, or chairs to prevent rising) on falls and other adverse health outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. After adjustment for factors other than restraints that might impact fall risk, a slight increased risk of falls was found among residents who were physically restrained. There was also a reduction in walking dependence and an increase in pressure ulcers and contractures among those who were physically restrained. An increased risk of falls among nursing home residents who were physically restrained, compared with those without restraints, was also demonstrated in additional studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>].</p><p>A time series conducted in two post-stroke and brain injury rehabilitation units suggested that removal of physical restraints may be associated with a decreased rate of falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Falls were also decreased in the nursing home setting with an intervention that led to a decrease in the use of restrictive bedside rails [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p>The utility of bed and chair alarms in reducing falls in the nursing home setting is not established, although these devices are widely used. Alarm use leads to &ldquo;false positive&rdquo; signals that can be annoying to the resident and difficult for staff to interpret.
