This was at a time when the diagnosis of hypothyroidism was based upon symptoms and signs, and sometimes serum cholesterol measurements, rather than measurements of serum thyroxine (T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). In some cases, a high serum cholesterol concentration was regarded as evidence for &quot;premyxoedema&quot; in the absence of symptoms of hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. How many of these patients in fact had hypothyroidism is not known. While there is no doubt that many hypothyroid patients have abnormal serum lipid concentrations, the increased risk of coronary artery disease seen in hypothyroid patients is likely multifactorial in etiology.

However, in a study using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to assess lipid subparticle concentrations, hypothyroid women had a shift toward less atherogenic large LDL, small very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and large HDL subparticle sizes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of T4 therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Changes in serum lipoprotein(a) concentrations in hypothyroidism and during T4 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>) therapy have also varied.

A decrease in LDL receptor activity has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The extent of upregulation of the LDL receptor by T4 therapy varies considerably in patients with different polymorphisms of the LDL receptor gene.

Of these 4349 patients, 3.5 percent (151) had a serum TSH of 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/L</span> and 1.7 percent (74) had a TSH greater than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/L</span>. In another study of 248 patients referred to a lipid disorders clinic, 2.8 percent had overt hypothyroidism and 4.4 percent had subclinical hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Thus, all patients with hypercholesterolemia (and hypertriglyceridemia) should be screened for hypothyroidism (and other secondary causes of hyperlipidemia) before being given specific lipid-lowering drug therapy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of and screening for hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;, section on 'Candidates for screening'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-causes-of-dyslipidemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary causes of dyslipidemia&quot;</a>).

The effects of T4 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>) treatment on patients with subclinical hypothyroidism were similar in two randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/38,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,41</a>] and two reviews of the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/18,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,37</a>]: a mean reduction in serum total cholesterol of 9 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.2 to 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and in LDL cholesterol of 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/18,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,37</a>].
