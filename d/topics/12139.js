The choice of procedures depends upon the indication for operative intervention and the location(s) of the disease (small bowel versus colorectal).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60220165\"><span class=\"h2\">Perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emergency surgery is required to control sepsis or peritonitis resulting from a bowel perforation. In 1 to 16 percent of patients undergoing surgery for Crohn disease, bowel perforation was the main indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-crohn-disease-of-the-small-bowel-colon-and-rectum/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Patients with a free perforation of the small bowel or colon should undergo immediate surgical resection of the perforated segment. Following bowel resection, a primary anastomosis may or may not be constructed depending upon the clinical situation. (See <a href=\"#H442515003\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel resection'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1038704594\" class=\"local\">'Colorectal resection'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients who are hemodynamically unstable, who have edematous bowels, significant intra-abdominal contamination from the perforation, or other risk factors (eg, malnutrition or chronic glucocorticoid use), should have a diverting stoma rather than a primary anastomosis. Stable patients without the above risk factors may undergo primary bowel anastomosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4011010630\"><span class=\"h2\">Abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with an intra-abdominal abscess resulting from Crohn disease should receive antibiotic treatment and either percutaneous or surgical drainage of the abscess, followed by surgical resection of the involved bowel segment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abscess drainage</strong> &mdash; Percutaneous drainage is the preferred treatment for intra-abdominal abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-crohn-disease-of-the-small-bowel-colon-and-rectum/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A surgical drainage procedure is performed if percutaneous drainage is not feasible or fails to control the sepsis. Percutaneous drainage can be performed transgluteally or transabdominally depending upon the location of the abscess. It may be repeated as necessary for any residual or recurrent collections. In contemporary practice, approximately 70 percent of Crohn-related abscesses are managed with percutaneous drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-crohn-disease-of-the-small-bowel-colon-and-rectum/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Successful percutaneous drainage of the abscess resolves the intra-abdominal sepsis, after which the involved bowel segment can be resected in a clean rather than contaminated operation. Percutaneous drainage also permits the patient's nutritional status to be improved prior to surgery and decreases their glucocorticoid use perioperatively. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Abdominal wall abscesses involving the rectus sheath and retroperitoneal abscesses involving the psoas muscle are less common but more difficult to control than intra-abdominal abscesses. In a retrospective review, all 13 abdominal wall abscesses eventually required surgical drainage after multiple failed attempts of percutaneous drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-crohn-disease-of-the-small-bowel-colon-and-rectum/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bowel resection</strong> &mdash; Following the resolution of an intra-abdominal abscess, the involved bowel segment is typically resected, or else at least 30 percent of patients will develop recurrent abscesses or other symptoms. Patients with long-segment disease, however, may be managed medically to avoid postsurgical complications such as diarrhea or even short bowel syndrome. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The optimal timing of bowel resection should be determined individually for each patient. Most surgeons wait five to seven days after a successful percutaneous drainage before operating to allow local sepsis associated with the abscess to resolve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-crohn-disease-of-the-small-bowel-colon-and-rectum/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For those undergoing surgical drainage of an abscess, whether or not to perform a concomitant bowel resection is determined by operative findings and the patient's condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-crohn-disease-of-the-small-bowel-colon-and-rectum/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patients who are dependent on glucocorticoids preoperatively should not undergo concomitant bowel resection with abscess drainage because of a high risk of anastomotic complications. In a retrospective review of 173 patients undergoing ileocecal or ileocolic resection for Crohn disease, preoperative glucocorticoid use (odds ratio [OR] 2.67, 95% CI 1.0-7.2) and intra-abdominal abscess (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.2-9.8) were two independent predictors of anastomotic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-crohn-disease-of-the-small-bowel-colon-and-rectum/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Patients with both risk factors developed significantly more anastomotic complications than those who only had an abscess (40 versus 14 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although preoperative use of biologic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>) has also been shown to negatively impact postoperative outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-crohn-disease-of-the-small-bowel-colon-and-rectum/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], its influence on intraoperative decision-making has not been studied and remains controversial.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H701206499\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with Crohn disease often have guaiac-positive stools. Gross gastrointestinal bleeding is usually seen in those with Crohn colitis. Hemodynamically stable patients with significant gastrointestinal bleeding from Crohn disease may be managed endoscopically or angiographically. Unstable patients require urgent bowel resection, the extent of which is determined by whether the bleeding can be localized to a specific bowel segment. (See <a href=\"#H442515003\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel resection'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1038704594\" class=\"local\">'Colorectal resection'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H150648706\"><span class=\"h2\">Stricture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The transmural inflammatory process that characterizes Crohn disease often results in fibrotic strictures that can lead to bowel obstruction. A symptomatic small bowel or colorectal stricture can be managed with endoscopic dilatation, strictureplasty, or surgical resection, the choice of which depends upon the stricture's location (small bowel versus colorectal) and length.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2928369725\"><span class=\"h3\">Small bowel stricture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small bowel strictures respond to endoscopic dilatation, strictureplasty, or surgical resection. The best approach is chosen based upon a stricture's length and complexity as well as the patient's intestinal reserve:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal, short-segment (&lt;5 cm) small bowel strictures that are not associated with any complications (eg, perforation, abscess, fistula, or malignancy) can be treated with endoscopic dilatation, provided that the location of the stricture is accessible to endoscopic intervention, or with surgical resection or strictureplasty. (See <a href=\"#H3884850\" class=\"local\">'Balloon dilatation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H442515003\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel resection'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3884843\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel strictureplasty'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long (&ge;5 cm), multifocal, complicated strictures and strictures that failed endoscopic therapy require surgical treatment:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Strictureplasty is preferred in patients with diffuse or recurrent strictures, especially in those with existing or impending short bowel syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H3884843\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel strictureplasty'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Small bowel resection is preferred to treat strictures complicated by perforation, abscess, fistula, or malignancy as well as multiple strictures within a short segment of the bowel. (See <a href=\"#H442515003\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel resection'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3482169646\"><span class=\"h3\">Colorectal stricture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colorectal strictures that are associated with an anastomosis are typically treated with endoscopic dilatation. Other Crohn-related colorectal strictures are treated with surgical resection. Strictureplasty is not usually performed for colorectal strictures. (See <a href=\"#H1038704594\" class=\"local\">'Colorectal resection'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H430400113\"><span class=\"h2\">Fistula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transmural bowel inflammation is associated with the development of sinus tracts. Sinus tracts that penetrate the serosa can give rise to fistulas. In patients with Crohn disease, enteric fistulas most often connect the intestine to the bladder (enterovesical), skin (enterocutaneous), bowel (enteroenteric), or vagina (enterovaginal). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-medical-management-of-high-risk-adult-patients-with-moderate-to-severe-crohn-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of medical management of high-risk, adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with an enteric fistula refractory to medical therapy require resection of the involved bowel segment and oversewing of the fistulous opening into the adjacent organ. Resection of the adjacent organ is not necessary unless that organ is also affected by Crohn disease. Intestinal bypass should be avoided because persistent disease in the bypassed segment can lead to complications such as abscess formation, bleeding, perforation, bacterial overgrowth, or malignancy. (See <a href=\"#H442515003\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel resection'</a> below.)</p><p>Crohn disease also causes perianal fistulas, which are treated differently from enteric fistulas. Perianal fistulas related to Crohn disease are discussed in another topic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perianal complications of Crohn disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H354003990\"><span class=\"h2\">Neoplasm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Longstanding chronic inflammation associated with Crohn disease can cause intestinal mucosa to undergo malignant transformation. Suspicion of a malignant stricture or fistula in patients with Crohn disease should prompt a resection of the bowel segment including the lesion instead of a strictureplasty or intestinal bypass. (See <a href=\"#H442515003\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel resection'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3884843\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel strictureplasty'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with Crohn disease are more likely to develop malignant or premalignant lesions of the colon or rectum than of the small bowel. Such lesions include cancer, dysplasia-associated lesion or mass (DALM), high-grade dysplasia, or multifocal low-grade dysplasia. Patients with longstanding Crohn disease should undergo regular colonoscopic surveillance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surveillance-and-management-of-dysplasia-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H2089418339\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surveillance and management of dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Crohn disease'</a>.). Once a target lesion is identified and the diagnosis confirmed with biopsy, surgical resection is indicated, typically in the form of a total proctocolectomy. (See <a href=\"#H1038704594\" class=\"local\">'Colorectal resection'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H746690605\"><span class=\"h2\">Intractability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although Crohn disease is most often treated medically, patients may require operative intervention if they do not respond to, develop complications from, or are noncompliant with medical therapy. The choice of the operative intervention is dictated by the location of the disease (small bowel versus colorectal). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-medical-management-of-high-risk-adult-patients-with-moderate-to-severe-crohn-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of medical management of high-risk, adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3724156062\"><span class=\"h3\">Small bowel disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with medically refractory Crohn enteritis typically require small bowel resection because strictureplasty and endoscopic dilation are contraindicated in the presence of active inflammation. (See <a href=\"#H442515003\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel resection'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2021591163\"><span class=\"h3\">Colorectal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who develop acute fulminant colitis or toxic megacolon due to Crohn disease require urgent surgery to prevent sepsis, perforation, or death. A total colectomy with end ileostomy is the procedure of choice in this life-threatening situation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxic-megacolon#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxic megacolon&quot;, section on 'Surgery'</a>.). </p><p>Surgical management of Crohn colitis or proctitis with a less acute presentation depends upon the location of the disease: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with Crohn colitis, both segmental colectomy and total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis are effective treatments. The choice depends upon the focality of the disease. (See <a href=\"#H51116611\" class=\"local\">'Colectomy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with Crohn disease confined to the anorectum and the perineum, a complete proctectomy with an intersphincteric approach is the surgical treatment of choice. (See <a href=\"#H1634678810\" class=\"local\">'Proctectomy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with Crohn disease involving both the colon and rectum, a total proctocolectomy with end ileostomy is required. A restorative procedure, such as the ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA), should generally <strong>not</strong> be performed because of a high risk of pouch failure and disease recurrence in the pouch. (See <a href=\"#H968551329\" class=\"local\">'Proctocolectomy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1795561719\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth retardation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Crohn disease starts during childhood or adolescence in up to 20 percent of patients, 10 to 40 percent of whom have growth impairment due to chronic intestinal inflammation. Prepubertal patients with Crohn disease require surgery, most commonly bowel resection, if they have growth retardation despite medical therapy.

Although some patients may require <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN) due to prolonged intolerance of oral nutrition, long-term preoperative TPN should be avoided. In patients with fistulizing disease, the exclusive use of enteral nutrition has been shown to reduce postoperative septic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-crohn-disease-of-the-small-bowel-colon-and-rectum/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Most immunosuppressive drugs can be discontinued just before surgery without negative sequelae. In patients who can tolerate it, however, early discontinuation of immunosuppressive drugs allows time for the serum levels to decrease, which may improve surgical outcomes. Glucocorticoids need to be continued and gradually tapered after surgery.

In some studies, preoperative use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> did not increase postoperative complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-crohn-disease-of-the-small-bowel-colon-and-rectum/abstract/13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-18</a>].

An ileocecal resection is performed when the terminal ileum is involved with Crohn disease. In patients with short-segment stricturing or fistulizing disease, bowel resection is the most efficient way to restore health and improve quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-crohn-disease-of-the-small-bowel-colon-and-rectum/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H379061588\"><span class=\"h3\">Margins of resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because Crohn disease often recurs, bowel resection should be performed with the goal of preserving as much bowel as possible. Gross inspection, rather than histopathology, should determine resection margins since microscopic disease at the margins has <strong>not</strong> been associated with an increased risk of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-crohn-disease-of-the-small-bowel-colon-and-rectum/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

When necessary, intraoperative enteroscopy can be used to assess the bowel lumen for stricture or ulcerative disease that may be involved in resection margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-crohn-disease-of-the-small-bowel-colon-and-rectum/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2962829267\"><span class=\"h3\">Anastomotic technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following a bowel resection, the type of anastomosis (eg, side-to-side or end-to-end) performed is determined by surgeon preference as one type of anastomosis has not been conclusively shown to be superior to another based on available data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-crohn-disease-of-the-small-bowel-colon-and-rectum/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>Some surgeons prefer the side-to-side anastomosis because it generates a wider opening than an end-to-end or end-to-side anastomosis, which in theory would prevent anastomotic leaks or recurrent strictures. In one meta-analysis of bowel resections performed for Crohn disease, a side-to-side anastomosis was associated with fewer anastomotic leaks (odds ratio [OR] 4.4), postoperative complications (OR 2.6), and a shorter hospital stay (by 2.8 days) compared with an end-to-end anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-crohn-disease-of-the-small-bowel-colon-and-rectum/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

The bowel stumps are first reinforced with absorbable sutures, then sutured together to create a common support column, a unique feature of this technique. Bowels on both sides of the center support column are then opened longitudinally at the antimesenteric border starting at 1 cm from the support column. The longitudinal incisions are then hand-sewn closed transversely using absorbable sutures in a single-layer manner to complete the anastomosis. In the completed anastomosis, the support column is positioned between the anastomosis and the mesentery. The potential advantage of this anastomotic configuration is the ability to maintain intestinal diameter and thus prevent distortion or stenosis associated with recurrent strictures, which usually start from the mesenteric side of the lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-crohn-disease-of-the-small-bowel-colon-and-rectum/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H442515018\"><span class=\"h3\">Laparoscopic versus open approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopic bowel resection has been increasingly used to treat patients with Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-crohn-disease-of-the-small-bowel-colon-and-rectum/abstract/40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-44</a>], including those who develop recurrent disease after open surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-crohn-disease-of-the-small-bowel-colon-and-rectum/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

Thus, a laparoscopic approach to bowel resection is preferred when the appropriate expertise is available. </p><p>The benefits of laparoscopic surgery are best illustrated by a large retrospective study of 1917 patients who underwent ileocolonic resection for Crohn disease.

Operative management is reserved for those who develop complications (eg, perforation, abscess, fistula, hemorrhage, stricture, fistula, or neoplasm) or have persistent symptoms despite best medical management. In children and adolescents, growth retardation is another indication for operative intervention. (See <a href=\"#H1212154\" class=\"local\">'Indications for operative management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with Crohn disease who have bowel perforation, hemorrhage, fistula, neoplasm, or severe inflammation refractory to medical therapy and children who have growth retardation require surgical resection of the bowel segment(s). The resection technique depends upon the disease location (small bowel versus colorectal). (See <a href=\"#H60220165\" class=\"local\">'Perforation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H701206499\" class=\"local\">'Hemorrhage'</a> above and <a href=\"#H430400113\" class=\"local\">'Fistula'</a> above and <a href=\"#H354003990\" class=\"local\">'Neoplasm'</a> above and <a href=\"#H746690605\" class=\"local\">'Intractability'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1795561719\" class=\"local\">'Growth retardation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H442515003\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel resection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1038704594\" class=\"local\">'Colorectal resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Small bowel resection for Crohn disease can be performed open or laparoscopically. A laparoscopic approach is preferred to open surgery whenever appropriate expertise is available. Gross inspection, rather than histopathology, should determine resection margins. The anastomotic technique (eg, side-to-side, end-to-end) is determined by surgeon preference. (See <a href=\"#H442515003\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Resection techniques used to treat Crohn colitis or proctitis include segmental colectomy, total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis, total proctocolectomy with end ileostomy, and proctectomy. The choice depends upon the location of the disease and the indication for surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1038704594\" class=\"local\">'Colorectal resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an intra-abdominal abscess should be treated with antibiotics and undergo percutaneous or surgical drainage of the abscess, followed by surgical resection of the involved bowel segment after the resolution of sepsis. Percutaneous drainage is preferred to surgical drainage whenever possible. (See <a href=\"#H4011010630\" class=\"local\">'Abscess'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a small bowel stricture can be treated with endoscopic dilatation, small bowel strictureplasty, or small bowel resection. The choice depends upon the stricture's length and complexity as well as the patient's intestinal reserve. (See <a href=\"#H150648706\" class=\"local\">'Stricture'</a> above and <a href=\"#H442515003\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel resection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3884843\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel strictureplasty'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3884850\" class=\"local\">'Balloon dilatation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Endoscopic balloon dilatation is effective against short (&lt;5 cm) strictures, but most patients develop recurrent diseases that may ultimately require surgery. (See <a href=\"#H3884850\" class=\"local\">'Balloon dilatation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Small bowel strictureplasty is an effective treatment for chronic intestinal stricture without active inflammation. It is most commonly used in patients with existing or impending short bowel syndrome. Conventional strictureplasty techniques (eg, Heineke-Mikulicz or Finney) are used for focal and short strictures; more extensive strictures or multiple sequential strictures occurring over a long intestinal segment require a side-to-side isoperistaltic strictureplasty. (See <a href=\"#H3884843\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel strictureplasty'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Small bowel resection is preferred to treat strictures complicated by perforation, abscess, fistula, or malignancy as well as multiple strictures within a short segment of the bowel. (See <a href=\"#H442515003\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anastomotic colorectal strictures can be treated with endoscopic dilatation. Other Crohn-related strictures of the colon or rectum are best treated with surgical resection. Strictureplasty of the colon is not usually performed. (See <a href=\"#H3482169646\" class=\"local\">'Colorectal stricture'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1038704594\" class=\"local\">'Colorectal resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p><strong>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</strong>&mdash;The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Jacques Heppell, MD, FRCSC, FASCRS, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-crohn-disease-of-the-small-bowel-colon-and-rectum/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Strong S, Steele SR, Boutrous M, et al.
