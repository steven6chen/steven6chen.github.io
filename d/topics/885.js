Patients with chronic spinal cord dysfunction often require anesthesia for urologic, orthopedic, and plastic surgical procedures.</p><p>For the purpose of this discussion, chronic injury will be defined as the condition beyond several weeks after injury.</p><p>This topic discusses the anesthetic management of patients with chronic SCI. Anesthesia for patients with acute SCI and the chronic complications of patients with SCI are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for adults with acute spinal cord injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of spinal cord injury and disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1843153\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A medical history and anesthesia-directed physical examination should be performed for all patients who undergo anesthesia. For these patients, we focus the evaluation on the diverse systemic complications that can occur with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) and that can affect anesthetic management.</p><p>Chronic complications of SCI of particular concern for anesthesia are discussed here; other complications are discussed more fully separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of spinal cord injury and disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65968435\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular complications</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1843177\"><span class=\"h3\">Autonomic dysreflexia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with high SCI are at risk for autonomic dysreflexia (AD) and may require deep general anesthesia or regional anesthesia, even without sensory function at the surgical site. (See <a href=\"#H747703523\" class=\"local\">'Management of intraoperative autonomic dysreflexia'</a> below.)</p><p>Occurring in 20 to 70 percent of patients with SCI above T6, AD is an exaggerated sympathetic response to a stimulus below the SCI level. AD is manifested by diffuse vasoconstriction below the level of SCI and hypertension producing headache, diaphoresis, brady- or tachycardia, and other symptoms. The noxious stimulus is most commonly a distended viscus, usually the bladder; however, constipation, pain from pressure sores, and other stimuli may be problematic in some patients. SCI lesions lower than T6 do not produce this complication. AD is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of spinal cord injury and disease&quot;, section on 'Autonomic dysreflexia'</a>.)</p><p>A history of AD episodes should be sought preoperatively, including inciting events, treatment regimens, and prior surgical and anesthesia histories.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65968442\"><span class=\"h3\">Coronary artery disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) are more prevalent in patients with chronic SCI, and the prevalence of CAD is 3 to 10 times higher in patients with SCI compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, patients with high SCI may exhibit atypical chest pain or other symptoms as a result of cardiac ischemia. Therefore, SCI should lower the threshold to perform preoperative pharmacologic stress testing, especially before major surgery, and these patients should have appropriately aggressive individualized diagnostic workup.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65968488\"><span class=\"h3\">Others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The autonomic dysfunction that results from SCI disrupts normal cardiovascular homeostasis, separate from AD. In patients with SCI above T6, baseline blood pressure (BP) is usually reduced, and baseline heart rate (HR) may be as low as 50 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span> (bpm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In addition, these patients are often hypovolemic, and approximately 50 percent are anemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>A reduction in the dose of anesthetic agents <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> administration of vasoactive medication may be required to avoid hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Orthostatic hypotension may persist beyond the acute injury phase; these patients may not tolerate quick changes in position during surgery or the head-up position for preoxygenation prior to airway management.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Autonomic dysfunction also results in impaired thermoregulation. Patients are at risk for hypothermia, or for hyperthermia with the use of warming devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65968522\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical and high thoracic SCI affect respiratory muscles. The likelihood of pulmonary complications depends on the level and completeness of SCI, with a greater risk in persons with higher and neurologically more complete SCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

A survey study of men at least one year after SCI reported that increasing body mass index (BMI) and longer time since injury were associated with decreases in all measured lung volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These patients may desaturate quickly with apnea during induction of anesthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Assisted ventilation</strong> &ndash; Patients who retain adequate bulbar function after SCI may require a variety of assisted ventilation techniques, including noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (PPV), mechanical cough assist, glossopharyngeal breathing, and abdominal respirators. A plan for the perioperative management of these devices should be made in advance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury#H689401\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory complications in the adult patient with chronic spinal cord injury&quot;, section on 'Cervical cord injury with intact bulbar function'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with an intact phrenic nerve, either phrenic nerve pacing or percutaneous diaphragmatic pacing may allow independence from a ventilator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Perioperative management of these devices should be coordinated with the physician managing the device.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The specific methods of assisted ventilation must be considered when planning airway management, emergence from anesthesia, and postoperative care.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65968529\"><span class=\"h2\">Musculoskeletal complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contractures are common after SCI and can complicate positioning for surgery.

Patients should be examined preoperatively for signs of existing or impending skin breakdown, with particular attention to bony prominences. Patients should be positioned and moved carefully, with adequate padding, avoiding shear forces, friction, and wet linens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of spinal cord injury and disease&quot;, section on 'Pressure ulcers'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65968600\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A significant number of patients develop a chronic pain syndrome several months to years after SCI.

In particular, decreased range of neck motion may make direct laryngoscopy more difficult. Alternative devices for endotracheal intubation should be readily available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-general-anesthesia-in-adults#H3743067273\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Planning the airway management approach'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1843421\"><span class=\"h1\">ANESTHESIA MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65968679\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of anesthetic technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of anesthetic technique depends on the level of spinal cord injury (SCI), remaining sensory function, and the surgical procedure. Many patients with chronic SCI undergo anesthesia repeatedly; they often have a preference and know what has worked well in the past. In particular, both general and spinal anesthesia can effectively prevent autonomic dysreflexia (AD) in response to surgery.</p><p>General anesthesia may be preferable for patients who cannot tolerate lying flat, who have upper extremity muscle spasms, contractures that make positioning difficult, or high anxiety.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients at risk for, or with a history of, AD, or for those with lower extremity muscle spasms, either general or regional anesthesia may be used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients without sensation at the surgical site and who are not at risk for AD (ie, SCI below T6 and no history of AD), monitored anesthesia care with or without sedation is an option.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with incomplete sensory loss without risk for AD or spasms, local anesthesia or peripheral nerve block may be adequate for surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2362079868\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, monitoring for anesthesia for patients with chronic SCI should be performed as it would be for patients without SCI, determined by the surgical procedure and other comorbidities.</p><p>Continuous intraarterial pressure monitoring may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe AD, allowing immediate response to hemodynamic changes, and the use of potent vasodilators.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4002591896\"><span class=\"h2\">Premedication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with high SCI may be more sensitive to sedative medications than those without SCI. We do not routinely premedicate these patients with sedatives, and when we do, we titrate the dose to effect (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>, 0.5-mg intravenous [IV] increments).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4155001245\"><span class=\"h2\">General anesthesia</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3473309256\"><span class=\"h3\">Induction of anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Induction of anesthesia with IV medication is appropriate for most adults who require general anesthesia. Rarely, induction is performed with inhalation of a volatile anesthetic. Choice of induction agents relates to the plan for airway management, as well as other patient factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4087094569\"><span class=\"h4\">Induction agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of induction agent for general anesthesia is determined by factors other than the patient's SCI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-intravenous-induction-agents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Intravenous induction agents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, patients with thoracic and cervical SCI are more sensitive to induction agents than non-injured patients and are at risk for hypotension with induction of anesthesia, which may be a result of direct effects of induction agents, hypovolemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], reduced muscle mass, and reduced sympathetic and baroreceptor activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. We administer a fluid bolus prior to induction of anesthesia (500 to 1000 mL Ringer's lactate) and reduce the dose of induction agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-intravenous-induction-agents#H4070595924\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Intravenous induction agents&quot;, section on 'Dosing considerations'</a>.)</p><p>We connect a vasopressor infusion to the IV line and often start a low dose (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> 20 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/minute)</span> prior to or with induction as prophylaxis for hypotension if the patient is not bradycardic, as phenylephrine usually causes reflex bradycardia. For bradycardic patients, we often administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a> 5 to 15 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycopyrrolate</a> 0.2 to 0.4 mg IV with or without phenylephrine to prevent hypotension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H536088557\"><span class=\"h4\">Neuromuscular blocking agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We avoid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> in patients with SCI that has been present longer than 48 hours. Alternatives to succinylcholine include nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) or intubation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">remifentanil</a>. The choice of NMBA may be affected by neuromonitoring for spine surgery.

The choice of airway management device should be made as it would be for non-injured patients.</p><p>If the patient has a tracheostomy, a cuffed tracheostomy device should be used, or the device should be replaced with a flexible cuffed endotracheal tube (ETT) inserted directly into the stoma.

A processed electroencephalogram&nbsp;(EEG) monitor to help guide the dose of anesthetic agents may be useful if the anesthetic concentration is significantly below the level typically considered safe to prevent awareness (eg, 0.7 to 0.8 minimum alveolar concentration [MAC]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1264030340\"><span class=\"h3\">Emergence from anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After general anesthesia, NMBAs should be fully reversed, documented by a peripheral nerve stimulator. Patients with high SCI should be fully awake with adequate tidal volumes before extubation.</p><p>Patients with ventilatory compromise may require bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation (BIPAP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to support ventilation until they are back to baseline function after anesthesia. Respiratory mechanics may be best in the supine or slightly-head-up position.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1179771666\"><span class=\"h2\">Regional anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regional anesthesia is an alternative to general anesthesia for lower abdominal and extremity surgery. Peripheral nerve block may be appropriate for minor procedures on the upper or lower extremities, with the usual indications and contraindications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of peripheral nerve blocks&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Spinal anesthesia may be used, especially for the urologic procedures that are commonly performed for patients with chronic SCI. Spinal anesthesia can effectively prevent autonomic dysfunction. The level of spinal block may be difficult to determine in patients with high spinal cord lesions, though in practice, a standard dose of spinal drug usually results in an acceptable block. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-anesthesia-technique#H520191544\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal anesthesia: Technique&quot;, section on 'Choice of spinal drugs'</a>.)</p><p>Hypotension from spinal anesthesia-induced sympathectomy does not seem to occur in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], perhaps because of their baseline low sympathetic tone.</p><p>Epidural anesthesia is less appropriate than spinal anesthesia for patients with SCI. With epidural anesthesia, sacral anesthesia may be unreliable, and patchy block is possible, especially when there are spinal deformities. There are reports of failure of epidural anesthesia to prevent AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Also, sensory deficits may complicate interpretation of the epidural test dose; total spinal has been reported in this setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1197971011\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning for surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Positioning for patients with SCI requires meticulous attention to detail. These patients are at high risk for pressure injury of skin and bony prominences during even relatively brief procedures. Pressure points should be padded, as should all plastic connectors and other parts of IV tubing and monitoring devices. Positioning may be challenging for patients with contractures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3300551767\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodynamic management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following section discusses general hemodynamic management for patients with chronic SCI. Management of intraoperative autonomic dysreflexia is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H747703523\" class=\"local\">'Management of intraoperative autonomic dysreflexia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Goal blood pressure (BP)</strong> &ndash; We aim to maintain mean arterial pressure within 20 to 25 percent of baseline for patients with chronic SCI during anesthesia in order to maintain spinal cord and coronary perfusion. However, data to support specific BP goals for these patients are lacking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The majority of neurologic recovery after SCI occurs within the first three to six months postinjury, but a small proportion of patients will have late recovery of function out to five years, particularly with incomplete SCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with chronic SCI are at high risk for coronary artery disease, and may be asymptomatic. We maintain a high index of suspicion for cardiovascular disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fluid management</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Patients with high thoracic or cervical spinal cord lesions may be hypovolemic and anemic, and may be unable to compensate for even modest blood loss with an increase in sympathetic activity. Preloading with volume prior to induction and diligent replacement of blood loss are important for maintaining adequate cardiac output. Their loss of baroreceptor activity also makes them more susceptible to hypotension with positive pressure ventilation (PPV).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vasoactive medications</strong> &ndash; In addition to volume resuscitation, vasoactive medications are often required during anesthesia for patients with SCI. With injury above the cardioaccelerator sympathetic innervation (T1 to T4), vasopressors with inotropic and chronotropic properties in addition to vasoconstriction (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a>, norepinephrine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>) are often required to treat hypotension. With lower spinal injuries, peripheral sympathectomy and vasodilation often require treatment with a pure vasoconstrictor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a>).

Women with SCI below T11 will be able to perceive labor pain, while those with lesions at T5 to T10 may have painless delivery. Symptoms of AD may be the only signs of labor for patients with high SCI. In addition to malignant hypertension with the risk of intracranial hemorrhage and hypertensive encephalopathy, AD during labor may lead to uteroplacental vasoconstriction and fetal hypoxia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic disorders complicating pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Spinal cord injury'</a>.)</p><p>These patients should have an antepartum consultation with an anesthesiologist to develop a plan for labor analgesia. Epidural analgesia should be established early or before labor and may be challenging because of contractures, spasms, or prior spine surgery. Continuous spinal, combined spinal&ndash;epidural (CSE), and epidural techniques have all been used successfully for parturients at risk for, or who have developed, AD. Patients with SCI above T6 require either general or regional anesthesia for cesarean delivery to prevent AD. Regional anesthesia should be continued in the postpartum period until hemodynamics are stable, as postpartum uterine contractions may elicit an AD response. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuraxial-analgesia-for-labor-and-delivery-including-instrumented-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuraxial analgesia for labor and delivery (including instrumented delivery)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for cesarean delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Monitoring during labor and delivery for parturients with high SCI should include continual blood pressure (BP) and electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring.

(See <a href=\"#H1843153\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with SCI above approximately T6 are at risk for autonomic dysreflexia (AD), which consists of a potentially life-threatening, exaggerated sympathetic response to stimulus below the level of the spinal injury. Patients who are at risk for AD require anesthesia, even with complete loss of sensation at the surgical site, to prevent AD. (See <a href=\"#H1843177\" class=\"local\">'Autonomic dysreflexia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients without sensation at the surgical site, with SCI below T6, and with no history of AD may require no anesthesia or monitored anesthesia care. (See <a href=\"#H65968679\" class=\"local\">'Choice of anesthetic technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Either general anesthesia or regional anesthesia may be used for lower abdominal or lower extremity surgery for patients at risk for AD. (See <a href=\"#H65968679\" class=\"local\">'Choice of anesthetic technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with high SCI are often hypovolemic and are more sensitive to the sedative and cardiodepressant effects of anesthetic induction agents. We administer an intravenous (IV) fluid bolus prior to induction and reduce the dose of induction agent. (See <a href=\"#H3473309256\" class=\"local\">'Induction of anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Succinylcholine</a> can cause severe hyperkalemia after approximately three days after SCI. We avoid succinylcholine after 48 hours after injury. (See <a href=\"#H536088557\" class=\"local\">'Neuromuscular blocking agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood pressure (BP) should be managed carefully in patients with chronic SCI to maintain spinal cord and coronary perfusion. We aim for a mean arterial pressure within 20 to 25 percent of baseline. (See <a href=\"#H3300551767\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with SCI above T6 are at high risk for AD during labor and delivery. Epidural, combined spinal&ndash;epidural (CSE), or continuous spinal should be established early in labor for these patients. Patients with SCI above T6 need general anesthesia or neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery to prevent AD.
