It is estimated that there are 248 million HBV carriers in the world, of whom roughly 600,000 die annually from HBV-related liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The implementation of effective vaccination programs in many countries has resulted in a significant decrease in the incidence of new hepatitis B infection. Nevertheless, HBV infection remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality.</p><p>The spectrum of clinical manifestations of HBV infection varies in both acute and chronic disease. During the acute phase, manifestations range from subclinical or anicteric hepatitis to icteric hepatitis and, in some cases, fulminant hepatitis. During the chronic phase, manifestations range from an asymptomatic carrier state to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Extrahepatic manifestations also can occur with both acute and chronic infection.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the epidemiology, modes of transmission, and prevention of HBV infection. The clinical manifestations and natural history of HBV infection as well as hepatitis B vaccination are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY OF CHRONIC HBV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is estimated that approximately two billion people worldwide have evidence of past or present infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and 248 million individuals are chronic carriers (ie, positive for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The overall prevalence of HBsAg is reported to be 3.6 percent; however, it varies depending upon the geographic area. The prevalence of chronic HBV ranges from &lt;2 percent in low-prevalence areas (eg, United States, Canada, Western Europe) to 2 to 7 percent in intermediate-prevalence areas (eg, Mediterranean countries, Japan, Central Asia, Middle East, and parts of South America) to &ge;8 percent in high-prevalence areas (eg, Western Africa, South Sudan) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51820\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51820 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>The wide range in the prevalence of patients with chronic HBV in different parts of the world is largely related to differences in the age at infection, which is inversely related to the risk of chronicity. The rate of progression from acute to chronic HBV infection is approximately 90 percent for perinatally acquired infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], 20 to 50 percent for infections between the age of one and five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], and less than 5 percent for adult-acquired infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In areas of low prevalence, many of the patients who have chronic HBV were born in areas where the prevalence is higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/8-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-14</a>]. As an example, in an analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; which includes data from approximately 20,000 persons), the prevalence of chronic HBV in the United States from 2007 to 2012 was estimated to be 0.3 percent; however, the prevalence among foreign-born non-Hispanic blacks during the same period was 2.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, from 2011 to 2012, the prevalence among non-Hispanic Asians (most of whom were foreign born) was estimated to be 3.1 percent, accounting for approximately 50 percent of chronic HBV cases in the United States during that time period. In another study that evaluated 1615 adults with chronic HBV from across the United States and in Toronto, Canada, only 18 percent were born in North America; of those who were born outside North America, most were from Asia (67 percent) and Africa (11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In 2013, viral hepatitis, primarily due to HBV and hepatitis C virus, was the seventh leading cause of death worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Most mortality was attributable to liver cancer and cirrhosis. Globally, the total number of deaths due to hepatitis B in 2013 was estimated to be 686,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In the United States, the rate of HBV-related mortality from 2009 to 2013 was 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">deaths/100,000</span> population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]; among the various subpopulations, HBV-related mortality was highest among Asians and Pacific Islanders at 2.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">deaths/100,000</span> population. In China, the age-standardized death rate for HBV-related liver cancer and cirrhosis in 2013 was 10.95 and 4.91 per 100,000 people, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION OF HBV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted from patients who are infected to those who are not immune (ie, hepatitis B surface antibody [anti-HBs]-negative). Hepatitis B vaccination has significantly reduced the risk of transmission worldwide. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus vaccination&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-immunization-in-infants-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus immunization in infants, children, and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The predominant mode of HBV transmission varies in different geographical areas. Mother-to-child transmission is the predominant mode of transmission in high-prevalence areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In comparison, horizontal transmission, particularly in early childhood, accounts for most cases of chronic HBV infection in intermediate-prevalence areas, while unprotected sexual intercourse and injection drug use in adults are the major routes of spread in low-prevalence areas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51820\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51820 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In the United States, the incidence of acute HBV decreased by 81 percent from 1990 to 2006; the greatest decline was among children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. From 2006 to 2013, the incidence of HBV infection generally remained stable at 1 case per 100,000 persons, with an estimated 19,764 newly infected patients in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Rates were highest in adults, particularly males aged 25 to 44 years. However, during this period, the incidence of acute HBV infection increased in three states (Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia); the greatest increase occurred in non-urban counties, and most were associated with drug use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Prior reports had identified sexual exposure (eg, sexual contact with a person known to have HBV, multiple sex partners, men who have sex with men) as the most common risk factor for HBV transmission in adults in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>This section will review the different modes of transmission. A detailed discussion on prevention is found below. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mother-to-child transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The infection rate of infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers is as high as 90 percent among infants who do not receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-immune-globulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hepatitis B immune globulin</a> and hepatitis B vaccination at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Mother-to-child transmission may occur in utero, at the time of birth, or after birth. However, most infections occur at or before birth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy#H182095830\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B and pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Mother-to-child transmission'</a>.)</p><p>Passive and active immunization of the newborn within 12 hours of delivery has reduced the risk of HBV transmission by more than 95 percent. However, despite the proper use of prophylaxis, transmission can still occur. The risk appears to be greatest if the mother is positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> has a high HBV viral load. Among women with a high viral load, antiviral therapy for the mother can further reduce the risk of transmission. Detailed discussions on preventing mother-to-child transmission are found elsewhere.

A discussion of breastfeeding among HBV-infected women is found elsewhere.

In a study conducted in Taiwan, the HBV infection rate was 65 percent among neonates born to HBsAg-negative mothers and HBsAg-positive fathers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Most of these transmissions are believed to result from close contact of the unprotected infants with the infected blood and body fluids of the fathers. Although some studies have detected HBV in sperm, there is no clinical evidence to support that infected sperm result in transmission of HBV infection to the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The World Health Organization suggests screening with both HBsAg and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The risk of HBV transmission through blood transfusions was significantly reduced after the introduction of serologic screening of donors for HBsAg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The risk was further reduced by screening for anti-HBc in addition to HBsAg. Anti-HBc can be detected during the widow phase when HBsAg is not present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;, section on 'Acute hepatitis'</a>.)</p><p>In the United States, the residual risk of HBV transmission using this approach ranged from approximately 1 in 280,000 to 1 in 357,000 donations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This risk has been further reduced by the addition of HBV DNA screening. In 2009, the United States started screening blood donors for HBsAg, anti-HBc, and HBV DNA. HBV DNA is tested by mini-pool nucleic acid testing (MP-NAT); if NAT testing is positive in the mini-pool, the individual samples are further evaluated. The practice of testing for HBV nucleic acid as part of MP-NAT screening has lowered the risk of HBV transmission through transfusions to 1 in 1 million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Some countries, including Singapore, Spain, and Germany, are also using NAT for screening of HBV infection. However, the implementation of NAT in countries with high prevalence, where mini-pool testing would identify HBV in as many as 9.5 per million donations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], is hampered by the cost involved. An additional discussion on blood donor screening is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing&quot;, section on 'Infectious disease screening'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Sexual transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sexual transmission remains a common source of HBV transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/17,22,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,22,34</a>]. As an example, in one report that evaluated 2220 cases of acute HBV infection in the United States, sexual risk was believed to account for HBV transmission in approximately 35 percent of the cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Unvaccinated men who have sex with men and heterosexual persons who have multiple sex partners or contact with sex workers are at particularly high risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In the United States, sexual transmission had been considered the primary source of transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; however, from 2006 to 2011, most new cases of acute HBV were associated with drug use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Percutaneous inoculation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous transmission usually happens among injection drug users (IDU) who share syringes and needles. A systematic review, which evaluated data from 59 countries, estimated that there were 6.4 million injection drug users who were anti-HBc-positive, and 1.2 million who were HBsAg-positive in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In the United States, drug use has been reported to be the primary risk factor for HBV transmission in recent years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The risk of HBV transmission increases with number of years of drug use, frequency of injection, and sharing of drug preparation equipment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. In addition to drug use, certain practices such as acupuncture, tattooing, and body piercing have also been associated with transmission of HBV through the use of equipment that is contaminated with HBV-infected blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Nosocomial infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HBV can be transmitted in the healthcare setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Transmission generally occurs from patient to patient or from patient to healthcare providers (HCP) via contaminated instruments or an accidental needle stick. The number of HBV infections among HCP has declined significantly, due in large part to efforts aimed at immunizing all HCP against HBV and using postexposure prophylaxis for nonimmune persons (ie, those who are unvaccinated or vaccine nonresponders). Among individuals who are not immune to HBV, the risk of transmission depends upon the HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA status of the source. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-for-health-care-providers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations for health care providers&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infection among healthcare providers&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although uncommon, transmission can also occur from an infected HCP to a nonimmune patient. Transmission usually results from unsafe injection practices, which often could have been avoided with standard precautions and appropriate aseptic techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, several reports have demonstrated that transmission can occur even when such policies are followed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. As an example, in a case series from 1996 to 2002, there were reports of 12 infected HCP infecting a total of 91 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The risk of HBV transmission from infected HCP depends upon the HBeAg status and the HBV DNA level of the infected provider. Transmission has generally been considered to be greatest among patients with chronic HBV who are HBeAg-positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>] and can occur in patients with a wide range of HBV DNA levels.

In addition, spouses and steady sex partners of a patient with chronic HBV should be screened to see if they have been previously infected. Those who are not immune and are without evidence of chronic HBV should be vaccinated and immunity verified by testing for anti-HBs one to two months after completing the course of vaccination.

Exposure-prone procedures include major abdominal, cardiothoracic, and orthopedic surgery, repair of major traumatic injuries, abdominal and vaginal hysterectomy, caesarean section, vaginal deliveries, and major oral or maxillofacial surgery. However, if a percutaneous exposure should occur, the uninfected patient should still receive postexposure prophylaxis.

In some transplant centers, donors are also screened for HBV DNA. However, it is unclear if testing donors for HBV DNA reduces the risk of HBV transmission to recipients. As an example, in a report from France that included 11,115 consecutive organ, tissue, and cell donors, HBV DNA was only detected in 0.07 percent of individuals without serologic markers for chronic HBV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Thus, serologic testing is still the mainstay of screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>The use of HBsAg-positive or HBV DNA-positive donors should be avoided for HBV-na&iuml;ve recipients if a suitable donor without HBV is available. However, in situations where this is not possible, treatment of the donor <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recipients with antiviral therapy and HBIG may help decrease the risk of transmission.
