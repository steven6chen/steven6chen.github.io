DVT can be very dangerous because clots within a deep vein can break off and travel to the lungs, causing something called a &quot;pulmonary embolism.&quot;</p><p>Again, superficial vein <span class=\"nowrap\">phlebitis/thrombosis</span> affects veins near the <strong>surface</strong> of the skin. DVT affects veins <strong>deep</strong> in the muscle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633261197\"><span class=\"h1\">Is superficial vein phlebitis/thrombosis dangerous?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Superficial vein phlebitis is not usually dangerous. But with superficial vein thrombosis, clots in a superficial vein can extend into a deep vein causing DVT, or break off, causing pulmonary embolism. For these reasons, superficial vein thrombosis is taken very seriously, especially when it affects the thigh or upper arm, where superficial and deep veins meet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633261224\"><span class=\"h1\">How does superficial vein phlebitis/thrombosis relate to other vein problems?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who get superficial vein <span class=\"nowrap\">phlebitis/thrombosis</span> often also have a type of vein disease called &quot;venous insufficiency.&quot;</p><p>Venous insufficiency can occur with or without varicose veins (twisted, swollen veins), and most often affects the legs. When the veins are healthy and working normally, they carry blood in only 1 direction, from the arms and legs back to the heart. Veins have valves inside them to keep blood moving toward the heart. The valves open to let blood flow to the heart, and close to keep blood from flowing backwards. When the valves are damaged or do not work well, blood flows backward and collects in the veins. This is called venous insufficiency.</p><p>People without venous insufficiency can also get superficial vein <span class=\"nowrap\">phlebitis/thrombosis</span>. This usually happens after having an intravenous catheter, which is a tube that goes into a vein to give medicines. But even people who had nothing put into a vein can get superficial vein <span class=\"nowrap\">phlebitis/thrombosis</span>. For instance, it can happen to people with blood clotting problems or cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633261264\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of superficial vein phlebitis/thrombosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain, tenderness, or redness along the length of a vein</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hardening of the vein</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid draining from the area where a catheter was put in</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling of the affected arm or leg</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633261279\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, if you have symptoms of superficial vein <span class=\"nowrap\">phlebitis/thrombosis,</span> see your doctor or nurse. See him or her <strong>right away</strong> if the affected arm or leg is swollen, or if the affected vein is in the thigh or upper arm.</p><p><strong>Call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong> if you get symptoms of a blood clot in the lungs, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Panting or trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sharp, knife-like chest pain when you breathe in</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coughing or coughing up blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A rapid heartbeat</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633261294\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor or nurse might be able to tell what is happening by doing an exam and learning about your symptoms. He or she might also do a test called an ultrasound. An ultrasound will show if any of the veins are blocked, especially the deep veins. It can also check how well the valves in the veins work. In some cases, your doctor might order blood tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633261309\"><span class=\"h1\">How is superficial vein phlebitis/thrombosis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment for superficial vein <span class=\"nowrap\">phlebitis/thrombosis</span> focuses on easing the symptoms. To do this, doctors recommend that you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use heating or cooling pads on the affected area</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raise the arm or leg, propping it up on pillows or a chair when resting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a medicine called an NSAID &ndash; Examples include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand names: Aleve, Naprosyn)</p><p/><p>If your superficial vein <span class=\"nowrap\">phlebitis/thrombosis</span> is near where you have (or had) an intravenous catheter, your doctor will check for infection. If you do have an infection, you might need antibiotics.</p><p>If superficial vein <span class=\"nowrap\">phlebitis/thrombosis</span> is in your leg, your doctor or nurse might also suggest you wear compression stockings. These are special socks that fit tightly over the ankle and leg. If your doctor or nurse recommends them, he or she will tell you which type to wear and how to put them on.</p><p>Some people do not need treatment beyond that described above. In some cases where superficial vein thrombosis is near the deep veins, though, your doctors will prescribe a medicine to prevent more clots from forming.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633261324\"><span class=\"h1\">Can superficial vein phlebitis/thrombosis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chances of getting superficial vein <span class=\"nowrap\">phlebitis/thrombosis</span> in the leg veins by staying active and not sitting too long without moving.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633261339\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicose-veins-and-other-vein-disease-in-the-legs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Varicose veins and other vein disease in the legs (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-blood-clots-in-the-legs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the legs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=doppler-ultrasound-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Doppler ultrasound (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=swelling-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Swelling (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anti-clotting-medicines-warfarin-coumadin-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anti-clotting medicines: Warfarin (Coumadin) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anti-clotting-medicines-direct-oral-anticoagulants-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anti-clotting medicines: Direct oral anticoagulants (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-venous-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic venous disease (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
