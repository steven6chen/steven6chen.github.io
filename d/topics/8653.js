Cutaneous manifestations similar to those of IgAV (HSP) are also seen in several other disorders, including mixed (immunoglobulin G <span class=\"nowrap\">[IgG]/immunoglobulin</span> M [IgM]) cryoglobulinemia, antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated small vessel vasculitis, and hypersensitivity vasculitis (which includes what had been called serum sickness) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Skin vasculitis with palpable petechiae or purpura is typically a major finding in these disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63367\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63367 \">picture 1</a>). A general overview of the different vasculitic disorders is discussed elsewhere.

The histologic findings in the kidney are identical to those in IgA nephropathy, suggesting that the two disorders may have a similar pathogenesis. Likewise, the finding of high circulating levels of galactose-deficient IgA1 in patients with both IgA nephropathy and IgAV (HSP) suggest a common underlying pathogenetic mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The observation of the simultaneous occurrence of IgAV (HSP) and IgA nephropathy in twins after an adenovirus infection is further evidence in support of a common pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The course of the renal disease and circulating antibody titers are roughly parallel, and these autoantibodies do not appear to be present in patients with IgAV (HSP) who do not have renal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>IgAV (HSP) occurs more often in children than in adults, but renal involvement is more likely to occur and be more severe in older children and in adults, prompting more aggressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]. The renal manifestations of IgAV (HSP), including prognosis and treatment, will be reviewed here.

Renal involvement is typically noted within a few days to one month after the onset of systemic symptoms but is not predictably related to the severity of extrarenal involvement. In a prospective study of 223 children under 16 years of age, the presence of abdominal pain but not melena or joint symptoms conferred a significant increase in the risk for nephritis (odds ratio 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-3.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In addition, most of the patients who had a creatinine clearance below 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> within four months of presentation were over age 60 years.

Confirmation of the diagnosis of IgAV (HSP) requires evidence of tissue deposition in the skin or kidney of IgA by immunofluorescence microscopy. Biopsy of the skin lesions reveals inflammation of the small blood vessels, called a leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which is most prominent in the postcapillary venules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F52548%7ERHEUM%2F66296\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52548 graphicRef66296 \">image 1A-B</a>).</p><p>A kidney biopsy can be done to establish the diagnosis, but this invasive procedure is generally reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is uncertain or who have more severe renal involvement (eg, proteinuria greater than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> renal function impairment). Light microscopy can show a wide spectrum of glomerular changes, ranging from isolated mesangial proliferation, focal and segmental proliferation, to severe crescentic glomerulonephritis. The diagnostic finding is dominant or codominant IgA deposition, mostly IgA1, in the mesangium on immunofluorescence, similar to that seen in IgA nephropathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F69895\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69895 \">picture 2</a>). In addition, immunofluorescence may reveal immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin (IgM), fibrinogen, and C3 in the glomeruli. Immunofluorescence staining for C1q is rarely found in IgAV (HSP) nephritis and should suggest the possibility of lupus nephritis. By electron microscopy, electron-dense deposits are typically found in the mesangial areas, occasionally extending out into the peripheral capillary loops (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58102\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58102 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The short-term outcome of renal disease in IgAV (HSP) is favorable in most patients, with complete recovery reported in 94 and 89 percent of children and adults, respectively, at a mean of approximately 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The following discussion on renal prognosis will be limited to IgAV (HSP) in children. The long-term renal prognosis of IgAV (HSP) nephritis has, in most studies, been worse in adults than in children, a finding that may be due in part to concurrent chronic kidney disease or a longer duration between disease onset and clinical presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H44949855\" class=\"local\">'Adults'</a> above.)</p><p>Among children, the manifestations of active IgAV (HSP) usually resolve spontaneously. The renal prognosis is excellent when transient hematuria and proteinuria resolves within several months, a course that is generally associated with only focal glomerular involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/15,17,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17,21</a>]. Recurrence (relapse) of IgAV (HSP) is common, occurring in up to one-third of patients, and may be more likely among children with renal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/13,21,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,21,35</a>]. Recurrent symptoms and signs, which tend to mimic the original episode (but tend to be less severe) are normally observed within four months of resolution of the initial symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Recurrent disease may not predict worse long-term outcomes.</p><p>The long-term prognosis of children with IgAV (HSP) nephritis was evaluated in the systematic review of 12 studies of 1133 children with IgAV (HSP) described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Long-term renal impairment was defined as nephrotic-range proteinuria (with or without edema or hypoalbuminemia), a serum creatinine above the upper level of normal, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypertension. The incidence of long-term renal impairment varied with the clinical findings and with sex:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Zero percent in patients who presented with a normal urinalysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1.6 percent in patients with isolated hematuria with or without non-nephrotic proteinuria (79 percent of patients with renal disease).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>19.5 percent in patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria, an elevated serum creatinine, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypertension (21 percent of patients with renal disease). These three predictors are also predictors of a worse prognosis in virtually all causes of glomerular disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of long-term renal impairment was 2.5 times higher in females than males.</p><p/><p>The authors of the systematic review reached the following conclusions about monitoring. Children with an initially normal urinalysis should have follow-up urine testing for the first six months since 97 percent of children with IgAV (HSP) who develop renal disease do so within this time period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Children with isolated hematuria with or without non-nephrotic-range proteinuria that persists after six months should have periodic monitoring of the serum creatinine as long as the hematuria and proteinuria persist. Children at increased risk should be evaluated by a nephrologist.</p><p>In addition to these clinical predictors of prognosis, there are also pathologic predictors on renal biopsy. In general, the extent of renal injury parallels the clinical severity of renal disease. The percentage of glomeruli showing crescents seems to be the most important prognostic finding. The following observations were noted in a study of 151 children referred to a major academic center and then followed for 1 to 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with crescents involving more than 50 percent of glomeruli, 37 percent progressed to end-stage renal disease, and another 18 percent had chronic kidney disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients who developed end-stage renal disease, 86 percent had crescents affecting more than 50 percent of glomeruli.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Few or no crescents were seen on initial biopsy in the 70 percent of patients who recovered or had only minimal urinary abnormalities at latest examination.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent and progressive disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A minority of affected patients have persistent renal manifestations.

However, in a well-designed pilot trial of patients with IgA nephropathy, treatment with rituximab was not more effective than conservative therapy at reducing proteinuria or improving renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. More studies are required to evaluate the efficacy of rituximab in patients with IgAV (HSP) nephritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal transplantation can be performed in patients with IgAV (HSP) nephritis who progress to end-stage renal disease, although recurrent disease can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/64-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-68</a>]. Deposition of IgA in the graft is common, but many cases are subclinical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. An early study suggested that clinically evident recurrence occurs in approximately 35 percent of patients at five years with a rate of graft loss due to recurrent disease of 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Other reviews suggest a lower rate of recurrence (2.5 and 11.5 percent at 5 and 10 years in one small series) but still show a relatively high risk of graft loss due to recurrent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/67,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,70</a>]. As an example, a retrospective review demonstrated 13.5 percent graft loss due to recurrent IgAV (HSP) in 330 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. The overall graft survival, however, appears to be the same for patients with IgAV (HSP) compared with other renal allograft recipients.</p><p>The diagnosis of recurrent renal disease is based not only upon the demonstration of mesangial IgA deposits but also clinical features of the disease, since isolated deposits can be seen without any clinical features of IgAV (HSP). It is possible that asymptomatic IgA deposits may have been present in the donor kidney prior to transplantation. Several reports have documented this phenomenon, but the IgA deposits disappeared within weeks after transplantation due, presumably, to the lack of circulating IgA-containing immune complexes in the recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>]. Thus, persistent deposits presumably reflect recurrent disease.</p><p>Recurrent glomerular disease, often in association with active extrarenal involvement, can lead to loss of the graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/64,65,67,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65,67,73</a>]. Although one study suggested that this was more likely in patients with aggressive initial disease and relatively rapid progression to end-stage renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], the association between recurrence and severity of the original disease was not confirmed in a later report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. It is recommended by some that transplantation be delayed for 12 to 24 months after the disappearance of purpura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>]. However, this approach does not prevent recurrent disease in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>Some observations suggest that the risk of recurrent disease may be higher in recipients of living, related-donor transplants, a finding similar to that seen in IgA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. However, this observation was not confirmed in the retrospective series of 339 patients that is cited above, in which the rate of recurrence was the same for those who received kidneys from deceased donors versus living, related donors (13 versus 14.3, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H279390798\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The pathogenesis of this disorder may be similar to that of IgA nephropathy, which is associated with identical histologic findings in the kidney. (See <a href=\"#H1521746428\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twenty to 54 percent of children with IgAV (HSP) have renal involvement at initial presentation. Renal disease is more common and is often more severe in adults who may present with nephrotic syndrome, acute kidney injury, and hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Renal manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of IgAV (HSP) in children includes microscopic polyangiitis; clotting disorders, such as the antiphospholipid syndrome; and sepsis. The differential diagnosis of IgAV (HSP) in adults includes other systemic autoimmune diseases, such as hypersensitivity vasculitis, cryoglobulinemia, and systemic lupus erythematosus. If pulmonary or upper airway disease is present, microscopic polyangiitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's), and anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibody disease should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is confirmed by skin or kidney biopsy. A kidney biopsy is reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is uncertain or who have more severe renal involvement. A kidney biopsy should be done in patients who excrete more than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> of protein <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have impaired renal function during the acute episode. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the short-term outcome of renal disease in IgAV (HSP) is favorable in most patients without specific treatment, recurrence of IgAV (HSP) is common. A minority of patients with IgAV (HSP) have persistent renal manifestations, and late deterioration can occur even among patients with initial complete resolution of renal manifestations. Among adults, the reported rates of end-stage renal disease range from 10 to 30 percent at 15 years. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with IgAV (HSP), we do <strong>not</strong> treat with glucocorticoids to prevent the development of IgAV (HSP) nephritis. (See <a href=\"#H3642668259\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific treatment of IgAV (HSP) nephritis should be considered only in patients with marked proteinuria (&gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impaired renal function during the acute episode. We typically obtain a renal biopsy in this setting since the severity of the histologic lesions (particularly the degree of crescent formation) appears to be the best indicator of prognosis. Patients with limited evidence of renal involvement, such as microscopic hematuria, macroscopic hematuria of short duration, or mild proteinuria (&lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day),</span> are generally not subjected to renal biopsy and are not given specific therapy but should be followed closely for worsening of proteinuria or impairment of renal function. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children with IgAV (HSP) nephritis, our initial treatment approach depends upon the severity of renal disease.

We monitor urine protein excretion and serum creatinine once per week for one month, then every two weeks for two months to assess for disease progression. In patients who develop an increase in proteinuria to &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> or an increase in serum creatinine, we perform a renal biopsy to evaluate the need for more aggressive therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In children who present with more severe renal involvement (ie, proteinuria of &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day,</span> nephrotic syndrome, or evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis on renal biopsy), we administer three pulses of intravenous (IV) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> (one dose daily, or on alternate days, for three doses), followed by oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> once daily for one month, then oral prednisone 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> every other day for two months. We monitor urine protein excretion and serum creatinine once per week for one month, then every two weeks for two months.

If the renal biopsy reveals chronic lesions without active inflammation, we treat with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) indefinitely to reduce proteinuria, unless contraindicated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our approach to initial therapy in adult patients with IgAV (HSP) nephritis is based upon the severity of renal disease at the time of presentation and the likelihood of progression to renal failure. (See <a href=\"#H2484033984\" class=\"local\">'Approach in adults'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In adults who present with limited evidence of renal involvement (ie, microscopic hematuria, macroscopic hematuria of short duration, or proteinuria of &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> and a normal serum creatinine), we do not treat with specific therapy for IgAV (HSP) nephritis. We treat all patients with &gt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> of proteinuria with ACE inhibitors or ARBs to reduce proteinuria, unless contraindicated. We monitor urine protein excretion and serum creatinine once per week for one month, then every two weeks for two months to assess for disease progression. In patients who develop an increase in proteinuria to &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> or an increase in serum creatinine, we perform a renal biopsy to evaluate the need for more aggressive therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In adults who present with more severe renal involvement (ie, proteinuria of &gt;750 mg to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day,</span> nephrotic syndrome, evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis on renal biopsy), we typically administer a six-month, tapering course of glucocorticoids. We give pulse IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> at a dose of 500 mg to 1 g daily for three days, followed by oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 60 mg daily or 120 mg every other day. We monitor urine protein excretion and serum creatinine every two weeks for one month and then monthly for the first six months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>In patients who respond to treatment with a reduction in proteinuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decrease in serum creatinine, we gradually taper the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose. This approach is similar to that used in the treatment of some patients with IgA nephropathy who receive glucocorticoid therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>In patients who have persistent proteinuria of &gt;750 mg to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> after four to six months of treatment, we obtain a renal biopsy to determine if there is ongoing inflammatory injury. If the renal biopsy demonstrates evidence of persistent, active inflammation (ie, proliferative glomerulonephritis), some clinicians would choose to treat with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>. The evidence for either therapy is based on very limited data. Given the potential toxicities of each therapy, we prefer a six-month trial of mycophenolate at 500 to 1000 mg twice daily. If the renal biopsy reveals chronic lesions without active inflammation, we treat with an ACE inhibitor or ARB indefinitely to reduce proteinuria, unless contraindicated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In patients who have a larger number of active crescents on renal biopsy (over 20 to 25 percent), some clinicians would treat with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil (MMF) in addition to the six-month course of glucocorticoids. We prefer to give IV cyclophosphamide 500 mg every two weeks for a total of six doses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal transplantation can be performed in those patients who progress to end-stage renal disease.
