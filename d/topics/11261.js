VHL is diagnosed in approximately 1 in 36,000 people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. </p><p>The initial manifestations of disease can occur in childhood or adolescence, or later (mean age approximately 26 years). The spectrum of VHL-associated tumors includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retinal hemangioblastomas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clear cell renal cell carcinomas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pheochromocytomas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endolymphatic sac tumors of the middle ear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serous cystadenomas and neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Papillary cystadenomas of the epididymis and broad ligament</p><p/><p>The molecular biology and pathogenesis of VHL disease, and the relationship of specific gene mutations to the clinical manifestations of the disease are reviewed here. The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of VHL disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of von Hippel-Lindau disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The von Hippel-Lindau (<em>VHL</em>) gene has been mapped to chromosome 3p25 and cloned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Its gene product, VHL, functions as a tumor suppressor protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As with mutations in certain other tumor suppressor genes (eg, the retinoblastoma 1 [<em>RB1</em>] gene), a &quot;two-hit&quot; model has been validated for VHL disease in which a germline mutation inactivates one copy of the <em>VHL</em> gene in all cells. For VHL-associated tumors to develop, there must be loss of expression of the second normal allele through either somatic mutation or deletion of the second allele, or through hypermethylation of its promoter. In sporadic renal cell cancers, inactivation of <em>VHL</em> through somatic mutation of both alleles is very common.</p><p>Major advances have been made over the last two decades in understanding the biology that underlies the formation of VHL-associated tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. The VHL protein forms a stable complex with several other proteins, including elongin B, elongin C, and cullin 2. This complex targets several proteins for proteasomal degradation, thereby regulating their levels within the cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The VHL component of this complex functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for the target molecules. Once bound to the VHL complex, the target molecules are covalently bound to ubiquitin, facilitating degradation by the proteasome.</p><p>In addition to its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, VHL performs several other important cellular functions, including maintenance of the primary cilium, regulation of cytokinesis, control of microtubule function, extracellular matrix integrity, and regulation of the cell cycle. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and 2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha and 2 alpha (HIF1A and HIF2A) are two of the major proteins regulated by VHL. HIF1A is involved in erythropoiesis through its ability to induce transcription of messenger RNA coding for erythropoietin. The role of HIF1 in erythropoiesis is discussed in detail elsewhere, but it will be briefly reviewed here to permit understanding of the events that occur in VHL disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-erythropoiesis#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of erythropoiesis&quot;, section on 'Hypoxia-inducible factor and the response to hypoxia'</a>.)</p><p>Transcriptional activation by HIF requires the heterodimerization and nuclear translocation of alpha and beta subunits. The beta subunit is not influenced by the oxygen tension and is not bound by the VHL protein complex. In contrast, the alpha subunits are sensitive to oxygen levels and are a substrate for the VHL protein complex. In the presence of normal oxygen tension, HIF1A and HIF2A are enzymatically hydroxylated. The hydroxylated HIF subunits are bound by the VHL protein complex and covalently linked to ubiquitin. Once this occurs, HIFA subunits are rapidly degraded by proteasomes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53801\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53801 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Under conditions of hypoxia, however, hydroxylation does not occur, and HIF1A and HIF2A are not bound to the VHL protein complex and cannot undergo ubiquitination. The levels of HIF1A and HIF2A rise, resulting in increased messenger RNA transcription of a variety of proteins, thus inducing a physiologic angiogenic response.</p><p>In patients with VHL disease, loss of the sole functioning <em>VHL</em> allele in somatic tissues causes a situation analogous to hypoxia, despite the presence of normal oxygen tension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/5,6,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,9,10</a>]. Mutations in the <em>VHL</em> gene can result either in VHL failing to form the necessary protein complex to bind HIF1A and HIF2A or in failure of the binding site on the complex to recognize HIFA proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In either case, HIF1A and HIF2A are not linked to ubiquitin and are not degraded in proteasomes. Elevated levels of HIF1A and HIF2A can then induce abnormal production of the same factors that would be produced in conditions of physiologic hypoxia.</p><p>Contemporary research indicates that HIF1A and HIF2A may possess distinct functional characteristics. Skewing of the ratio of HIF1A and HIF2A towards HIF2A may alter cell signaling and upregulate Myc activity in cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The ratio switching is likely due to several factors. Hypoxia-associated factor (HAF) was shown to increase HIF2A transactivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and HIF1A instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], resulting in a more aggressive cellular phenotype. In addition, in renal cell carcinoma tissue, preferential loss of chromosome 14q, the locus for the <em>HIF1A</em> gene, results in decreased levels of HIF1A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In addition to erythropoietin, other factors known to be regulated through HIF1A and HIF2A include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-beta, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/5,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,9</a>]. In addition, VHL affects several other factors potentially involved in tumorigenesis that are not regulated through the HIF1A system. These targets include matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as MMP1, MMP inhibitors, and atypical protein kinase C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>].</p><p>Although the mechanism of tumorigenesis remains unproven, the combined effect of various angiogenic factors and other growth factors may be to create an autocrine loop that provides an uncontrolled growth stimulus consistent with the highly vascular central nervous system tumors found in VHL patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Additionally, VHL regulates several key cellular processes of which disruption may result in a malignant phenotype. These processes include extracellular matrix control, microtubule regulation, cilia centrosome cycle control, and cell cycle control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13348203\"><span class=\"h2\">Extracellular matrix control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Presence of functional VHL is required to maintain proper assembly of an extracellular fibronectin matrix.

Mutations that preserve HIF regulation but are collagen IV binding incompetent, for example the L188V mutation, demonstrate malignant behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13348237\"><span class=\"h2\">Cilia centrosome regulation and microtubule control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary cilium is a nonmotile organelle involved in mechanosensing, cell signaling, and regulation of cellular entry into mitosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Loss of ciliary proteins or of signaling via canonical or noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways disrupts regulation of planar cell polarity and results in cyst formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Coordinate inactivation of VHL and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B) is sufficient to induce loss of primary cilium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and, in animal models of <em>Vhlh</em> and <em>Pten</em> loss, increases cyst formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. VHL was found to bind to and stabilize microtubules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The binding of VHL to microtubules is regulated by glycogen synthase 3, which phosphorylates VHL at serine 68 and requires a priming phosphorylation event on serine 72 by casein kinase 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Loss of VHL or expression of mutated VHL in cells results in unstable astral microtubules, dysregulation of the spindle assembly checkpoint, and an increase in aneuploidy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13348333\"><span class=\"h2\">Cell cycle control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adding back VHL to the <em>VHL</em> deficient 786-0 cell line results in acquisition of cell cycle arrest upon serum withdrawal, with concomitant upregulation of p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (also referred to as p27) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Deletions in <em>VHL</em>, and nonsense and frameshift variants appear to be more common in type I disease, while missense variants may be more common in type II disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

In particular, missense mutations at codon 167 were associated with a particularly high risk of pheochromocytoma (over 80 percent by age 50). The cumulative probability of renal cell carcinoma and the age-related risk for hemangioblastoma were similar in the two mutation groups. It is important to note that although the risk for pheochromocytomas is diminished with deletions or truncating mutations, the residual risk is high enough to warrant continued screening for pheochromocytomas in this patient population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By contrast, in a report of 274 individuals in 126 unrelated families, gene abnormalities resulting in a truncated protein or large rearrangements led to an increased incidence of renal cell carcinoma compared with missense mutations (81 versus 63 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, missense mutations within two narrow cluster regions of the <em>VHL</em> gene were associated with higher incidence of renal cell carcinoma than missense mutations elsewhere in the <em>VHL</em> gene.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Correlations between the <em>VHL</em> gene abnormality and the frequency of retinal capillary hemangioblastomas (RCHs) have also been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In a series of 196 patients, RCHs were twice as common among patients who had a substitution mutation than among those who had a gene abnormality resulting in a truncated protein.</p><p/><p>The most common identification of pathogenic variants in the <em>VHL </em>gene is the result of directed genetic testing or small hereditary cancer gene panels in patients with VHL-associated tumor presentations. However, in 2013 the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published recommendations for the reporting of incidental findings (now referred to as secondary findings) when performing clinical whole exome or genome sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The <em>VHL </em>gene was included on the list of 56 genes that were thought to be medically actionable. Thus, with the expansion of genomic sequencing, particularly in the diagnosis of young children with neurodevelopmental disorders, there may be an increase in the number of patients with VHL syndrome identified as a secondary finding. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an inherited, autosomal dominant syndrome manifested by a variety of benign and malignant neoplasms, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma, hemangioblastomas, pheochromocytomas, and other rare tumors.
