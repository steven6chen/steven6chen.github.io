This topic covers determination of caloric requirements and selection of enteral formulas. The target goal of avoiding the extremes of starvation and overfeeding is defined by estimating energy requirements and is subject to continued monitoring and revision based upon the metabolic characteristics of patients and their tolerance of enteral nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Information on patient selection and timing of nutritional support and evaluating nutritional support is discussed elsewhere.

Assessment of nutritional support falls into two distinct categories: the initial requirements and the ongoing requirements. The assessment of caloric demands within the first 24 hours generates an initial goal so that nutritional support can be initiated. However, the most critical component is to make adjustments for the ongoing needs during what is often a prolonged recovery associated with a prolonged course of hypermetabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The hypermetabolic response is likely more prolonged than previously thought, possibly extending for up to three years postinjury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The overestimation may be related to the changes in burn care since the formula was developed.

This enhanced process of lipolysis allows for excess exogenous fat to heighten recycling of free fatty acids and may result in increased fat storage.</p><p>Nutritional support with more than 15 percent of calories from lipids has been demonstrated to impair immunologic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/40,42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,42-45</a>]. In a randomized clinical trial, 43 moderate-to-severe burn patients were assigned to one of the following groups: high-fat solution (35 percent of total calories as fat), low-fat solution (15 percent fat), or low-fat solution with fish oil (15 percent fat), which was administered for 30 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Compared with the high-fat control group, groups on low-fat support had significantly fewer cases of pneumonia (3 out of 24 versus 7 out of 13) and a significantly shorter time to healing (1.2 versus 1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">days/percent</span> total body surface area burned). There was no difference in nitrogen balance between the high-fat and low-fat groups, and 3-methylhistidine excretion was higher and serum free cortisol lower in the low-fat groups.

There was a significant decrease in the median number of pulmonary infections in the trace element group compared with the control group (two versus four per patient), and wound healing was also significantly improved, with fewer requiring regrafting. Other studies have shown that supplementation with trace elements is associated with a shortened hospital stay and improved wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].</p><p>Due to the limited data supporting supernormal repletion of any micronutrients, routine practice at our center is to supplement all adult burn patients simply with an adult multivitamin, and all pediatric burn patients with a pediatric multivitamin.

Resuscitation with a hypertonic lactated saline solution (eg, lactated Ringer's solution) reduces the risk of electrolyte imbalances and tissue edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Electrolyte balance, however, must be monitored and corrected throughout all phases of burn care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia occur during the initial resuscitation period. Hypernatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia commonly occur during the early postresuscitation period and the hypermetabolic phase. We use a pharmacist-driven electrolyte protocol at our institution to reduce the risk of electrolyte imbalances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">FORMULA SELECTION FOR ENTERAL NUTRITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preferred method of nutritional support is by the enteral route (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nutritional support for moderate-to-severe burn patients&quot;, section on 'Delivery of nutritional support'</a>). Many commercial preparations exist for this purpose. These formulas come in a variety of compositions, and the &quot;standard&quot; adult nutritional formulas can provide appropriate support for wound healing and maintenance of lean body mass when they are used to provide adequate calorie and protein intake. Involvement of a dietician in the initial nutrition support of the burn patient, as well as when changes in physiologic and clinical status occur, is desirable. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunonutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of immune-modulating supplements or formulas holds particular appeal for patients with the profound hypermetabolic response and immune suppression that are associated with severe burns. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of commercially available immune-enhancing formulas, and the only agent with any supporting evidence to date is glutamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/1,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,61</a>].</p><p>ESPEN (European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism) has made no recommendation regarding supplementation with alpha-3 fatty acids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arginine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arginine</a>, or nucleotides for burned patients due to insufficient data but recommends that glutamine be added to standard formulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and the American Society for Parental and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) guidelines include consideration of the addition of enteral glutamine to an enteral feeding regimen in burn patients while managed in the intensive care unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/2,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,62</a>].</p><p>Glutamine supplementation is beneficial in the nutritional support of burn patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/1,2,63-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,63-70</a>]. A meta-analysis of four randomized trials that included 155 patients with moderate-to-severe burns found that patients receiving glutamine supplementation were significantly less likely to develop a gram-negative bacteremia compared with patients not receiving the supplementation (odds ratio [OR] 0.27, 95% CI 0.08-0.92, p = 0.04) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. In addition, patients receiving glutamine supplementation also had significantly lower in-hospital mortality rates (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03-0.51, p = 0.004). </p><p>Other trials have shown that enteral glutamine supplementation decreases infectious complications, shortens length of hospital stay, and reduces mortality rates following burn injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/1,2,63-69,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,63-69,71</a>]. For example, a clinical trial randomly assigned 40 patients sustaining 50 to 80 percent total body surface area (TBSA) burns to a glutamine-enriched enteral nutrition (0.35 grams <span class=\"nowrap\">Gln/kg</span> body <span class=\"nowrap\">weight/day)</span> or the standard enteral formulation, within 24 hours of burn injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. In the group receiving glutamine-enriched enteral nutrition, plasma glutamine levels were normalized compared to the persistently low levels in the standard formulation diet group. Compared to the standard formula group, the glutamine-enriched group had a significantly shorter length of hospital stay (67 versus 73 days) and greater percent wound healing at day 30 postburn (86 versus 72 percent). Endotoxin levels, which were initially elevated in both groups, decreased significantly in the glutamine-enriched group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Branched-chain amino acids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) have anabolic or, at a minimum, anticatabolic properties. Leucine, in particular, has received much attention because plasma leucine levels are typically depleted following a severe burn injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. However, clinical studies have failed to show any benefit to the administration of supplemental leucine as a component of nutritional support for burn patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. At this time, supplementation of BCAAs in burn patients is not recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Specialty formulas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several specialty formulas are commonly used in critical illness in an attempt to reduce renal failure, glucose intolerance, and pulmonary failure. Commercially available formulas for renal failure patients are lower in protein and restrict electrolytes, particularly potassium and phosphate. Many of these formulas use additional carbohydrate calories to compensate for the protein calories that are restricted in renal patients, and some contain additional fat as the source of calories.</p><p>Formulas that are higher in carbohydrates and lower in fat may be used appropriately in burn patients with renal failure and electrolyte abnormalities, recognizing the likely need to supplement protein in the moderate-to-severe burn patient population. Formulas available for patients with diabetes or those with stress glucose intolerance are lower in carbohydrates and higher in fat; therefore, this makes them an ineffective choice in burns, since higher-carbohydrate, low-fat diets have been clearly associated with better immune function and lesser loss of lean body mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/35,42,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,42,44</a>]. The use of pulmonary care formulas, designed for use in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to minimize excessive carbon dioxide production via increased fat and decreased carbohydrates, is not recommended for the same reasons. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT ADJUSTMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The energy and nutrient needs of burn patients are heterogeneous through the course of recovery. Nutritional needs fluctuate based upon wound closure and physical activity and may be impacted by complications such as pneumonia, renal insufficiency, or wound sepsis. The prolonged nature of the hypermetabolic response, which may persist for more than one year following injury, must be considered even after wound healing is complete.
