The decrease in cortisol production releases the feedback inhibition of cortisol on the pituitary and increases the production of corticotropin (ACTH). High ACTH causes adrenal hyperplasia and drives excessive accumulation of cortisol precursors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> overproduction of ACTH-dependent adrenal steroids along other pathways. The clinical manifestations of the different disorders are due to diminished production of cortisol and, depending upon the site of block, decreased or increased production of mineralocorticoids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> androgens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenal-steroid-biosynthesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adrenal steroid biosynthesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment aims to replace steroid deficiencies and reduce the production or block the action of steroid excess. The most common cause of CAH worldwide, accounting for &gt;90 percent of cases, is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The prevalence of other forms of CAH varies geographically, largely due to founder mutations that are often isolated in specific regions. All forms of CAH are inherited as autosomal recessive traits. This topic review will discuss the clinical and biochemical characteristics of the other forms of CAH, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CYP17A1 deficiencies (combined <span class=\"nowrap\">17-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase</span> deficiency [17OHD] and isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency [ILD])</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 deficiency</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CYP11B1 deficiency (11-hydroxylase deficiency [11OHD])</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytochrome P450-oxidoreductase (POR) deficiency (ORD)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hexose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency (apparent cortisone reductase deficiency [ACRD])</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate synthase type 2 (PAPSS2) deficiency (apparent dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA] sulfotransferase deficiency)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia (LCAH) (see <a href=\"#H2642991429\" class=\"local\">'Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia'</a> below)</p><p/><p>ACRD and PAPSS2 deficiency are not strictly CAH disorders, since these conditions lack cortisol deficiency. In the lipoid CAH diseases, production of all steroids is low.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1698113\"><span class=\"h1\">CYP17A1 DEFICIENCIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cytochrome P450 17A1 enzyme (CYP17A1) catalyzes both the 17-hydroxylase reaction, which forms 17-hydroxysteroids, and the 17,20-lyase reaction, which cleaves 21-carbon 17-hydroxysteroids to 19-carbon 17-keto androgen precursors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52616\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52616 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Most defects in CYP17A1 impair both enzymatic activities and cause combined <span class=\"nowrap\">17-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase</span> deficiency (17OHD), which can be complete or partial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The prevalence appears to be highest in Brazil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency (ILD) is extremely rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], with only approximately six cases described.</p><p>CYP17A1 is expressed both in the human adrenal and gonads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and thus, these deficiencies are forms of CAH that impair both adrenal and gonadal function. ILD, in contrast, does not significantly lead to adrenal hyperplasia and is more a form of gonadal insufficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1698120\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmarks of 17OHD, first described in 1966 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], include hypertension and hypokalemia due to the accumulation of cortisol precursors with mineralocorticoid activity upstream of the block, plus sexual infantilism due to inability to synthesize androgens and estrogens. Unlike most other forms of CAH, mineralocorticoid excess and high corticosterone production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] mitigate the clinical consequences of cortisol deficiency, and symptomatic adrenal insufficiency is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/4,10-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10-16</a>].</p><p>CYP17A1 metabolizes pregnenolone, progesterone, and their 17-hydroxy derivatives early in the steroidogenic cascades (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52616\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52616 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Consequently, 17OHD eliminates the synthesis of most steroids and limits steroidogenesis to progesterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC), corticosterone, and 18-oxygenated derivatives (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F104126\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104126 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. DOC binds with high affinity to the mineralocorticoid receptor and is not a substrate for 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2. DOC excess causes volume expansion, hypertension, and kaluresis despite suppressed renin and aldosterone production.</p><p>The lack of 17,20-lyase activity precludes conversion of 21-carbon steroids to 19-carbon androgen precursors in both 17OHD and ILD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52616\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52616 \">figure 2</a>). In ILD, 17-hydroxylation is largely preserved, and DOC and corticosterone accumulation are limited; hence, hypertension and hypokalemia as clinical manifestations of 17OHD are not found. Low 19-carbon steroid production, however, causes variable degrees of genital ambiguity in affected 46,XY males with a tendency for gynecomastia during puberty, as occurs in many states of low testosterone synthesis. Affected girls develop only sparse pubic hair and can have dysmenorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520889525\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic presentation of <strong>severe</strong> 17OHD in phenotypic females (who can have 46,XX or 46,XY karyotype) includes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/3,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary amenorrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of secondary sexual characteristics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimal body hair</p><p/><p>The hypertension, which is typically detected in early adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], may be present much earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] and can be severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] but may be normalized with treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1698134\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>In <strong>partial</strong> forms of 17OHD, 46,XY patients are often identified in infancy due to ambiguous genitalia with intraabdominal or inguinal testes and a blind vaginal pouch similar to androgen insensitivity syndrome. Genotypic females have a small uterus and ovaries that may develop large cysts in adolescence due to high gonadotropins and progesterone. Since estrogens derive from androgens, estrogen synthesis is secondarily impaired, but since estradiol is an extremely potent inducer of breast development, particularly when androgens are low, some breast development may be seen. Biochemical evidence of a partial 17-hydroxylation defect may be observed without clinical manifestations of hypertension or hypokalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>ILD is generally diagnosed in males with undervirilization, gynecomastia, and failure to develop secondary sexual characteristics due to the testicular enzyme deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Females with ILD have been identified only in families with affected males; they present with delayed pubarche and oligomenorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520889511\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of 17OHD is established by demonstrating an elevated precursor-to-product ratio in serum at baseline or under cosyntropin stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Most of these other conditions are distinguished from 17OHD in that DOC is not elevated, and 11-hydroxylase deficiency (11OHD) is distinguished by the presence of low versus high androgens in 17OHD and 11OHD, respectively. The differential diagnosis of undervirilization in males is one of the most difficult in pediatric endocrinology and is discussed separately.

Urinary steroid profiling by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and molecular diagnostics are extremely useful methods for confirming the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>] but are not routinely available. In 17OHD, metabolites of DOC and corticosterone are elevated, while 17OHP and 19-carbon steroid metabolites are low; in ORD, metabolites of both 17OHP and corticosterone are characteristically elevated due to combined 21- and 17-hydroxylation defects, and 19-carbon steroids are also reduced.

The POR enzyme serves as an electron donor enzyme to cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum (microsomal or type II), which include steroidogenic enzymes (CYP17A1, CYP21A2, and CYP19A1 [aromatase]) and xenobiotic-metabolizing hepatic P450 enzymes.

In addition, patients may present with a complex, predominantly craniofacial pattern, resembling that previously described by Antley and Bixler [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>] and therefore termed Antley-Bixler syndrome (ABS).</p><p>ORD is not associated with mineralocorticoid deficiency, and in some patients, preferential inhibition of 17-hydroxylase over 21-hydroxylase by specific <em>POR</em> mutants may even result in mineralocorticoid accumulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. Mineralocorticoid-related hypertension is not a feature of ORD, although two young adults with ORD and coincident arterial hypertension have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In stark contrast to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) due to <em>CYP21A2</em> mutations, sex steroids in patients with ORD are low normal or decreased as a consequence of concomitant CYP17A1 dysfunction. The clinical presentation of ORD, however, comprises the entire spectrum of disorders of sex development (DSD) observed in both sexes. This spectrum includes undervirilization of genetically male individuals (46,XY DSD), varying from borderline micropenis to severe perineoscrotal hypospadias, and virilization of genetically female individuals (46,XX DSD), varying from mild clitoral hypertrophy to Prader IV to V virilization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52525\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52525 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p>The paradox of maternal virilization during pregnancy and severe neonatal virilization of affected girls with ORD despite postnatal androgen deficiency has been explained by activation of an alternative pathway towards the synthesis of dihydrotestosterone in neonatal life but ceasing shortly after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, some <em>POR</em> mutants may also affect aromatase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>], in particular R457H, the most frequently found mutation in the Japanese population, which is invariably associated with 46,XX DSD in homozygous neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/113,121\" class=\"abstract_t\">113,121</a>].</p><p>Pubertal development in ORD is not well studied yet.

Cystic ovaries and also larger ovarian cysts at risk of rupture are a common finding during early adolescence, as a consequence of gonadotropin upregulation due to sex steroid deficiency (similar to findings in 21-hydroxylase deficiency [17OHD]).</p><p>Malformations reported in patients affected by ORD comprise one type of ABS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]; the other type lacks disordered steroidogenesis. Skeletal malformations include craniofacial malformations such as midface hypoplasia with low-set ears and pear-shaped nose. Craniosynostosis in variable severity may require ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Frequently observed features include arachnodactyly, clinodactyly, and radiohumeral synostosis. In severely affected children, bowed femora with neonatal fractures and choanal atresia may be observed. The mechanism of ABS malformations probably derives from concomitant loss of lanosterol demethylase (CYP51A1) activity, an enzyme required for de novo cholesterol biosynthesis, which also uses POR as a co-factor. The loss of cholesterol synthesis during embryogenesis impairs signaling molecules important for body patterning and development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/113,114,122-126\" class=\"abstract_t\">113,114,122-126</a>].

Clinically, PAPSS2 deficiency presents in childhood with androgen excess resulting in premature pubarche that progresses to oligomenorrhea, secondary amenorrhea, hirsutism, and acne. The sulfonation defect exists in chondrocytes and also affects bone development, so that patients may present with bone dysplasia and associated malformation phenotype.</p><p>Adrenal DHEA is a major androgen precursor in women. Unconjugated DHEA can be metabolized to active androgens, whereas the conversion of DHEAS to androgens requires initial cleavage of the sulfate group. Most adrenal DHEA is sulfonated to DHEAS before entering the circulation, and interconversion between DHEA and DHEAS in the body favors DHEAS, due to high hepatic sulfonation activity. Thus, impaired DHEA sulfonation increases the amount of DHEA available for conversion to active androgen.</p><p>DHEA sulfotransferase (SULT2A1) is the major enzyme responsible for DHEA sulfonation, converting DHEA to DHEAS mainly in the adrenal glands and the liver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74694\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74694 \">figure 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/154\" class=\"abstract_t\">154</a>]. The sulfate donor PAPS is required by all sulfotransferases, including SULT2A1. In humans, PAPS is synthesized by the two isoforms of PAPS synthase, PAPSS1 and PAPSS2. PAPSS2 is predominantly expressed in the major sites of DHEA sulfation, adrenal and liver, while PAPSS1 is ubiquitously expressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>]. Both PAPS proteins have two domains associated with distinct enzymatic activities: the ATP sulfurylase domain converting ATP and sulfate to adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (APS), and the APS kinase domain that generates PAPS from APS and ATP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/154\" class=\"abstract_t\">154</a>].</p><p>The first patient with PAPSS2 deficiency identified due to androgen excess was a girl presenting with premature pubarche and advanced bone age at age six years, followed by progression to the phenotype observed in NCCAH, including oligomenorrhea, acne, hirsutism, and eventually secondary amenorrhea at the age of 13 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>]. Her circulating androgens, including androstenedione, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and DHEA were high, but DHEAS was below the detection limit of the assay, suggesting that impaired DHEA sulfonation was the cause of androgen excess. Detailed radiograph analysis of this girl showed mild bone dysplasia in the lumbar and thoracic spine but no involvement of the long bones; however, she had no clinical symptoms of bone dysplasia. Genetic analysis showed compound heterozygous mutations in the <em>PAPSS2</em> gene, which is located on chromosome 10 (10q22-q24): one missense mutation affecting the APS kinase domain and a nonsense mutation resulting in early truncation of the ATP sulfurylase domain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>].</p><p>A family with two postpubertal brothers who are compound heterozygotes for a null frame-shift allele and mutation G270D has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias/abstract/153,155\" class=\"abstract_t\">153,155</a>]. The mother, who is a carrier for the null allele, had chronic anovulation and enhanced conversion of DHEA to androgens. These findings suggest that heterozygous carriers might have clinical manifestations.</p><p>The goal of the treatment in PAPSS2 deficiency is the control of androgen excess and its clinical consequences. Glucocorticoid in moderate dose to lower adrenal androgens, as for apparent cortisone reductase deficiency (ACRD), is an option but risks overtreatment. Additional options include antiandrogens and oral contraceptive pills. Boys might not require treatment upon reaching adulthood, whereas women will likely require chronic therapy.

However, CYP11A1 is required for biosynthesis of progesterone, and placental progesterone synthesis from the syncytiotrophoblast, which is fetal tissue, is believed to be necessary for the maintenance of pregnancy.

Most defects in CYP17A1 impair both enzymatic activities and cause combined <span class=\"nowrap\">17-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase</span> deficiency (17OHD). These deficiencies impair both adrenal and gonadal function. The classic presentation of <strong>severe</strong> 17OHD includes hypertension, primary amenorrhea, absence of secondary sexual characteristics, and minimal body hair in phenotypic females, who can have 46,XX or 46,XY karyotype (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F104126\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104126 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52616\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52616 \">figure 2</a>). Approximately 100 different mutations in the <em>CYP17A1</em> gene, which is located on chromosome 10q24.3, have been identified. (See <a href=\"#H1698113\" class=\"local\">'CYP17A1 deficiencies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 deficiency</strong> <strong>(HSD3B2)</strong> &ndash; This is a rare form of CAH in which synthesis of all active steroid hormones is impaired. HSD3B2 catalyzes the reactions that establish the 3-keto-delta-4 A-ring structure found in the major endogenous progestins, mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens, including the precursors of dihydrotestosterone. This disorder impairs both adrenal and gonadal steroid production. Much like 21OHD, most patients present as neonates or in early infancy with clinical manifestations of both cortisol and aldosterone deficiency, with feeding difficulties, vomiting, volume depletion, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74160\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74160 \">figure 4</a>). Girls have mild androgen excess, due to the conversion of delta-5 steroids to active androgens via the type 1 isoenzyme in peripheral tissues. (See <a href=\"#H159859022\" class=\"local\">'3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency</strong> &ndash; Deficiency of CYP11B1, or 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency (11OHD), features the androgen excess of 21OHD and mineralocorticoid excess of 17OHD. The clinical manifestations of the disorder result from high adrenal production of the mineralocorticoid 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) and the adrenal androgen precursors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F64361\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64361 \">figure 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F104126\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104126 \">table 1</a>). Consequently, the two characteristic clinical features are hypertension with hypokalemia, as with any other form of mineralocorticoid excess and androgen excess. The autosomal recessive disorder 11OHD is caused by mutations of the <em>CYP11B1</em> gene, located on chromosome 8q21-q22. (See <a href=\"#H93046139\" class=\"local\">'11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>P450 oxidoreductase deficiency (apparent combined CYP17A1 and CYP21A2 deficiency)</strong> is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the flavoprotein co-factor of the enzymes CYP17A1, CYP21A2, and CYP19A1 (aromatase). The biochemical presentation of P450 oxidoreductase (POR) deficiency (ORD) is characterized by apparent combined partial CYP17A1 and CYP21A2 deficiencies. This disorder has two unique clinical features. First, affected neonates may present with severe undervirilization in boys and severe virilization in girls. In addition, patients may present with a complex, predominantly craniofacial skeletal dysplasias, termed Antley-Bixler syndrome (ABS). The goals of treatment in ORD are to replace glucocorticoid deficiency and to restore desired secondary sexual characteristics at the time of puberty (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53155\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53155 \">figure 3</a>).

ACRD clinically manifests with hyperandrogenism, manifesting as premature pubarche or with oligomenorrhea, acne, and hirsutism (similar to nonclassic 21OHD). (See <a href=\"#H1699880\" class=\"local\">'Hexose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency (apparent cortisone reductase deficiency)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>PAPSS2 deficiency (apparent DHEA sulfotransferase deficiency)</strong> is an extremely rare disorder characterized by apparent inability to convert the adrenal androgen precursor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) to its sulfate ester DHEAS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74694\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74694 \">figure 8</a>). Clinically, 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate synthase type 2 (PAPSS2) deficiency manifests with androgen excess resulting in premature pubarche and later by oligomenorrhea, secondary amenorrhea, hirsutism, and acne. However, failure to sulfonate also affects bone development, and patients may present with bone dysplasia and associated malformation phenotype. This disorder is due to mutations in the <em>PAPSS2</em> gene, which is located on chromosome 10 (10q22-q24). (See <a href=\"#H1699908\" class=\"local\">'PAPSS2 deficiency (apparent DHEA sulfotransferase deficiency)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia (LCAH)</strong> &ndash; LCAH,<strong> </strong>when complete, is the most severe form of CAH. Most cases are due to mutations in the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), which increases cholesterol transport from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. StAR is required for normal steroidogenesis in the adrenal cortex and gonads (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56021\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56021 \">figure 9</a>). Patients typically have severe combined adrenal insufficiency soon after birth, or occasionally later in infancy. Male infants usually have female external genitalia due to lack of testicular androgen production. Female patients occasionally undergo spontaneous partial pubertal development, and one patient has conceived and carried two normal children to term. A nonclassic form of LCAH with isolated cortisol deficiency also exists.
