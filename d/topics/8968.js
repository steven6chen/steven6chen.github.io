Delay in initial antimicrobial therapy in the emergency department (median delay of four hours) was associated with a worsening of these markers in about 15 percent of patients.

Delayed therapy was a greater risk factor than the isolation of a penicillin-resistant strain (OR 6.83; 95% CI 2.94-20.8) or a higher disease severity (OR 1.12; 95% CI 1.07-1.15) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective cohort study of 286 patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis, early and adequate administration of antimicrobial therapy in relation to the onset of overt signs of meningitis was independently associated with a favorable outcome, defined as mild or no disability (OR 11.2, 95% CI 4.4-32.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study of 119 adults with bacterial meningitis examined the association between mortality and the time elapsed between emergency department presentation and antimicrobial administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

It is important to note that antimicrobial therapy should <strong>not</strong> be delayed if imaging is performed prior to lumbar puncture.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical presentation &ndash; In the retrospective study of 119 adults with bacterial meningitis described above, the most dramatic clinical predictor of death was the absence of fever at presentation (OR 39.4, 95% CI 4.3-358.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This finding, along with other &quot;atypical features&quot; (eg, lack of headache or neck stiffness), accounts for some of the delay in making the diagnosis and initiating therapy. While a deliberate delay of therapy is never warranted, the diagnosis can be quite challenging in cases with atypical features. Lowering the threshold for initiation of therapy may be prudent, but there is no clear guideline that will identify bacterial meningitis in patients with atypical features without some risk of over-treatment. (See <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Prediction of risk'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delay due to imaging &ndash; An important cause of delayed therapy in patients with suspected bacterial meningitis is performance of a CT scan of the head to exclude an occult mass lesion or other findings that could lead to cerebral herniation during subsequent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Should LP be delayed by the need for cranial imaging in patients suspected of having bacterial meningitis, blood cultures should be obtained and antimicrobial agents should be administered empirically along with adjunctive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (if indicated) just prior to or concomitant with the first antibiotic dose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-to-prevent-neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dexamethasone to prevent neurologic complications of bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Although commonly performed, a screening CT scan of the head is <strong>not</strong> necessary in the majority of patients. In two large series, 3 to 5 percent of patients had a finding that was a contraindication to LP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Risk factors included a suspicious history (eg, immunocompromised state, history of previous central nervous system disease, or a seizure within the previous week) as well as certain findings on neurologic examination (eg, reduced level of consciousness, focal motor or cranial abnormalities, and papilledema).</p><p>In the retrospective study of 119 adults with bacterial meningitis noted above, withholding antimicrobial therapy until a CT scan and lumbar puncture were done was strongly associated with a delay of &gt;6 hours to the first dose of antibiotic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. What cannot be measured as easily is the number of excess doses of glucocorticoids and antimicrobials administered in patients without meningitis but with clinical features suggestive of meningitis at the time of presentation. Some excess treatment may be expected in order to optimize the outcome of patients with bacterial meningitis.</p><p>Although the use of antimicrobial therapy before LP has an adverse impact on the yield of CSF Gram stain and culture, a pathogen can still be identified in the CSF in the majority of patients up to several hours after the administration of antimicrobial agents, with the possible exception of meningococcal infection.

In an animal model of bacterial meningitis, bactericidal antimicrobial therapy resulted in optimal microbiologic cure and survival in animals with pneumococcal meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This principle is also supported by clinical observations of poor outcomes in patients receiving bacteriostatic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Drug entry into CSF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antimicrobial penetration into CSF depends to a large extent on the status of the blood-brain barrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. When the blood-brain barrier is normal, most beta-lactam agents (eg, penicillin) penetrate poorly. However, in the presence of meningeal inflammation, CSF penetration is enhanced likely as a result of separation of intercellular tight junctions and increased numbers of pinocytotic vesicles in cerebral microvascular endothelial cells. As inflammation subsides, antimicrobial entry decreases. Thus, maximal parenteral doses should be continued throughout the course of therapy to maintain adequate CSF concentrations. Antibiotic entry is also enhanced with drugs that have a high lipid solubility, low molecular weight, low protein binding, and low ionization at physiologic pH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

In some cases, higher doses of agents are used for bacterial meningitis than for other infections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60707\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60707 \">table 3B</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Pharmacodynamics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For antimicrobial agents that exhibit time-dependent antimicrobial activity (eg, beta-lactams, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>), the bactericidal activity depends upon the time that the agent is above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) as a proportion of the dosing interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. For agents that exhibit concentration-dependent antimicrobial activity (eg, aminoglycosides), killing occurs over a wide range of antimicrobial concentrations and there is a prolonged recovery period (ie, the postantibiotic effect) after drug concentrations fall below the MIC during which regrowth of bacteria is delayed. The CSF pharmacodynamics of fluoroquinolones are more complicated, however, and features of both time dependency and concentration dependency have been described.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antimicrobial selection must be empiric immediately after CSF is obtained or when lumbar puncture is delayed.

A consensus conference recommended empiric antimicrobial therapy in all patients with clinical and laboratory features suggestive of postoperative meningitis; such therapy can be discontinued at 48 to 72 hours if the CSF culture is negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>The safety of this approach has not been assessed in randomized trials but was evaluated in a cohort study of patients with meningitis at different time periods following neurosurgery or ear, nose, and throat surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Between 1998 and most of 2003, the control period, guidelines were lacking or not implemented. From the end of 2003 through mid-2005, an interventional protocol was followed in which predefined intravenous antimicrobial therapy was discontinued on the third day if the meningitis was considered aseptic as defined by a negative CSF culture. There were 21 cases of bacterial meningitis and 54 of aseptic meningitis; no patient had an intracranial device. The duration of therapy was not different in the two time periods for bacterial meningitis but was significantly shorter with the interventional protocol in the later period for aseptic meningitis (3.5 versus 11.5 days). All episodes of meningitis were cured, and complications were rare during both time periods.</p><p>An important limitation to this observational study is that it is unclear how many patients received perioperative antimicrobial therapy. This could have major implications for a negative CSF bacterial culture postoperatively, since the CSF may be infected but partially treated. For this reason, cessation of antimicrobial therapy is <strong>not</strong> recommended in patients who have received prior or are receiving concurrent antimicrobial therapy with a negative CSF culture and who are suspected of having bacterial meningitis based on clinical and laboratory findings (eg, CSF pleocytosis).</p><p>Infections of CSF shunts and other devices are discussed separately.

Another method that has been evaluated for reducing ICP is oral administration of the hyperosmolar agent, glycerol. However, a randomized trial in adults with bacterial meningitis in Malawi (a resource-poor country with high HIV prevalence) was stopped early because planned interim analysis demonstrated increased mortality by day 40 in the glycerol group (63 versus 49 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The reason for this finding is unclear but might relate to an increased incidence of seizures in the patients who received glycerol. Another possible reason could be a rebound increase in ICP as the drug is eliminated, although ICP was not monitored in this trial.

The mortality rate of untreated disease approaches 100 percent and, even with optimal therapy, there is a high failure rate. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If possible, crucial historical information (eg, serious drug allergies, recent exposure to an individual with meningitis) should be obtained before antibiotic treatment of presumed bacterial meningitis is instituted. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial blood tests should include two sets of blood cultures. The initial approach to management in a patient with suspected bacterial meningitis includes performance of a lumbar puncture (LP) to determine whether the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings are consistent with the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50114\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef50114 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are three general requirements of antimicrobial therapy for bacterial meningitis: use of bactericidal drugs effective against the infecting organism, use of drugs that enter the CSF, and use of drugs with optimal pharmacodynamics. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that antimicrobial therapy be initiated immediately after the performance of the lumbar puncture or, if a computed tomography (CT) scan is to be performed before LP, immediately after blood cultures are obtained (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Adjunctive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> should be given shortly before or at the same time as the first dose of antibiotics, when indicated. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Avoidance of delay'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For adults in the developed world with suspected bacterial meningitis in whom the organism is unknown or <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae </em>is confirmed, we recommend administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Dexamethasone should be continued if the CSF Gram stain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the CSF or blood cultures reveal <em>S. pneumoniae</em>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rifampin</a> is added to the regimen in patients receiving dexamethasone under certain circumstances. This is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-to-prevent-neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dexamethasone to prevent neurologic complications of bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the CSF Gram stain results are available, the antimicrobial regimen should be tailored to cover the most likely pathogen. If the CSF findings are consistent with the diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis but the Gram stain is negative, empiric antibiotic therapy should be continued. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Regimens based upon Gram stain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The antibiotic regimen should be modified further, when indicated, based on the CSF culture and susceptibility results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-bacterial-meningitis-caused-by-specific-pathogens-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by specific pathogens in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h2\">Empiric antimicrobial therapy</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antimicrobial selection must be empiric immediately after CSF is obtained or when lumbar puncture is delayed.
