The infection is usually caused by bacteria, such as staphylococci (&quot;Staph&quot;) or streptococci (&quot;Strep&quot;) that are commonly present on the skin or inner surface of the nose or mouth of otherwise normal and healthy people. The infection develops when there is a break in the skin, such as a wound or athlete's foot, which may be minor or even unnoticed. This allows bacteria to enter the skin and grow, causing infection and swelling.</p><p>Many cases of cellulitis are mild and the involved skin clears completely with antibiotic treatment. However, some cases of cellulitis can be severe and lead to generalized infection. Thus, it is important to seek medical care promptly if the infection is associated with fever, rapid worsening of skin changes, other signs of progression, or if you have other medical problems, such as diabetes.</p><p>This topic discusses the symptoms and treatment of cellulitis. Other skin infections are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-mrsa-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=animal-and-human-bites-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Animal and human bites (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SKIN INFECTION RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain conditions increase the risk of developing cellulitis. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recent injury to the skin (a wound, abrasion, cut, shaving, or injection drug use)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior radiation therapy to the area</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of a fungal or viral skin infection, such as athlete's foot or chickenpox</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accumulation of fluid (edema) due to poor circulation, heart failure, liver disease, or past surgery to remove lymph nodes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being overweight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic skin conditions, such as eczema</p><p/><p>However, cellulitis can also develop in people who have no known risk factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellulitis-and-skin-abscess-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellulitis and skin abscess: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SKIN INFECTION SYMPTOMS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cellulitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptom of cellulitis is dull pain or tenderness in the area of skin involvement. Other cellulitis symptoms can include swelling, warmth, and redness in a distinct area of skin. These symptoms commonly worsen, and the redness may expand over the course of hours or days. The onset of cellulitis may be gradual or sudden. Itching is not a typical symptom of cellulitis. The skin is usually smooth and shiny rather than raised or bumpy. However, occasionally in cases of cellulitis, blisters or small pimples may form in the skin.</p><p>Cellulitis most commonly involves the leg; other common sites include the arm, around the eye, the breast, and on the abdominal wall. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellulitis-following-pelvic-lymph-node-dissection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellulitis following pelvic lymph node dissection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cellulitis-and-other-skin-disorders-of-the-breast\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast cellulitis and other skin disorders of the breast&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Other skin infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other types of skin infections include abscesses, furuncles (&quot;boils&quot;), and carbuncles. These usually cause a collection of pus under the skin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellulitis-and-skin-abscess-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellulitis and skin abscess: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Skin that is raised, reddened, tender, and pus filled may be caused by a skin infection known as methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>(MRSA). This is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-mrsa-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DO I NEED TO BE EXAMINED?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many types and causes of skin infections, and it is important to know the most likely cause of the infection before beginning treatment. Using the wrong treatment could allow the infection to worsen. To ensure that the correct treatment is used, it is important to be evaluated by a healthcare provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SKIN INFECTION TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cellulitis treatment includes antibiotics as well as treatment of any underlying condition that led to the skin infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Elevate the area</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevating the arm or leg above the level of the heart can help to reduce swelling and speed healing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Keep the area clean and dry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to keep the infected area clean and dry. You can shower or bathe normally and pat the area dry with a clean towel. You can use a bandage or gauze to protect the skin if needed. Do not use any antibiotic ointments or creams.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with cellulitis are treated with an antibiotic that is taken by mouth for 5 to 14 days. The &quot;best&quot; antibiotic depends upon an evaluation by your healthcare provider as to the likely bacterial cause of cellulitis in your case.</p><p>If the infection is severe, you may need to be hospitalized and treated with antibiotics given through a vein (intravenously, or IV).</p><p>It is important to take the antibiotic exactly as recommended and to finish the entire course of treatment. Skipping doses or ending treatment early could potentially allow the bacteria to become resistant and require longer treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Time to heal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resolution of fever and chills, if they were present, should occur within one to two days after starting antibiotic therapy. Local findings of swelling, warmth, and redness should begin to improve within one to three days after starting antibiotics, although these symptoms can persist for two weeks. If the reddened area becomes larger, more swollen, or more tender, call your healthcare provider. He or she may want to reexamine you to determine if further testing or an alternate antibiotic are needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84511383\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission to others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most forms of cellulitis are not highly contagious to other family members. However, when you have cellulitis, it is important to wash your hands regularly with soap and water and to avoid sharing towels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SKIN INFECTION PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, you will recover completely from an episode of cellulitis without any complications. If you have skin infection risk factors (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Skin infection risk factors'</a> above), talk to your healthcare provider to determine if there are steps you can take to minimize the risk of developing another bout of cellulitis in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=3993\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
