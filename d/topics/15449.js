In the United States, the prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Patients with ESRD consume a disproportionate share of health care resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>] and experience significant mortality and morbidity and a reduced quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>].</p><p>The identification and management of patients who have early stages of CKD may slow or prevent the progression to ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews recommendations for population-based CKD screening and case finding. Overviews of the epidemiology and management of CKD and its complications are discussed elsewhere.

The detection of CKD also identifies an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction in young men and women&quot;, section on 'Coronary risk factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevalence of and risk factors for coronary heart disease in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Early detection of CKD with reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may also facilitate appropriate dosing of medications and allow timely preparation for renal replacement, which may improve outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H3635268832\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Consequences of late referral'</a>.)</p><p>CKD is generally under-recognized, particularly among certain patient subsets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]. In one study of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2003 to 2004, among patients with estimated GFR (eGFR) 45 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, awareness of kidney disease was reported in only 9.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Awareness was increased among those with proteinuria, diabetes, or hypertension and among men compared with women.</p><p>More recent data suggest that awareness of CKD depends on how the question is asked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Asking multiple questions about the possible presence of kidney disease led to a higher apparent prevalence than when only one question was asked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This suggests that earlier studies, which were based on a single question, may have underestimated the true prevalence of awareness. In addition, there is some evidence that the proportion of people with CKD who are aware of their kidney disease is increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. However, awareness of CKD appears lower than awareness of other chronic conditions such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H899786122\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO SCREENING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H49433465\"><span class=\"h2\">Case finding versus widespread population screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest a case-finding approach to CKD screening rather than widespread population screening. Case finding is a strategy that tests for CKD only in people who are at increased risk. This approach effectively identifies individuals who may benefit from intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Although population-based screening would almost certainly detect individuals who have no identified risk factors but are at risk for progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>], a very large number of individuals would need to be tested and treated in order to possibly prevent one case of ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>].</p><p>This was demonstrated in the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease (PREVEND) Study, in which 40,854 individuals in the Netherlands aged 28 to 75 years were screened for increased urinary albumin excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Almost half of the individuals who ultimately required renal replacement therapy (RRT) had moderately increased albuminuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Testing only high-risk individuals identified 55 percent of those with moderately increased albuminuria and 87 percent of those who progressed to ESRD. Because 40 to 50 percent of individuals with moderately increased albuminuria did not have risk factors for CKD, the authors advocated screening the general population rather than targeting screening to those at increased risk. However, among 25,597 PREVEND participants who did not have any risk factors for CKD, there were only six cases of ESRD.</p><p>In addition, although the relatively low cost of testing urine for moderately increased albuminuria favors population-based screening, the total cost of the screening program is actually higher since it includes the time and effort to collect specimens, the cost of confirmatory tests for treatment of a positive test, and the costs of monitoring and treatment of complications associated with interventions.</p><p>Finally, there is no direct evidence that a therapeutic intervention such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists decreases the risk of ESRD or a clinically significant loss of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) among individuals who have moderately increased albuminuria but no other risk factors.</p><p>In a cost-effectiveness analysis performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CKD screening using a test for moderately increased albuminuria was cost effective only for individuals with diabetes or hypertension or aged older than 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>However, a more recent systematic review suggested that CKD screening is cost effective in patients with diabetes and hypertension and probably in populations with higher incidences of CKD, rapid rates of progression, and more effective drug therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Since African Americans are at higher risk for ESRD, a CKD screening strategy may be more cost effective for African Americans than for non-African Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease#H19652768\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Racial variations in prevalence of ESRD and CKD'</a>). Despite this, in order to be economically attractive, screening needs to improve clinical outcomes compared with no screening, which remains to be conclusively shown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has concluded that evidence is insufficient to assess benefits and screening of asymptomatic adults (excluding testing for and monitoring as part of the management of chronic diseases such as diabetes or hypertension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends against screening for CKD in asymptomatic adults who do not have risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], although the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) strongly recommends regular screening for kidney disease, even in the absence of risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This discrepancy between recommendations from generalist and disease-based specialty organizations is also observed for many other conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H470938791\"><span class=\"h2\">Who should be tested?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We believe that patients who are at risk for developing CKD should be evaluated with a urine test for proteinuria and a blood test for creatinine to estimate GFR. However, the ACP has recommended that patients with or without diabetes who are already taking either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) should not be tested for proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], although this recommendation is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Patients who are at risk for glomerulonephritis should be screened for hematuria with a urinalysis. (See <a href=\"#H2666200\" class=\"local\">'Methods of testing for CKD'</a> below.)</p><p>We recommend that all individuals be assessed for CKD risk as part of routine health examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,32</a>]. This is consistent with recommendations of the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) guidelines for CKD, which have been reviewed and endorsed by the 2006 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Controversies Conference and the KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>The presence of the following risk factors should provoke formal testing for CKD in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis C virus infection, malignancy, autoimmune diseases, nephrolithiasis, or recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indigenous origin (including Native Americans) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sickle cell trait (SCT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]</p><p/><p>Formal testing for CKD may also be performed in people with multiple cardiovascular risk factors but without known CVD, although the number of risk factors that should prompt such testing is unknown (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-our-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention: Our approach&quot;</a>). Evaluation for CKD may be of benefit among adults living in areas where CKD incidence is unusually high (&quot;CKD hotspots&quot;), such as certain regions of Central America, Sri Lanka, and the Balkans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>].

Similar CKD screening strategies have been undertaken globally, including adaptations of the KEEP program in Japan and Mexico, the SeeCKD program in Canada, and the Kidney Evaluation for You program in Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/61-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3677749855\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Early detection of CKD might also facilitate appropriate dosing of medications and allow timely preparation for renal replacement, which may improve outcome. (See <a href=\"#H10268505\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2309893548\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest evaluating high-risk individuals for CKD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Important risk factors for CKD include diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD); other risk factors to be considered include a positive family history for kidney disease, Aboriginal origin, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis C virus infection, sickle cell trait (SCT), malignancy, autoimmune diseases, nephrolithiasis, and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). (See <a href=\"#H899786122\" class=\"local\">'Approach to screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are selected for CKD evaluation should have a urine test for albumin in a random urine sample and a blood test for creatinine to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Additional testing, such as renal ultrasonography, may be required in selected individuals (eg, in patients with a family history of polycystic kidney disease). (See <a href=\"#H2666200\" class=\"local\">'Methods of testing for CKD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of testing for CKD in high-risk groups has not been rigorously studied, and recommendations are opinion based. We suggest that diabetic patients are tested on a yearly basis and hypertensive patients at diagnosis, upon initiation of therapy, and every three years thereafter. Individuals with a family history of CKD should be tested every three years. (See <a href=\"#H946508198\" class=\"local\">'Frequency of testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H421308255\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Brian JG Pereira, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">National Kidney Foundation.
