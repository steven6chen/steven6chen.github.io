Issues related to hyponatremia in heart failure will be reviewed here. An overview of the treatment of hyponatremia is presented separately.

When cardiac output and systemic blood pressure are reduced, &quot;hypovolemic&quot; hormones, such as renin (with a subsequent increase in angiotensin II formation), antidiuretic hormone (ADH), and norepinephrine, respond [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Although edematous patients with heart failure have increased plasma and extracellular fluid volumes, the body perceives volume depletion (reduced effective arterial blood volume) since the low cardiac output decreases the pressure perfusing the baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and the renal afferent arteriole. <span class=\"utd-adt-cnt utd-adt-pathwys\">(Related Pathway(s): <a href=\"/icg/109142?topicRef=2321&amp;source=see_link\" target=\"_blank\">Hyponatremia: Evaluation in adults</a>.)</span></p><p>The degree of neurohumoral activation is generally related to the severity of cardiac dysfunction, as assessed by left ventricular ejection fraction or functional class [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The neurohumoral changes limit both sodium and water excretion in an attempt to return perfusion pressure to normal. ADH release directly enhances water reabsorption in the collecting tubules, whereas angiotensin II and norepinephrine limit distal water delivery (and thereby water excretion) by lowering the glomerular filtration rate (due to a marked reduction in renal perfusion) and by increasing proximal sodium and water reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, both the low cardiac output and high angiotensin II levels are potent stimuli to thirst, leading to enhanced water intake.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREDICTOR OF ADVERSE PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release and the associated reduction in the serum sodium concentration <strong>parallel the severity</strong> of the heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This relationship has prognostic importance since patient survival is significantly reduced (in comparison with normonatremic patients) once the serum sodium concentration falls below 137 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55554\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55554 \">figure 1</a>), and even mild hyponatremia is associated with an adverse prognosis following an acute myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. A similar inverse correlation exists between patient survival and the degree of elevation in serum norepinephrine levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62001\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62001 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=predictors-of-survival-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Predictors of survival in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;, section on 'Neurohumoral activation and heart rate'</a>.)</p><p>Patients whose serum sodium levels fall below 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> solely as a result of heart failure usually have near end-stage disease. Patients with heart failure who have this severity of hyponatremia also frequently have hyperkalemia. Distal sodium and water delivery are so low in advanced cardiac disease that potassium excretion (primarily dependent upon distal potassium secretion) falls below the level of intake.</p><p>In addition to its long-term prognostic value, hyponatremia is an adverse predictor of short-term outcomes in patients who are hospitalized for worsening heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. This was illustrated in a post-hoc analysis from the Outcomes of a Prospective Trial of Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milrinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Milrinone</a> for Exacerbations of Chronic Heart Failure (OPTIME-CHF) trial of milrinone therapy in 949 such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients in the lowest quintile of serum sodium (mean 134 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> [range 132 to 135 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L])</span> had significant increases in mortality both in-hospital (5.9 versus 1 to 2.3 percent in the other quartiles) and at 30 days (15.9 versus 6.4 to 7.8 percent).

In this setting of advanced heart failure and a high level of circulating vasoconstrictors, there is increased renal secretion of vasodilator prostaglandins which act to preserve renal perfusion and to lower systemic vascular resistance. Decreasing prostaglandin synthesis with an NSAID in such a patient is likely to cause renal ischemia, a rise in the serum creatinine concentration, and a fall in cardiac output due to increased afterload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

In patients with severely noncompliant hearts (ie, diastolic dysfunction), restricting water intake may have a second benefit, minimizing acute increases in intravascular volume that can promote the development of pulmonary congestion.</p><p>Despite these potential benefits, significantly limiting water intake is often not well tolerated in heart-failure patients because the reduction in tissue perfusion that enhances antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release also stimulates thirst.

Only tolvaptan and conivaptan are currently available in the United States; both are approved for the treatment of hyponatremia in patients with heart failure. However, tolvaptan should <strong>not</strong> be used for longer than 30 days and should <strong>not</strong> be given to patients with liver disease (including cirrhosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

A greater than 2.5-fold increase in liver enzymes was more common among patients who received tolvaptan compared with placebo. Based upon these and other data, the US FDA determined that tolvaptan should <strong>not</strong> be used in any patient for longer than 30 days and should <strong>not</strong> be used at all in patients with liver disease (including cirrhosis) because it may potentially lead to liver failure or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overly rapid correction of the hyponatremia can lead to irreversible neurologic injury.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is <strong>no</strong> evidence that correction of hyponatremia improves the hemodynamic abnormalities associated with the severe underlying chronic heart failure or that it improves clinical outcomes. Thus, the main indications for specific therapy to correct hyponatremia are a serum sodium concentration below 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> (severe hyponatremia) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of symptoms that might be due to hyponatremia.
