Important risk factors for development of diabetic foot infections include neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, and poor glycemic control. In the setting of sensory neuropathy, there is diminished perception of pain and temperature; thus, many patients are slow to recognize the presence of an injury to their feet. Autonomic neuropathy can cause diminished sweat secretion resulting in dry, cracked skin that facilitates the entry of microorganisms to the deeper skin structures. In addition, motor neuropathy can lead to foot deformities, which lead to pressure-induced soft tissue damage. Peripheral artery disease can impair blood flow necessary for healing of ulcers and infections. Hyperglycemia impairs neutrophil function and reduces host defenses. Trauma in patients with one or more of these risk factors precipitates development of wounds that can be slow to heal and predispose to secondary infection.</p><p>The microbiology, clinical evaluation, diagnosis, and management of diabetic foot infections will be reviewed here. The general evaluation of the diabetic foot and management of uninfected diabetic foot lesions are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the diabetic foot&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of diabetic foot ulcers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H905751\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF APPROACH TO THE PATIENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2012, the Infectious Disease Society of America updated guidelines on the diagnosis and management of diabetic foot infections, which were originally published in 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Practical guidelines are also published regularly by the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The information reviewed in this topic is largely consistent with these guidelines.</p><p>The evaluation of a patient with a diabetic foot infection involves three key steps: 1) determining the extent and severity of infection, 2) identifying underlying factors that predispose to and promote infection, and 3) assessing the microbial etiology. </p><p>The clinical history should focus on the details related to recent trauma, the duration of the current lesion(s), associated systemic symptoms, and prior treatment, if any. Mechanical factors that may predispose to the formation of an ulcer should be noted, and the history of blood glucose control should be assessed. Evidence of systemic toxicity should also be carefully noted.</p><p>Clinical examination should note the location of the lesions, extent of infection (eg, involving skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscles, tendons <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bone) and whether bone is grossly visible or palpable by probing. Although osteomyelitis is highly likely if bone is visible, it may be present in the absence of such findings. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of underlying osteomyelitis'</a> below.)</p><p>Clinical examination should also include a neurologic evaluation that documents the extent of sensory loss as well as a vascular evaluation of the presence and severity of arterial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> venous insufficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the diabetic foot&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Laboratory evaluation should include complete blood count as well as measurement of blood glucose, electrolytes, and renal function. Baseline and subsequent inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) can be useful for monitoring response to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>] but not all studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] have suggested that procalcitonin (PCT), a novel inflammatory marker, may also be useful if laboratory facilities that test this substance are locally available; further investigation is needed to determine the clinical utility of this assay. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of underlying osteomyelitis'</a> below.)</p><p>Initial evaluation should include conventional radiographs to evaluate for bony deformity, foreign bodies, and gas in the soft tissue. In select cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be performed to better evaluate for soft tissue abnormalities and osteomyelitis. (See <a href=\"#H12048040\" class=\"local\">'Osteomyelitis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to imaging modalities in the setting of suspected osteomyelitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Aerobic and anaerobic cultures of deep tissue or bone biopsies should be obtained at the time of debridement if deep tissue infection or osteomyelitis is suspected. (See <a href=\"#H906271\" class=\"local\">'Obtaining samples for culture'</a> below.)</p><p>If surgical intervention is warranted for management of infection, formal neurological <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vascular evaluation is important for determining the extent of surgical intervention.

The microbiology of diabetic foot wounds is variable depending on the extent of involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/4,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8-10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superficial diabetic foot infections (including cellulitis and infected ulcers in antibiotic-na&iuml;ve individuals) are likely due to aerobic gram-positive cocci (including <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Streptococcus agalactiae</em>, <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>, and coagulase-negative staphylococci). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ulcers that are deep, chronically infected, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> previously treated with antibiotics are more likely to be polymicrobial. Such wounds may involve the above organisms in addition to enterococci, Enterobacteriaceae, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, and anaerobes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wounds with extensive local inflammation, necrosis, malodorous drainage, or gangrene with signs of systemic toxicity should be presumed to have anaerobic organisms in addition to the above pathogens. Potential pathogens include anaerobic streptococci, <em>Bacteroides</em> species, and <em>Clostridium</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>].</p><p/><p>The typical microbiological spectrum also differs by geographic location, with gram-negative pathogens predominating in the sub-tropical climates of Africa and Asia, in contrast to the predominantly gram-positive organisms seen in the Western hemisphere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4124489\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of specific organisms</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4124497\"><span class=\"h3\">Resistant Staphylococcus aureus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) is a common pathogen in diabetic foot infections, particularly in those who have had previous MRSA infections or known colonization. Other risk factors for MRSA infection include prior antibiotic use, previous hospitalization, and residence in a long-term care facility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-mrsa-in-adults-epidemiology#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in adults: Epidemiology&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>It is also important to note that diabetic patients with chronic foot wounds who receive repeated and prolonged courses of antibiotics represent an important risk group for development of vancomycin-intermediate <em>S. aureus</em> infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-with-reduced-susceptibility-to-vancomycin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4124514\"><span class=\"h3\">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>P. aeruginosa</em> is a particularly prevalent organism in diabetic foot infections reported from regions with warm climates. As an example, in a study of 434 patients with infected diabetic foot ulcers in Northern India, <em>P. aeruginosa</em> was the most common isolate, found in 20 percent of initial cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Macerated ulcers, foot soaking, and other exposure to water or moist environments also likely increases the risk of involvement with <em>P. aeruginosa</em>. However, in temperate climates and in the absence of the preceding findings and exposures, <em>P. aeruginosa</em> is a relatively uncommon pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Furthermore, its role as a pathogen in routine clinical practice is often hard to assess. As an example, when <em>P. aeruginosa</em> was isolated from participants of clinical studies of diabetic foot infections, most patients improved on antibiotic regimens that did not cover <em>Pseudomonas</em>, suggesting that it was not the primary pathogenic organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4124592\"><span class=\"h3\">Resistant enteric gram-negative rods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gram-negative bacilli that express an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) are increasing in prevalence worldwide. These pathogens are more common in patients with prolonged hospital stays, prolonged catheterization, prior antibiotic use, or residence in a long-term care facility (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>). The involvement of ESBL-producing organisms in diabetic foot infections in particular is also increasingly reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetic foot infections can develop as a result of neuropathic or ischemic ulcers, traumatic wounds, skin cracks or fissures, or other defects in the skin of the foot or nail beds (paronychia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/2,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,24</a>]. Thus, infection can present as localized superficial skin involvement at the site of a preexisting lesion or as infection of the skin or deeper skin structures that has spread beyond the site of local trauma. Such infections can subsequently extend to joints, bones, and the systemic circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Diabetic foot infections are often accompanied by the cardinal manifestations of inflammation (erythema, warmth, swelling, and tenderness) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of pus in an ulcer or sinus tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, these local signs of infection may not be evident in all cases. Infections may not manifest with warmth and erythema in the setting of severe ischemia. Diabetics with sensory neuropathy may have diminished sensation in the involved area and therefore may not complain of tenderness nor, in some cases, even realize that infection is present. In such instances, infection may progress to involve deeper tissues before the patient seeks clinical attention. </p><p>Other local signs that may be present in diabetic foot infections are nonspecific and include nonpurulent drainage, friable or discolored granulation tissue, and undermining of wound edges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Cutaneous bullae, soft tissue gas, skin discoloration, or a foul odor may occur in necrotizing infections. Findings of gangrene, severe ischemia, or tissue necrosis may denote the presence of a limb-threatening infection. </p><p>Systemic signs such as fever, chills, hypotension, and tachycardia may accompany local signs of infection, and their presence indicates an increased severity of infection.

Several clinical features are associated with the presence of underlying osteomyelitis in patients with diabetic foot ulcers, including ulcer size &gt;2 cm<sup>2</sup> and depth allowing visibly exposed bone or ability to probe to bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. The presence of a &quot;sausage&quot; toe, with erythema and nonpitting edema that obliterates the normal contour of the digit, has been associated with underlying osteomyelitis in diabetic patients, but the frequency of this finding is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Although not specific or highly sensitive, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) may be useful in evaluating whether osteomyelitis is present. The finding of an ESR of 70 or greater increases the clinical probability that osteomyelitis is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>On plain radiographs, findings characteristic of osteomyelitis include cortical erosion, periosteal reaction, mixed lucency, and sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/2,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,28</a>]. There is often also evidence of soft tissue swelling. However, radiographs may be normal or have only subtle non-specific findings early in infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of osteomyelitis include cortical destruction, bone marrow edema, and soft tissue inflammation.

The presence of two or more features of inflammation (erythema, warmth, tenderness, swelling, induration and purulent secretions) can establish the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/2,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,31</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.) </p><p>As many diabetic foot wounds are colonized by bacteria, the presence of microbial growth from a wound culture in the absence of supportive clinical findings is not sufficient to make the diagnosis of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/2,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis of underlying osteomyelitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The possibility of osteomyelitis should be considered in diabetic patients with foot wounds associated with signs of infection in the deeper soft tissues and in patients with chronic ulcers, particularly those overlying bony prominences that do not heal after several weeks of wound care and off-loading. The diagnosis of osteomyelitis is definitively made through isolation of bacteria from a sterilely obtained bone biopsy sample with histologic evidence of inflammation and osteonecrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/2,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,31</a>]. However, bone biopsy is not always routinely available or practical. In such instances, the presumptive diagnosis is based on clinical and radiographic assessment. </p><p>Certain clinical findings can support the diagnosis of osteomyelitis. In two systematic reviews that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of exam findings in the setting of diabetic foot ulcers, the following factors increase the likelihood of osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grossly visible bone or ability to probe to bone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ulcer size larger than 2 cm<sup>2</sup></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ulcer duration longer than one to two weeks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) &gt;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/h</span></p><p/><p>If bone is grossly visible, supportive radiographic findings may not be necessary to make a diagnosis of osteomyelitis. However, for diabetic patients with one or more of the other above factors, a conventional radiograph with consistent changes can be helpful in making the diagnosis of osteomyelitis and providing a baseline image useful for subsequent management decisions. If the radiograph is indeterminate or normal and the diagnosis remains uncertain, such patients should undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is highly sensitive and specific for osteomyelitis and superior to radiographs, three-phase bone scans, and white blood cell scans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/2,28,29,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,28,29,31,32</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12048040\" class=\"local\">'Osteomyelitis'</a> above.)</p><p>In cases of diagnostic uncertainty based on clinical or radiographic features, failure of empiric antibiotic therapy, planned hardware placement in potentially infected bone, and mid- or hindfoot lesions that could lead to high-level amputations if inadequately treated, obtaining a bone sample to establish diagnosis is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

In its 2004 guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of diabetic foot infections, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) first outlined a clinical classification scheme to define levels of severity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55551\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55551 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Briefly, it classifies diabetic foot changes as uninfected, mild, moderate, and severe based on the extent of inflammatory findings, the tissue depth involved, and the presence of signs of systemic toxicity. The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot published a nearly identical classification system in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The prognostic value of such classification schema was assessed in a longitudinal study of 1666 persons with diabetes; there was a trend toward increased amputation risk among patients with more severe infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of diabetic foot infections requires attentive wound management, good nutrition, appropriate antimicrobial therapy, glycemic control, and fluid and electrolyte balance. Although severe infections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55551\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55551 \">table 1</a>) warrant hospitalization for urgent surgical consultation, antimicrobial administration, and medical stabilization, most mild infections and many moderate infections can be managed in the outpatient setting with close follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/12,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,21</a>].

A wide array of dressing and wound healing products for ulcer management has been developed. These products include enzymes, gels, hydrocolloids, honey and antiseptics containing iodine or silver salts. However, the efficacy of these agents has not been evaluated or compared in carefully designed studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/24,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,38</a>].

Various devices to relieve pressure on the foot are available, including casts and special shoes. The choice of device should be based on the wound location, the severity of infection, and the presence of peripheral arterial disease.

In patients with mild infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55551\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55551 \">table 1</a>) in whom there is low suspicion for resistant organisms (eg, no recent antibiotic course), wound culture is often not necessary.

Ideally, samples for culture should be obtained prior to the initiation of empiric antibiotics. However, in cases of systemic toxicity or limb-threatening infections, antibiotic therapy should not be withheld before surgical cultures are obtained.</p><p>The preferred clinical specimens for reliable culture include aspirate from an abscess or curettage from the ulcer base following superficial debridement of necrotic tissue.

Patients with mild infection should receive oral antibiotic therapy in conjunction with attentive wound care until there is evidence that the infection has resolved (usually about one to two weeks). Antibiotics need not be administered for the entire duration that the wound remains open [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/2,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,31</a>].</p><p>Patients with infection also requiring surgical debridement should receive intravenous antibiotic therapy perioperatively.

In one retrospective study of diabetic patients with osteomyelitis of the toe or metatarsal head, remission (absence of signs of infection and no need for surgery after one year) was more likely in the 22 patients treated with regimens guided by bone biopsy data compared with the 28 treated based on swab culture data (82 versus 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Of note, those who had bone culture were also more likely to be treated with a rifampicin-containing regimen, which likely was a confounding variable and limits the interpretation of this finding. </p><p>For those patients who were initiated on parenteral therapy, a switch to an oral regimen is reasonable following clinical improvement. Antibiotic therapy for osteomyelitis is discussed in detail elsewhere.</p><p>Many patients with osteomyelitis of the foot benefit from surgical resection. In a systematic review of studies evaluating treatment of diabetic foot osteomyelitis, there was no study that directly compared surgical intervention to nonsurgical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. However, studies of prolonged antibiotic therapy without resection reported success rates comparable to those reported with surgery, about 60 to 90 percent. Furthermore, partial amputations of the foot (eg, ray or transmetatarsal amputations) may adversely alter the biomechanics of the foot, increasing the risk of future ulceration. Thus, in certain cases, limited surgical debridement combined with prolonged antibiotic therapy may be appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/2,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,31</a>].

If all infected and necrotic bone and soft tissue has been resected (eg, amputation), then a brief course (ie, about a week) of antibiotics is likely adequate. Otherwise, the optimal duration is uncertain. Four to six weeks is an appropriate course if there is residual infected bone following debridement of necrotic bone.

Wound healing and a decrease in previously elevated inflammatory markers can be signs of clinical resolution, and may be particularly helpful in cases of osteomyelitis. If clinical evidence of infection persists beyond the expected duration, issues of patient adherence to therapy, development of antibiotic resistance, an undiagnosed deeper infection (eg, abscess or osteomyelitis), or ischemia should be evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>If infection in a clinically stable patient fails to respond to more than one antibiotic course, some favor discontinuing antimicrobial therapy to optimize the yield of culture specimens obtained a few days later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of diabetic foot infections requires attentive wound management, good nutrition, antimicrobial therapy, glycemic control, and fluid and electrolyte balance. Wound management includes attentive local wound care including debridement of callus and necrotic tissue, wound cleansing, and relief of pressure on the ulcer. Consultation with a surgeon with experience in diabetic foot infection is important for cases of severe infections and most cases of moderate infections. Prompt surgical debridement is critical for cure of infections complicated by abscess, extensive bone or joint involvement, crepitus, necrosis, gangrene or necrotizing fasciitis and is important for source control in patients with severe sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Wound management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The microbiology of diabetic foot wounds varies with the severity and extent of involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55551\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55551 \">table 1</a>). Superficial infections are likely due to aerobic gram-positive cocci whereas deep, chronically infected, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> previously treated ulcers are more likely to be polymicrobial. Anaerobic organisms may also be involved in wounds with extensive local inflammation, necrosis, or gangrene. When there is concern for multidrug-resistant organisms or in cases of moderate or severe infection (including deep infections and osteomyelitis), aerobic and anaerobic cultures of deep tissue or bone biopsies should be obtained at the time of debridement. Organisms cultured from superficial swabs are not reliable for predicting the pathogens responsible for deeper infection. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H906271\" class=\"local\">'Obtaining samples for culture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Empiric antibiotic therapy should be selected based upon the severity of infection and the likelihood of involvement of resistant organisms:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with mild infections, we suggest an empiric antimicrobial regimen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69671\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69671 \">table 2</a>) with activity against skin flora including streptococci and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (including methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> [MRSA] if risk factors are present) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Mild infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with deep ulcers, we suggest an empiric antimicrobial regimen with activity against streptococci, <em>S. aureus</em> (and MRSA if risk factors are present), aerobic gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Oral antibiotics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69671\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69671 \">table 2</a>) may be appropriate for ulcers that extend to the fascia, whereas parenteral regimens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82495\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82495 \">table 3</a>) should be used for deeper infections. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Moderate infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with limb-threatening diabetic foot infections or evidence of systemic toxicity, we suggest treatment with a broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotic regimen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82495\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82495 \">table 3</a>) with activity against streptococci, MRSA, aerobic gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Severe infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antimicrobial therapy should be tailored to culture and susceptibility results when available, and a switch to an oral from parenteral regimen is reasonable following clinical improvement. Antibiotics need not be administered for the entire duration that the wound remains open. Close follow-up is important to ensure continued improvement and to evaluate the need for modification of antimicrobial therapy, further imaging, or additional surgical intervention. (See <a href=\"#H48099075\" class=\"local\">'Targeted therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H48099278\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients with osteomyelitis of the foot benefit from surgical resection. However, in certain cases, limited surgical debridement combined with prolonged antibiotic therapy may be appropriate. The duration of antibiotic therapy of osteomyelitis depends on the extent of residual affected tissue. (See <a href=\"#H906110\" class=\"local\">'Osteomyelitis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Caputo GM, Cavanagh PR, Ulbrecht JS, et al.
