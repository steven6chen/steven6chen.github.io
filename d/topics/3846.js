Enteroviruses are also not distinguished from rhinoviruses in commercial multiplex respiratory virus PCR assays due to sequence homology in the 5'-NCR. When serotype identification is required, specimens should be submitted to a reference laboratory where an isolate can be amplified in cell culture and identified at the serotype level with the use of special PCR primers or genomic sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-clinical-features-laboratory-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/98-100\" class=\"abstract_t\">98-100</a>].

In a trial of 61 neonates with suspected enterovirus disease who were randomly assigned to seven days of pleconaril or placebo, there was a trend toward more rapid viral clearance and lower overall mortality among pleconaril-treated infants (23 versus 44 percent with placebo) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-clinical-features-laboratory-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. Limitations of this study included early termination related to slow enrollment and allowance of concomitant use of IVIG at the discretion of the clinician, both of which may have attenuated the apparent efficacy of pleconaril. Other clinical trials with pleconaril include two combined studies of approximately 200 patients with enterovirus meningitis who were randomly assigned to pleconaril or placebo; patients in the treatment group had only a modest benefit (shorter duration of headache by one to two days among participants with more severe symptoms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-clinical-features-laboratory-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3549546259\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2549950644\"><span class=\"h2\">General measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simple hygienic measures, such as hand washing, are important to prevent the spread of enteroviruses and parechoviruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-clinical-features-laboratory-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>].

Most infections caused by the non-polio enteroviruses are asymptomatic or result in an undifferentiated febrile illness. Other clinical manifestations of infection include exanthems and enanthems, central nervous system (CNS) involvement, paralysis, ocular infection, pleurodynia, and myopericarditis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features of enterovirus infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Enteroviruses cause a variety of exanthema, which are sometimes associated with enanthems. Hand, foot, and mouth syndrome, due mostly to the group A coxsackieviruses and enterovirus A71, is characterized by oral vesicles on the buccal mucosa and tongue, and small tender lesions on the hands, feet, and other areas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81027\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81027 \">picture 1A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52800\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52800 \">picture 1B</a>). Herpangina is a vesicular enanthem of the tonsillar fauces and soft palate caused by several different enterovirus serotypes. Maculopapular, petechial and purpuric, and urticarial eruptions have also been described. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Exanthema and enanthems'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-and-herpangina\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hand, foot, and mouth disease and herpangina&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Aseptic meningitis is the most common manifestation of enteroviral CNS disease. Among infants, aseptic meningitis is most frequently due to group B coxsackieviruses and echoviruses. Encephalitis occurs less frequently. Certain enteroviruses (ie, polioviruses, enterovirus D68, enterovirus A71) can cause acute paresis of cranial and spinal nerves. Ocular infections have been attributed to enterovirus D70 and coxsackie A24. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Central nervous system infections'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Ocular infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pleurodynia is an acute illness characterized by fever and paroxysmal spasms of the chest and abdominal muscles. Cardiac involvement of enterovirus infection typically occurs in the form of myopericarditis. The group B coxsackieviruses are the most important cause of pleurodynia and myopericarditis. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Pleurodynia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Myopericarditis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The risks of pregnancy complication are greatest when infection occurs near term. Neonates are uniquely susceptible to enterovirus infection and may develop myocarditis or fulminant hepatitis following perinatal exposure. In individuals with B lymphocyte dysfunction, enteroviruses can cause persistent disseminated infection. (See <a href=\"#H2064443426\" class=\"local\">'Infections in special populations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parechoviruses are associated with a spectrum of disease similar to the echoviruses (ie, febrile syndromes, respiratory tract infections, exanthema, viral meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, and serious neonatal infections). Serotypes 1 and 3 are most commonly causes of parechovirus infection. (See <a href=\"#H2146316573\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features of parechovirus infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory diagnosis is warranted when identification of the causative organism has management implications, as for some CNS infections, myopericarditis, neonatal infection, and infections in immunocompromised patients, or when there are public health implications. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is typically used for enterovirus or parechovirus detection. Cell culture-based methods are useful when isolate serotyping is important. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most enterovirus infections are self-limited and do not require specific therapy apart from symptomatic and supportive care. For severe enterovirus infections, we suggest not routinely using intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, in life-threatening infections, such as fulminant neonatal infection, severe myocarditis, chronic infection in B-cell immunodeficient patients, and disseminated infections in patients with hematologic malignancies, it is reasonable to administer IVIG given the high potential for mortality, despite the lack of clear efficacy. In such patients, it is also reasonable to try to access an investigational antiviral drug under a treatment investigational new drug application. (See <a href=\"#H1188943006\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hand washing is important to prevent the spread of infection. Pregnant women near term should be advised to avoid contact with individuals suspected of having an enteroviral illness, if possible. (See <a href=\"#H3549546259\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effective vaccines against non-polio enteroviruses are not yet clinically available outside of China. Several inactivated genotype C4 enterovirus A71 vaccines appear effective and are licensed in China, although the efficacy of these vaccines in other parts of the world, where other genotypes predominate, is unknown.
