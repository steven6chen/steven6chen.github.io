Once life-threatening injuries are addressed, the goals of initial assessment include recognition and characterization of the hyphema and identification of associated orbital and ocular injuries. Although discussed separately, the assessment and management are performed jointly in practice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74146\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74146 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>If an orbital compartment syndrome or open globe is suspected, then emergent consultation with an ophthalmologist is critical to help preserve vision. In addition, optimal outcome following a hyphema depends upon early ophthalmologic intervention focused on prevention of rebleeding and avoidance of intraocular hypertension. In most instances, patients recover with vision intact. Vision loss is more likely in patients with large hyphemas, sickle hemoglobinopathies, or bleeding dyscrasias. </p><p>This review covers the initial and definitive management of traumatic hyphemas. Clinical features and diagnosis of traumatic hyphemas are discussed separately.
