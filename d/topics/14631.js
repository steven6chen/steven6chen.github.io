As therapy for these disorders improves and life expectancy of patients with PIDs increases, the prevalence of pulmonary complications is likely to increase in parallel. Consequently, knowledge of the detection and management of pulmonary disorders related to PIDs is critical for optimal management.</p><p>This topic will review the pulmonary findings that should raise suspicion of an underlying immune disorder, as well as the various pulmonary conditions that are seen in specific immunodeficiency disorders. Monitoring patients with PIDs for the development of pulmonary problems is also discussed. The evaluation of secondary immunodeficiency (eg, due to underlying diabetes, hemoglobinopathies, malignancy, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection, drug-induced immunosuppression) and an overview of the medical management of patients with immunodeficiency are found separately.

Pulmonary disease may be the initial manifestation of a PID, and certain clinical and radiographic findings, such as specific types of pulmonary infections and structural lung abnormalities, should prompt an immunologic evaluation for an underlying PID, regardless of patient age. The laboratory tests used to evaluate the immune system are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory evaluation of the immune system&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7222648\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections that are recurrent, recalcitrant to usual therapy, or due to opportunistic or unusual pathogens are suggestive of a possible underlying PID.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7222655\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrent infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the general population, recurrent pneumonias (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;2/lifetime)</span> are unusual. The association of pneumonia with recurrent sinus infections is also a clue that a PID may be present. Recurrent pneumonias in a specific lobe are suggestive of structural abnormalities, such as aberrant lung development, neoplasm, or the presence of a foreign body. Pneumonias confined to dependent lobes may indicate recurrent aspiration due to gastroesophageal reflux disease or swallowing abnormalities. In contrast, pneumonias in varying locations of the lung, particularly with interim clearing between episodes, are more indicative of underlying immune dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. The presence of unusual complications of pneumonia, such as pneumatoceles or cavitary lesions, is also concerning for immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>In addition to immunodeficiency, one should take a careful history to exclude other diseases that can lead to recurrent pneumonias. For example, recurrent sinopulmonary infections in the setting of situs inversus or infertility should raise the possibility of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), although PCD can occur without situs inversus or infertility. In males, infertility and recurrent infection can also occur in the setting of cystic fibrosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with recurrent infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-recurrent-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with recurrent infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7222662\"><span class=\"h3\">Recalcitrant infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonias respond to outpatient treatment with oral antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The need for protracted courses of antibiotics for resolution of pneumonia or the presence of complicated pneumonia (eg, multilobar opacities, empyema, lung abscess) requiring inpatient hospitalization or surgical intervention should raise the possibility of a PID.

In such patients, the only clue to underlying PID is the increased frequency or severity of sinopulmonary infections caused by common organisms, such as <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, or <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-antibody-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific antibody deficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=igg-subclass-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgG subclass deficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selective-iga-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selective IgA deficiency: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, patients with combined immunodeficiencies or with impaired phagocyte function are at increased risk of infection with opportunistic or unusual pathogens. Pneumonia caused by <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em>, <em>Pseudomonas</em>, <em>Burkholderia</em>, <em>Aspergillus</em>, or cytomegalovirus (CMV) is rare among individuals with normal immune function who have not been recently hospitalized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. Identification of these <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other unusual organisms should heighten suspicion for an underlying PID, such as disorders of primary phagocytic function (eg, chronic granulomatous disease [CGD]), or combined immunodeficiencies (eg, severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID]). The other clinical manifestations and evaluation of these infections are discussed separately.

In addition, nontuberculous mycobacterial infection has been described in patients with defective regulation of nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-kappa-B) (NF-kappa-B essential modifier [NEMO] or I-kappa-B alpha [NFKBIA]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>].

Obstructive lung disease may be detected with the use of routine spirometry, which demonstrates a decreased ratio of the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) to the forced vital capacity (FVC). A mixed obstructive-restrictive pattern may be seen in these patients and requires measurement of lung volumes for characterization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1322639\"><span class=\"h4\">Bronchiectasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of bronchiectasis, the presence of dilated and thickened airways, is a common pathologic response to repeated pyogenic infections <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> airways inflammation. PIDs are often implicated in the development of bronchiectasis, although other processes (eg, cystic fibrosis, ciliary dysfunction, recurrent aspiration, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and scarring from prior infections) are in the differential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/9,28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,28-31</a>]. Similar to recurrent pneumonia, bronchiectasis limited to dependent lung regions or a localized area of the lung should raise suspicion for a cause other than PID, such as recurrent aspiration pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Bronchiectasis can develop as a consequence of any PID that predisposes to recurrent, pyogenic infection of the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. Patients with primary antibody deficiencies (eg, X-linked agammaglobulinemia [XLA], CVID), certain combined immunodeficiencies (eg, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b [STAT5b] deficiency, activating mutations of phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta [PI3KD] syndrome [APDS]), and disorders of phagocyte dysfunction (eg, CGD) are particularly susceptible to bronchiectasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of bronchiectasis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Early forms of bronchiectasis may be reversible while more advanced forms (eg, saccular bronchiectasis) result in irreversible impairment. Chronic productive cough and dyspnea are common, particularly during infectious episodes, although many patients with bronchiectasis are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Obstructive impairment (ie, reduced or normal FVC, low forced expiratory volume (FEV<sub>1</sub>), and low FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC)</span> is the most frequent finding, but a very low FVC can also be seen in advanced disease, when much of the lung has been destroyed.

High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest is the gold standard for the diagnosis of bronchiectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/28,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,37,38</a>]. Typical HRCT findings of bronchiectasis include parallel (tram) lines and dilated bronchi that are usually 1.5 times wider in diameter than the accompanying pulmonary artery branch. This cross-sectional configuration resembles a signet ring, thus the name &quot;signet ring sign.&quot; Airways affected by bronchiectasis may contain mucopurulent plugs or debris accompanied by postobstructive air trapping. When small airways are affected, peripheral, irregular, short (2 to 4 mm) linear branching markings are noted and are called &quot;tree-in-bud pattern&quot; opacities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52831\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52831 \">image 1</a>).

BO may develop after inhalation of toxic fumes, pulmonary infection (eg, Mycoplasma, Legionella) in the context of rheumatologic disease, or after bone <span class=\"nowrap\">marrow/hematopoietic</span> stem cell or <span class=\"nowrap\">lung/heart-lung</span> transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. BO is associated with nonspecific clinical complaints, such as insidious cough and dyspnea.</p><p>In constrictive bronchiolitis, tests of lung function may be normal or show obstructive changes with air trapping. Diffusing capacity (DLCO) is usually reduced, particularly as the disease progresses. Resting hypoxemia is frequently present. The combination of fixed, rather than reversible, obstructive airways disease on spirometry, plus a gas transfer defect manifest by a low DLCO or hypoxemia on exertion, is suggestive of BO. Other clues include the absence of radiographic evidence of bronchiectasis, or a severity of airflow obstruction that seems out of proportion to the degree of bronchiectasis. BO has been reported in patients with SCID, AT, and CVID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p>Chest radiograph is insensitive for the diagnosis of BO, although bronchial wall thickening or hyperinflation may be noted. HRCT may be normal or can show nonspecific ground-glass opacities, centrilobular nodularity, air trapping, or bronchial wall thickening (eg, centrilobular nodules and V- or Y-shaped branching linear opacities) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/15,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,42</a>]. Obtaining inspiratory and expiratory HRCT images may help identify air trapping (mosaic or diffuse), but the absence of air trapping does not exclude the diagnosis.

In patients with AT, symptoms of ILD are usually nonspecific, including cough, dyspnea, and fever. Early identification of AT-related ILD and assessment of therapeutic response is often limited by reluctance to perform radiographic studies out of concern for radiation sensitivity.

Focal scarring and honeycomb formation may follow lung infection.</p><p>Given the broad spectrum of pathogens implicated in CGD, effort should be made to identify a causative organism prior to initiating treatment. In particular, special emphasis should be placed on obtaining a thorough exposure history in patients who present acutely with fever, dyspnea, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, as acute, fulminant, mulch-related pneumonitis has been observed and constitutes a medical emergency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/156,157\" class=\"abstract_t\">156,157</a>].

Autosomal dominant hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome is due to mutations in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and is additionally associated with pneumatocele formation, skeletal disease (eg, fractures, scoliosis), and vascular abnormalities (eg, cerebral aneurysms, thrombotic events) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/159-161\" class=\"abstract_t\">159-161</a>].
