Cell adhesion molecules represent a heterogeneous group of transmembrane molecules expressed on numerous cell types, including endothelial cells and leukocytes. Cell adhesion molecules promote the transmigration of leukocytes across the endothelial cell. The particular molecule targeted by natalizumab is alpha-4 integrin, which is expressed on all circulating leukocytes except neutrophils.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5930522\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Natalizumab</a> is indicated for inducing and maintaining clinical response and remission in adult patients with Crohn disease.

It should not be used in patients who may have impaired immunity, are taking immunosuppressants, or are taking TNF inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. We suggest stopping glucocorticoids within a few months of initiation of natalizumab.

Leukocyte and neutrophil counts should be within or close to the normal range prior to starting therapy. </p><p>Due to serious adverse events, the drug is available only through a prescribing program (CD-TOUCH Prescribing Program, Biogen Idec, Weston, MA). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Adverse events'</a> below.)</p><p>Information on the CD-TOUCH Prescribing Program can be obtained from Biogen Idec <span class=\"nowrap\">(https://medinfo</span>.biogenidec.<span class=\"nowrap\">com/medinfo</span> or 1-800-456-2255).</p><p>The approval of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vedolizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vedolizumab</a> for ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease by the US Food and Drug Administration in May 2014 has altered the likely use for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a> in inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As a selective cell adhesion molecule antagonist that offers the availability of a different mechanism from anti-TNFs without the risk to date of PML, vedolizumab would be the first-line use in place of natalizumab in this class of medications. However, natalizumab remains a useful alternative, particularly in JC virus antibody negative patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5930745\"><span class=\"h1\">ADMINISTRATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Natalizumab</a> is given as an intravenous infusion and must be administered at an infusion center that is registered with the TOUCH Prescribing Program. Typically, 300 mg are given at weeks 0, 4, and 8, and then given every four weeks for maintenance. If a patient has had no response by week 12, the drug is discontinued. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Natalizumab</a> was shown to be superior to placebo in a meta-analysis that included five trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients treated with natalizumab were less likely to fail to achieve remission than patients treated with placebo (RR 0.88). </p><p>Two of the trials included in the meta-analysis showed the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest trial, Efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Natalizumab</a> as Active Crohn's Therapy (ENACT-1) trial, included a total of 905 patients with active Crohn disease who were randomly assigned to natalizumab (300 mg) or placebo at weeks 0, 4, and 8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Response, defined by a decrease in the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-crohns-disease-activity-index-cdai-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) of at least 70 points at week 10, was similar to placebo (56 versus 49 percent). A post-hoc analysis of the results in patients with elevated CRP at baseline showed efficacy for natalizumab compared with placebo.<br/><br/>The 339 responders to natalizumab were enrolled in a follow-up trial (ENACT-2) in which they were randomly reassigned to receive 300 mg of natalizumab or placebo every four weeks through week 56 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients receiving natalizumab had significantly higher rates of sustained response (61 versus 28 percent) and remission (44 versus 26 percent) through week 36, as well as higher discontinuation rates of glucocorticoids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second trial, Efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Natalizumab</a> in Crohn&rsquo;s Disease Response and Remission (ENCORE) trial, included 509 patients with moderately to severely active Crohn disease and active inflammation (CRP &gt;2.87 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The patients were randomly assigned to natalizumab (300 mg) or placebo at weeks 0, 4, and 8. The primary end point was induction of a response, defined as a &ge;70 point reduction in the CDAI at week eight and sustained through week 12. A response was observed significantly more often in patients assigned to natalizumab (48 versus 32 percent). In addition, sustained remission (CDAI &lt;150) was observed significantly more often with natalizumab (26 versus 16 percent). The frequency and types of adverse events were similar between treatment groups.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE EVENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serious adverse events occurred at a similar rate to the placebo arm in two controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. However, in an open-label extension, one patient with Crohn disease on monotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a> died from JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Two other case reports described an association between natalizumab and PML in patients with multiple sclerosis treated with natalizumab and interferon beta-1a (Avonex) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Latent JC virus infection and viral shedding are common in immunosuppressed patients with Crohn disease, but risk factors of JC-related disease are unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As a result, marketing of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a> was suspended in February 2005 but was subsequently resumed for multiple sclerosis. At least 270 additional cases of PML have occurred in patients with multiple sclerosis since the drug was reintroduced, with a 20 percent mortality rate and a high degree of disability among survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-for-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natalizumab for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Risk of PML'</a>.)</p><p>The risk of PML is associated with duration of treatment, with no increased risk observed in the initial year of therapy. Prior immune suppressant medication use appears to increase the risk as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Because of the risk of PML, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a> is available for the treatment of Crohn disease only through a special restricted distribution program called the CD-TOUCH Prescribing Program. Natalizumab is not approved for use in Crohn disease in Europe. (See <a href=\"#H5930522\" class=\"local\">'Indications and contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p>A test for JC virus antibody is commercially available and may be a reliable marker for those at higher risk of developing PML. Use of the JC virus antibody assay has been advocated to stratify the risk of PML. For those who are JC virus antibody negative, the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a> is likely associated with minimal risk of developing PML. As the rate of acquisition of JC virus may be as much as 1 percent annually, the frequency of JC virus antibody testing is uncertain but at least once a year would be advisable for those being administered natalizumab.</p><p>Severe cholestatic liver injury has also been reported, prompting the manufacturer to issue a warning in February 2008. Affected patients developed marked elevation in serum aminotransferases and bilirubin as soon as six days after the first dose. Thus, liver biochemical tests should be monitored and the drug discontinued in patients with evidence of liver injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1601599522\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
