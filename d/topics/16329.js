The presenting symptoms and signs of LAM vary depending upon the organs affected by the disease. Most commonly, patients have the signs and symptoms of lung disease (see <a href=\"#H856313075\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary'</a> below) but can also present with symptomatology arising from disease in extrapulmonary sites, especially renal angiomyolipomas and the lymphatic vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>] (see <a href=\"#H2235272076\" class=\"local\">'Non pulmonary'</a> below). Neurocutaneous findings and disease manifestations that are typical of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC; eg, angiofibromas, Shagreen patches, cortical tubers, seizures, cognitive impairment, etc) are absent in sporadic LAM. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3008387008\"><span class=\"h2\">General</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with LAM are mostly premenopausal (approximately two-thirds in most trials and registries) women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. While the average age at presentation is typically between the mid-thirties and mid-forties, the range extends from preadolescence to elderly (&gt;80 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/4,7-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7-15</a>]. Prepubertal LAM is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. It has been postulated that the increase in mean presentation age over the past decade or so may be due to increased awareness, an increased index of suspicion for LAM, and the increasing detection of cysts by computed tomography (CT) in patients under evaluation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or other chronic pulmonary disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. LAM occurs in men, but is rare, thus far exclusively in men with TSC, and almost always asymptomatic.

As dyspnea is nonspecific and LAM is rare, women are often labeled with a diagnosis of asthma, emphysema, or COPD before LAM is suspected. Furthermore, up to one-third of women with LAM also have reversible airflow obstruction, which can add to confusion with other obstructive lung diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/32,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,37,38</a>]. </p><p>Pneumothorax is the presenting complaint in one-third of patients, and occurs during the course of the disease in up to two-thirds of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/7,18,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,18,39,40</a>]. Recurrences are frequent. In one observational study, in those with recurrent pneumothorax, the mean number of pneumothoraces was four (ipsilateral, contralateral, or bilateral) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

It has been suggested that women who present with pneumothorax have a more benign course than those who present with dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], although ascertainment earlier in the course of disease likely confounds interpretation of this observation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Pleural effusions are most commonly due to chylothorax, occurring in 10 to 30 percent of women with LAM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/18,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,42</a>]. One systematic review of 94 studies reported that chylous effusions were typically unilateral (76 percent) and right-sided, although bilateral effusions can also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Biochemical parameters may reveal an exudative effusion with the typical features of chyle (eg, high triglyceride, cholesterol, chylomicrons). Chylothorax volume varies and can be quite stable over time. Pleural chyle may arise from sources in the abdomen; pumped into the thorax by the bellows action of the chest, but more often occurs in the absence of chylous accumulation in the peritoneum (&lt;5 percent) or elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of chylothorax&quot;, section on 'Pleural fluid analysis'</a>.)</p><p>Lymphatic pulmonary congestion due to reflux of chyle from the axial lymphatics into the pulmonary lymphatic circuit can result in worsening shortness of breath associated with chyloptysis or chylous pleural effusion. Chest radiographs and computed tomographic studies may reveal ground glass or an interstitial pulmonary edema pattern with septal thickening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. Further details regarding the lymphatic manifestations of LAM are provided separately. (See <a href=\"#H2572532093\" class=\"local\">'Lymphatic manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>Resting pulmonary hypertension (PH) is uncommon (&lt;7 percent) in LAM, but exercise-induced increases in pulmonary pressures occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. In a series of 120 patients with LAM, 7 percent had resting PH on echocardiography, and approximately 50 percent experienced a decline in oxygen saturation with exertion, which correlated with a rise in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In a separate report, intrapulmonary arteriovenous shunts were demonstrated by contrast echocardiography in a small number of patients with LAM who developed hypoxemia and increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure during exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Another retrospective study of 20 women with LAM who had PH by right heart catheterization found that when present, PH was typically mild (mean PAP 32 mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

While renal AMLs may be asymptomatic (especially small lesions), patients with lesions larger than 4 cm, especially those that contain aneurysms, may present with the features of hemorrhage (abdominal pain and a mass). Rarely, AMLs may grow to enormous size prior to clinical detection in patients with sporadic LAM, but do not typically affect renal function in the absence of TSC. If AMLs are large, bilateral, or multiple, then TSC should be suspected (80 to 100 percent of patients with TSC have AMLs). (See <a href=\"#H2453970428\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal imaging'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex#H4135678\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex&quot;, section on 'Angiomyolipomas'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-angiomyolipomas#H5623321\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal angiomyolipomas&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Small AMLs may be encountered incidentally in abdominal CT imaging done for another reason.

In most cases, the decision to pursue HRCT is triggered by recurrent pneumothorax, chylothorax, or relentlessly progressive dyspnea on exertion, although an increasing proportion of women are presenting with evidence of characteristic thin walled, diffusely distributed pulmonary cysts on chest or abdominal CT performed for a different indication. Noncontrast abdominopelvic CT is indicated to look for the presence of angiomyolipomas if cysts are found on chest CT or the patient has abdominal or pelvic symptoms or signs that warrant dedicated abdominal imaging (eg, sudden flank pain).

These include a normal radiograph (early in the course of the disease), reticular or nodular opacities (from the compression of lung tissue by dilated cystic airspaces), hyperinflation (33 to 62 percent of patients), emphysematous-like changes, pleural effusion (often due to a chylothorax), pneumothorax, or lymphadenopathy.

Cysts characteristic of LAM are thin walled, diffuse, round, well-defined, bilateral, and without lobar predominance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F111638\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111638 \">image 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/55,57,62,63,92,95,97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,57,62,63,92,95,97,98</a>]. They vary in size ranging from 2 to 40 mm in diameter and typically have walls ranging from 0.1 to 2 mm in thickness. The cysts are typically devoid of internal structures (eg, centrilobular vessels or septae) or consistent relationships with adjacent vessels, airways, or interlobular septae.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although cystic change in the lung parenchyma progresses over time, no natural history studies have clearly delineated when cysts begin to develop or their rate of progression. Similarly, because isolated cysts are occasionally found in healthy nonsmoking subjects, it is important to set a threshold for the number of cysts in any one individual that is considered to be abnormal. While some experts have suggested a cut-off of &gt;3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>], we and other experts usually select a higher cut-off &gt;10 cysts, such that LAM should be highly suspected in women with more than 10 typical cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The likelihood of LAM may be lower in those with fewer cysts (eg, &gt;2 and &le;10), but LAM is still theoretically possible in such cases. While the 10 cyst cut-off is arbitrary and needs to be validated in formal studies, it was chosen in part to discourage lung biopsy in asymptomatic patients with very few cysts and normal lung physiology. The approach to biopsy in those with atypical cysts is discussed below.

Whether present or not, most experts obtain additional abdominal-pelvic imaging to determine the presence and extent of AML involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], most commonly a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrasound (USG) may be a reasonable alternative but is less sensitive and less accurate, especially for small lesions. The rationale for this approach is that the prevalence of renal AMLs is high in sporadic LAM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and, when present, AMLs can provide the basis for a clinical nonpathologic diagnosis of LAM, thereby obviating the need for biopsy. Less commonly, evidence of lymphatic involvement may be found on CT, which may support a diagnosis of LAM (eg, lymphangioleiomyomas) or provide the clinician with a less invasive alternative to lung biopsy (eg, cytological evaluation of a lymph node aspirate or chylous fluid). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Renal AMLs</strong> &ndash; Renal AMLs occur in approximately one-third of women with sporadic LAM, which is much less frequent than in those with TSC-LAM (&gt;80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/7,53,105,106\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,53,105,106</a>]. Most renal AMLS can be readily identified and diagnosed radiographically, typically by the presence of fat within a renal tumor on noncontrast-enhanced CT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F111640\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111640 \">image 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F111641\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111641 \">image 8</a>). Fat-free or fat-poor AMLs can also occur, and must be distinguished renal cell carcinomas, oncocytomas, or other more aggressive neoplasms, which can rarely complicate TSC and sporadic LAM. MRI can be helpful in some of these cases because it is more sensitive than CT for detecting fat density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Imaging findings must be carefully interpreted because hemorrhage into an AML can produce a complex renal mass that may be confused with a renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and small amounts of fat can be rarely found in RCCs. Knowledge of a pre-existing AML and the presence of fat attenuation may help in the differentiation of these entities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Ultrasound is typically less sensitive than CT for detection of small lesions and MRI is useful for assessing tissue composition (fat, vessel, etc) and aneurysmal content, which is helpful in assessing the risk of hemorrhage.

Similar results were obtained in other VEGF-D studies, although differences between laboratories in the normative ranges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>] and the use of normal volunteers instead of cystic lung disease controls limits direct comparisons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/113-115\" class=\"abstract_t\">113-115</a>]. Importantly, a negative VEGF-D level (&lt;800 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> should not be used to exclude the diagnosis of LAM and the test has only been validated in women with cystic change that is compatible with LAM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. VEGF-D would not likely be useful for population screening in the absence of documented cystic change on CT, since even a near perfect specificity of 99.9 percent would lead to too many false positives. </p><p>The optimal approach in those with a VEGF-D between 600 and &lt;799 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> is less certain. Although a cut-off &ge;600 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> has a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 84 and 98 percent, respectively, false positives are highly undesirable, especially when considering initiating long-term or lifetime exposure to therapies such as mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors that have significant side effects. Thus, we and other experts use a cut-off of &ge;800 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> and consider VEGF-D &ge;600 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> to be meaningful only in lower risk situations, such as for patients who are not interested in therapies or interventions.

However, surgical lung biopsy is not always necessary and a confident diagnosis can often be achieved less invasively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F111016\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef111016 \">algorithm 1</a>). Thus, there has been a paradigm shift in practice that involves the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtaining a clinically confident diagnosis through the least invasive means possible using an approach that integrates clinical, radiological, and laboratory data. Observational data suggest that utilizing such strategies reduces the need for biopsy by as much as 60 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2739820490\" class=\"local\">'Additional resources'</a> below.)</p><p>We base our approach to the diagnosis of LAM on the following factors: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mode</strong> <strong>of presentation</strong> &ndash; The approach to a pathological diagnosis of LAM varies based on presentation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Typical presentations</strong> &ndash; Most experts agree on what constitutes typical presentations that meet criteria for a clinically confident diagnosis (eg, typical cysts plus tuberous sclerosis complex [TSC]). For patients with typical cysts who do not meet criteria for a clinically confident diagnosis, the presence of tissue or fluid that is more readily accessible (eg, effusion that can be tapped or lymph node accessible by endobronchial ultrasonography) presents diagnostic opportunities that are less invasive than lung biopsy. Similarly, a lung biopsy performed at the time of therapeutic pleurodesis for recurrent pneumothorax carries limited additional risk compared with a separate biopsy procedure. (See <a href=\"#H2491660505\" class=\"local\">'Characteristic cysts with supportive features'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3926593331\" class=\"local\">'Characteristic cysts alone on computed tomography'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Atypical presentations</strong> &ndash; For those with atypical presentations, there are no clear guidelines and the approach should be individualized.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Assessment of risk and benefit</strong> &ndash; Decisions regarding the importance of obtaining a pathological diagnosis are based upon assessments of risks and benefits. As examples, observation may be appropriate in patients with only a few cysts and normal lung function, as well as in post-menopausal patients with mild disease (ie, when disease progression is known to be slower). In addition, the value of establishing a definitive diagnosis by biopsy in patients with severe end-stage lung disease approaching lung transplantation is questionable. (See <a href=\"#H243469400\" class=\"local\">'Choosing transbronchial or surgical lung biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The values and preferences of the patient</strong> &ndash; Some patients place a high value on diagnostic certainty and are willing to accept the risk associated with an invasive procedure while others prefer to avoid them. Thus, a risk-benefit discussion is critical so that the decision to pursue biopsy can be a shared one between the patient and the clinician. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=a-patient-centered-view-of-the-clinician-patient-relationship\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;A patient-centered view of the clinician-patient relationship&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discussing-goals-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discussing goals of care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=informed-procedural-consent\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Informed procedural consent&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>We propose the algorithmic diagnostic strategy outlined in the sections below acknowledging that it should be tailored for each individual. This strategy is consistent with that outlined by the American Thoracic Society, but differs slightly from that of the European Respiratory Society, which was published at a time when data on the value of vascular endothelial growth factor-D were not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/57,77,118\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,77,118</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2491660505\"><span class=\"h2\">Characteristic cysts with supportive features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected LAM, a surgical biopsy may be avoided in select populations who have characteristic cysts on computed tomography (CT) of the chest (see <a href=\"#H1168752151\" class=\"local\">'Chest computed tomography'</a> above) and one or more of the features listed in the sections below. A nonpathologic diagnosis may be reached with high certainty (ie, clinically confident diagnosis) in most of these populations. However, in a small proportion, a more definitive diagnosis may be needed and can be obtained cytologically using needle aspiration (ie, less invasive) techniques or pathologically on tissue biopsy of lung or lymph nodes. Reasons that may mandate a more aggressive invasive approach include those who have atypical presentations (especially when considering interventions entailing risk such as mTOR inhibitor therapy), suspicion for an alternate diagnosis, and patient preferences for certainty. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2063826615\"><span class=\"h3\">Tuberous sclerosis complex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with TSC and cysts characteristic of LAM on CT do not need to undergo diagnostic lung biopsy due to the high prevalence of LAM and the low likelihood that cysts in TSC are due to a non-LAM-related condition. Patients with sporadic LAM do not have stigmata of TSC (other than angiomyolipomas). However, the features of TSC can be subtle leading to a missed diagnosis. Thus, a thorough history and examination should be performed in patients with suspected sporadic LAM to look for manifestations of TSC (eg, subungual fibromas, facial angiofibromas, hypomelanotic macules, confetti lesions, Shagreen patches, seizures, autism, cognitive impairment). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberous sclerosis complex: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Genetic testing for mutations in the TSC genes, <em>TSC1 </em>and<em> TSC2</em>, is generally not justified for ruling out tuberous sclerosis in patients who present with apparent sporadic LAM.

Most experts make a clinical diagnosis of LAM using these criteria that is sufficient to provide an indication for long-term use of mTOR inhibitors. The rationale for avoiding biopsy in this group is based upon the high prevalence of AMLs in women with sporadic LAM, the rarity of AMLs in other cystic lung diseases that mimic LAM, and the risks of biopsy. </p><p>However, the clinician should be aware that sporadic AMLs may rarely occur in patients who have cystic lung disease due to other etiologies (eg, Birt-Hogg-Dub&eacute; syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/119-121\" class=\"abstract_t\">119-121</a>].

Thus, a clinically confident diagnosis of LAM can be made in this population, which is sufficient to justify proceeding with mTOR inhibitor therapy, when indicated. The rationale for this approach is based upon observational studies that demonstrated the ability of elevated serum VEGF-D to distinguish LAM from other cystic lung diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/109,116\" class=\"abstract_t\">109,116</a>], the details of which are discussed above.

Since serum VEGF-D may be reflective of lymphatic involvement in LAM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>] and LAM cell clusters (LCCs) may be found on cytology, we also generally measure VEGF-D levels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> resample chylous fluid for cytologic analysis, especially when considering mTOR therapy. (See <a href=\"#H801427549\" class=\"local\">'Vascular endothelial growth factor-D'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1317599940\" class=\"local\">'Cytology'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with characteristic cysts and <strong>suspected</strong> chyle, a sample should be obtained to look for the characteristic biochemical findings of chyle (ie, elevated triglycerides and cholesterol, chylomicrons) and cytologic LCCs, provided sample acquisition is safe and feasible (eg, tiny accumulations, particularly in the pericardial space, may not be suitable). &#160;</p><p/><p>Although the diagnostic yield of cytologic analysis of chylous fluids tends to be low in our experience, when LAM cells are identified pathologically, the diagnosis is certain. Thus thoracentesis and cytology can be useful in distinguishing the etiology of chylous effusion in the rare cases where cystic lung diseases that mimic LAM and chylothorax can coexist (eg, lymphoma). Elevated levels of serum VEGF-D can also support the diagnosis.

The choice between lung or lymph node biopsy in those with a negative VEGF-D level should be individualized and depends upon number, location, and size of lymph nodes, the level of confidence of the radiologist that abdominal masses represent lymphangioleiomyomas, severity of underlying lung disease, and patient preferences. When lymph node biopsy is chosen we typically attempt to perform needle aspiration and avoid excisional biopsy since in our anecdotal experience, and that of others, the postoperative course of resective surgery can be complicated by significant and prolonged chyle leak. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3926593331\"><span class=\"h2\">Characteristic cysts alone on computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that patients with characteristic cysts on chest CT and absence of any other confirmatory features, including pathological or cytological confirmation, TSC, AML, lymphatic manifestations (lymphadenopathy, lymphangioleiomyoma, chylous accumulation) or elevated serum VEGF-D level (&gt;800 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL),</span> sometimes referred to as &quot;lone LAM,&quot; should undergo lung biopsy, when a definitive diagnosis is desired by the patient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> necessary for optimal management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. This approach is based upon data that suggest that the classic appearance of cysts on chest CT is not sufficiently diagnostic to support interventions that entail risk, such as long-term exposure to mTOR inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/118,123-125\" class=\"abstract_t\">118,123-125</a>]. While an expert thoracic radiologist can diagnose LAM based upon chest CT findings alone with a sensitivity of 87 percent and a specificity of 97 percent, the performance of pulmonary physicians was inferior to the radiologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>], and not every facility has access to an expert thoracic radiologist familiar with the imaging characteristics of LAM and other rare cystic lung diseases. Based on this rationale, and the potential for adverse effects associated with long-term exposure to mTOR inhibitors, we perform lung biopsy in this population. Choosing between transbronchial and surgical lung biopsy is discussed below.

We suggest an individualized approach using the principles outlined above, close monitoring of the disease with frequent clinical and lung function follow-up, and a low threshold to obtain tissue for cytological or pathological examination when candidacy for therapy is dependent on a definitive diagnosis and disease is progressive over time. As an example, patients with a borderline VEGF-D (eg, 600 to 799 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> and very low cyst burden (perhaps a few dozen cysts), we typically follow conservatively, by monitoring lung function annually and repeating the HRCT at one year. If stability or slow progression is documented, we extend the interval for the next HCRT to three to five years, whereas if progression is more rapid, tissue confirmation may be warranted.</p><p>Similarly, atypical presentations of other diseases that mimic LAM should be considered in the differential and an individualized approach used for diagnosis (eg, cyst and AML in Birt Hogg Dub&eacute; syndrome, cysts and chylous effusion in lymphoma).

Options include transbronchial biopsy, which has a yield of about 60 percent, and surgical lung biopsy, which has a yield approaching 100 percent.

In contrast to cysts in LAM, cysts in emphysema may contain septae or centrilobular vessels, and are often upper lobe predominant with indiscernible borders.

It is a multisystem disorder that is associated with renal cysts and masses (including angiomyolipomas in very rare circumstances), cutaneous fibrofolliculomas and trichodiscomas, and cystic lung disease that frequently presents with recurrent spontaneous pneumothoraces. Lung cysts are found in over 80 percent of BHD patients, and are usually basilar or perivascular, subpleural, and crescent-shaped or elliptical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/150,151\" class=\"abstract_t\">150,151</a>].

In addition, PLCH is strongly associated with cigarette smoking (90 to 100 percent are smokers), has no female predilection, and is associated with stellate nodular findings on CT (which are typically early manifestations of the disease). Thus, thick-walled cystic changes in a young male smoker that spares the costophrenic angles are more likely due to PLCH, while thin-walled cysts in a nonsmoking female would be more consistent with LAM. The finding of more than 5 percent of Langerhans cells (CD-1a positive) on bronchoalveolar lavage is diagnostic of PLCH. Although the clinical and radiographic presentation of PLCH is often sufficiently distinctive that a presumptive diagnosis can be made, a definitive diagnosis of PLCH typically requires pathological confirmation, via either a transbronchial lung biopsy or a video assisted thorascopic-guided surgical lung biopsy.

(See <a href=\"#H1009250863\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1042566090\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LAM should be suspected in a young female who presents with a spontaneous pneumothorax, unexplained dyspnea, pleural or peritoneal chyle, TSC, or a renal angiomyolipoma (AML). With increasing use of computed tomography (CT), lung cysts characteristic of the diagnosis are often discovered incidentally in asymptomatic patients. Other manifestations of LAM include pulmonary hypertension, lymphadenopathy, or lymphangioleiomyomas. (See <a href=\"#H3404243203\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When LAM is suspected, the following should be performed:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pulmonary function tests (PFTs), including spirometry with bronchodilator testing, lung volumes, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). While airflow obstruction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a reduced DLCO are typical, normal PFTS do not preclude the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H2842574710\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary function tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Noncontrast high resolution CT (HRCT) should be obtained to demonstrate pulmonary cysts characteristic of the disease. Cysts are classically multiple (&gt;10), diffuse, round, well-defined, bilateral, without lobar predominance, and thin-walled. (See <a href=\"#H1168752151\" class=\"local\">'Chest computed tomography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If characteristic cysts are found, we suggest the following be performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F111016\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef111016 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A thorough history and examination for the symptoms and signs of tuberous sclerosis complex. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberous sclerosis complex: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abdominopelvic imaging to primarily look for the presence of AMLs, but also for effusions suggestive of chyle, lymphadenopathy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lymphangioleiomyomas. (See <a href=\"#H2453970428\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Measurement of serum vascular endothelial growth factor-D (VEGF-D); level &ge;800 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> distinguishes LAM from other cystic lung diseases. This can be obtained as a send out test through the <a href=\"https://research.cchmc.org/translationalcores/ttdsl&amp;token=ylr2lM8ySS+tt2EUzFMi5vJYvqVpcylOK8KRhFeRzPS7x0XkDmKy/bwXd+mCg9e0MCLtYF7DA3vpMqmOaphYHw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=3971\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Translational Trials Laboratory at Cincinnati Children's</a>. Other serologic tests, including alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) levels, rheumatoid factor, anti-nuclear antibody, and Sj&ouml;gren related antibodies <span class=\"nowrap\">(SSA/Ro</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">SSB/La</span> antibodies), may be performed to exclude disorders that can mimic LAM. (See <a href=\"#H3296397935\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When considering a diagnosis of LAM, the ideal goal is to obtain the most definitive possible diagnosis using the least invasive strategy as is feasible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F111016\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef111016 \">algorithm 1</a>). Utilizing such strategies reduces the need for biopsy and is sufficient to support the use of mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors for treatment. Our approach is the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients who have characteristic cysts on chest CT and known TSC, AML, chylous effusions, classic CT appearance of lymphangioleiomyoma, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a VEGF-D level <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;800pg/mL,</span> a lung biopsy can be avoided and a clinically confident nonpathologic diagnosis may be made. A definitive pathologic diagnosis may occasionally be indicated in this population in patients who have atypical presentations (especially when considering interventions entailing risk such as mTOR inhibitor therapy), suspicion of an alternate diagnosis, and patient preferences for certainty. (See <a href=\"#H2491660505\" class=\"local\">'Characteristic cysts with supportive features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4160401735\" class=\"local\">'Vascular endothelial growth factor-D positive'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3123169771\" class=\"local\">'Atypical presentations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H302353881\" class=\"local\">'Clinical nonpathologic diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In most patients who have characteristic cysts on chest CT without any of the listed supporting features, we suggest a tissue biopsy be performed, if feasible. Options include lung biopsy (eg, transbronchial and surgical) or lymph node biopsy (needle aspiration or resectional). The decision to proceed with biopsy and choosing among the options should be individualized and is influenced by factors including the presenting manifestations, clinician experience, disease severity, and values of the patient. The definitive diagnosis of LAM is made by the histopathologic confirmation of lung cysts and histopathologic or cytologic identification of LAM cells in lung, lymph node, or body fluid. (See <a href=\"#H3926593331\" class=\"local\">'Characteristic cysts alone on computed tomography'</a> above and <a href=\"#H243469400\" class=\"local\">'Choosing transbronchial or surgical lung biopsy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3123873921\" class=\"local\">'Definitive pathologic diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with atypical presentations, the approach should be individualized using the minimally invasive approach, when appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H3123169771\" class=\"local\">'Atypical presentations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conditions that are in the differential diagnosis of LAM include other causes of cystic lung disease, pneumothorax, and chylothorax. (See <a href=\"#H1360774165\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sporadic LAM is a multisystem, progressive disease that requires assessment of disease extent. For those with a clinical diagnosis of LAM, an opportunity may arise during follow-up to make a definitive diagnosis from lung tissue obtained during thoracoscopic pleurodesis or from chyle that may develop the course of disease progression. (See <a href=\"#H3966208529\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of disease extent'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Kalassian KG, Doyle R, Kao P, et al.
