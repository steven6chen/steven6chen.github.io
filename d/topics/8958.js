None of the patients had adjuvant RT; 40 received adjuvant ADT and were excluded from subsequent outcome analyses.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 10-year rates of cancer-specific survival, freedom from distant metastases, and freedom from biochemical relapse were 72, 65, and 28 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On multivariate analysis, the primary factors associated with both biochemical recurrence and the development of distant metastases were a pathologic Gleason score &gt;7 and the presence of &ge;3 positive nodes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H432839926\"><span class=\"h3\">Adjuvant RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no large randomized trials assessing the role of adjuvant RT following radical prostatectomy in men with positive lymph nodes. However, retrospective data from large series suggest that this approach can improve outcomes in some individuals. </p><p>A retrospective cohort study of 1338 men with lymph node involvement who underwent radical prostatectomy at three centers between 1988 and 2010 analyzed overall survival for those whose initial management was observation (n = 387), ADT (n = 676), or RT plus ADT (n = 325) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-regionally-localized-intermediate-high-and-very-high-risk-prostate-cancer/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. There were substantial differences in the patient populations managed with different strategies, with higher pathologic Gleason score, higher pathologic stage of the tumor, and a higher number of involved lymph nodes being more likely to receive aggressive adjuvant therapy.</p><p>The combination of ADT plus RT was associated with a significantly improved overall survival compared with observation (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.27-0.64) or ADT alone (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.32-0.66). The 10-year all-cause mortality with ADT plus RT ranged from 12 to 31 percent based upon pathologic Gleason grade, stage, margin status, and the number of positive nodes. For those managed with ADT alone, the 10-year all-cause mortality ranged from 17 to 71 percent based upon associated risk factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3567290\"><span class=\"h3\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis for men with one or more positive lymph nodes at radical prostatectomy is illustrated by a single-institution study of 1011 men treated between 1987 and 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-regionally-localized-intermediate-high-and-very-high-risk-prostate-cancer/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. Median follow-up was 17.6 years.</p><p>The rate of biochemical recurrence at 15 years was 52 percent, and the rate of clinical recurrence was 33 percent. Approximately one-half of the clinical recurrences were detected more than five years after surgery.

These procedures may have a role in older adults, and in those with substantial comorbidities and a limited life expectancy. However, prolonged local disease control is unlikely. These approaches should never be employed if definitive treatment is the therapeutic goal.

Radical prostatectomy should be limited to patients without fixation of their primary tumor.

If RT is administered as a combination of EBRT plus brachytherapy, we suggest that a short-term course (12 months) of ADT be given as well (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Whether the addition of brachytherapy to EBRT provides benefit beyond that achievable with adequate doses of EBRT (&ge;72 Gy) plus ADT is unclear. Nevertheless, we suggest using brachytherapy in conjunction with EBRT and ADT for men with localized, high-risk disease who are appropriate candidates for brachytherapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50303\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50303 \">table 5</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).

However, an overall survival advantage has not been demonstrated in this setting, and RT to the prostate only is an appropriate alternative based upon a consideration of the patient's overall situation. (See <a href=\"#H181128733\" class=\"local\">'Prostate only versus whole pelvis RT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Radical prostatectomy</strong> &ndash; For men with regionally localized intermediate-, high-, or very high-risk prostate cancer who choose radical prostatectomy as their primary therapy, we recommend that ADT not be used prior to radical prostatectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). There is no evidence that this approach improves resectability or long-term outcomes after prostatectomy. (See <a href=\"#H181131068\" class=\"local\">'Radical prostatectomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H181129801\" class=\"local\">'Neoadjuvant therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy should be reassessed for possible further treatment based upon the histopathologic results and pathologic staging. For patients with adverse histologic features (extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle involvement, positive margins, or lymph node involvement) or a persistent elevation of the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after surgery, postoperative adjuvant RT may be indicated.
