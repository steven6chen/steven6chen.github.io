Surgical biopsy should not be used as a diagnostic tool unless percutaneous palpation-guided or image-guided biopsy is not feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The types and choice of method for breast biopsy and postoperative care and follow-up, including reviewing biopsy results and the potential need for rebiopsy, are reviewed here. The clinical features and diagnosis of a breast mass and screening for breast cancer that might indicate the need for breast biopsy are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-a-palpable-breast-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of a palpable breast mass&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for breast cancer: Strategies and recommendations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of specific breast diagnoses identified through breast biopsy (eg, invasive ductal carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ) is discussed in specific topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20945288\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT EVALUATION AND PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Properly preparing patients for breast biopsy and the potential results can do much to alleviate anxiety. The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categories 4A, 4B, and 4C identify lesions as having low, moderate, and high likelihood of being associated with a malignancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F100197\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100197 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast imaging for cancer screening: Mammography and ultrasonography&quot;, section on 'The BI-RADS categories'</a>.)</p><p>Some facilities premedicate the patient with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> or other short-acting anxiolytics medications. Patients receiving more than just local anesthesia need to make arrangements for transportation and be accompanied home.</p><p>If it is deemed safe to do so, antithrombotic therapy should be stopped one week prior to core biopsy, though some argue that for core biopsy, this may not be necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. For those in whom antithrombotic therapy cessation is contraindicated, fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is an appropriate initial biopsy approach. Core needle biopsy may still be performed safely in patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> anticoagulation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], but the patient should be informed of increased risk of hematoma. Alternatively, open biopsy can be performed, where bleeding can be directly controlled. (See <a href=\"#H20944863\" class=\"local\">'Choice of initial biopsy method'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-patients-receiving-anticoagulants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Increasingly, neoadjuvant therapy is being used to treat women with larger breast tumors. Clinical trials are the vehicle to accelerate the testing of new chemotherapeutic agents with the goal of improving survival at the time when they are most needed. Thus, being aware that patients with larger tumors should be enrolled in or referred to sites with neoadjuvant trials is critical to advancing the field.</p><p>Many centers can offer women the opportunity to participate in clinical trials, some of which require tissue for participation. Coordination of tissue collection for research at the time of diagnostic biopsy can spare patients a second biopsy for research; however, it may require tissue to be banked without a definitive diagnosis. </p><p>In patients with lesions that are highly likely to be invasive cancers (eg, BI-RADS 4C or 5 with lesions &gt;2 cm or with suspicious nodes) who are candidates for neoadjuvant therapy trials, several approaches can be taken: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some institutions have protocols for banking tissue at the time of biopsy in the event that cancer is detected, although this practice may result in additional tissue taken unnecessarily as it is not known at time of biopsy whether a patient is eligible for a research trial. (See <a href=\"#H20946029\" class=\"local\">'Core needle biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some institutions prefer to start with FNA, where a diagnosis can be made on the same day, facilitating a conversation about the diagnosis and subsequent core biopsy that serves to obtain both diagnostic and research cores at the same time. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Fine needle aspiration'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another approach in a patient with suspicious nodes is to start with a FNA of the lymph node. If that node is positive, then the diagnosis is known invasive disease, and counseling about treatment approaches, including neoadjuvant therapy and trials, can take place, allowing for a single procedure to get diagnostic material from the breast as well as research cores to enable study participation. (See <a href=\"#H20947616\" class=\"local\">'Axillary abnormalities'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20944808\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOPSY METHODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast biopsy methods include skin punch biopsy, fine needle aspiration (FNA), core needle biopsy (CNB), and surgical biopsy. In general, percutaneous biopsy should be performed as the first-line approach, followed by definitive surgery.</p><p>Most breast biopsy procedures can be performed under local anesthesia with the patient awake. Because surgical biopsy removes more tissue as a single specimen, conscious sedation or general anesthesia (intravenous or inhalational) may be needed for some patients undergoing a surgical biopsy (incisional or excisional). CNB takes multiple samples, sometimes a significant amount of tissue, but in small pieces, and is performed in the radiology suite usually using only local anesthetic. Sedation is not generally needed for CNB, but some facilities routinely administer short-acting anxiolytics. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20945985\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin punch biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small skin biopsy using a punch biopsy device can differentiate between benign and malignant skin changes. Punch biopsy may be needed if there is concern for Paget&rsquo;s disease, skin involvement with invasive breast cancer, or skin recurrence of breast cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paget-disease-of-the-breast\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paget disease of the breast&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Fine needle aspiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FNA biopsy is performed with a 10- or 20-mL syringe and a 23- to 27-gauge needle. While keeping negative pressure on the syringe, the needle is passed back and forth within the mass while rotating the wrist so that the needle is twisting. The specimen is then expelled into CytoLyt solution for evaluation by a cytopathologist. Pathologists may also prepare smears for quick stain to assess adequacy of the sampled material. Another technique for performing FNA biopsy is the French technique, in which the plunger is removed from the syringe, and the needle and syringe (without the plunger) is passed back and forth through the mass. The needle is removed from the breast, and the plunger is then replaced and used to expel the specimen. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1385681791\"><span class=\"h3\">Palpation-guided FNA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast-palpation-guided FNA has been used for years to evaluate a palpable breast mass. When a lesion is palpable, especially one that is large and obvious, fine needle aspiration can be rapidly performed as a non-image-guided procedure. It is critical to obtain appropriate breast imaging prior to any biopsy procedure to avoid potential confounding biopsy changes that can mimic malignancy. Careful radiologic-pathologic correlation is required for lesions deemed suspicious whether they are sampled by palpation or via image guidance. </p><p>Palpation-guided FNA can also be used to diagnose a breast cyst if breast ultrasound is not definitive. Any nonbloody fluid (eg, yellow, grey, green, blue, milk-white) aspirated from a cyst can be discarded unless there is a clinical or radiographic suspicion of an associated malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-13</a>]. Bloody fluid must be submitted for a cytologic evaluation as this indicates a lesion other than a simple cyst. The only exception is that of a traumatic aspirate, which is best judged by the individual performing the FNA. If there is any uncertainty, the fluid should be submitted for cytologic analysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cysts-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast cysts: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2059048166\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound-guided FNA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For nonpalpable lesions or vaguely palpable lesions, ultrasound (US) can be used to guide FNA. Additionally, US-guided FNA of palpable lesions increases the level of confidence that needle placement has been accurate. </p><p>A major advantage of FNA is that it is less invasive and can be easily and quickly performed at the time of a diagnostic study, with potential for an immediate preliminary interpretation. The main disadvantages of FNA cytology are the inability to distinguish between in situ and invasive cancer and the significant rate of nondiagnostic samples and false negative results in inexperienced hands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Successful use of FNA requires availability of cytology expertise. If excellent cytology is not available, then percutaneous CNB may be used. (See <a href=\"#H20946029\" class=\"local\">'Core needle biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20946029\"><span class=\"h2\">Core needle biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CNB is typically performed under local anesthesia. After infiltration of local anesthetic in the skin, a small skin incision is made through which the core biopsy needle (18-gauge [1.6 mm] to 9-gauge [3.8 mm diameter]) is introduced. The shortest path to the lesion should be chosen with some consideration of surgical planning so that the biopsy tract will be included in the surgical excision as well as patient safety (eg, staying parallel to the chest wall to avoid potential for pneumothorax) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H485284869\"><span class=\"h3\">Vacuum-assistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CNB can be performed with or without vacuum assistance. The use of the vacuum-assisted directional biopsy (VAB) device can permit the removal of a greater tissue volume (up to 1 cm in diameter using an 11-gauge device) compared with a non-vacuum-assisted CNB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Currently, 7-, 8-, 9- and 10-gauge VAB devices are also commercially available and can all be used successfully. Using a larger-diameter device will yield a larger volume of tissue. For example, the 8-gauge VAB device yields approximately 245 to 310 mg of tissue per core compared with the 11-gauge device, which yields 83 to 116 mg of tissue per core. From a diagnostic standpoint, increasing the volume of tissue in each core may be more important than increasing the number of core samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The accuracy of VAB was shown in a series of 942 consecutive breast CNBs performed at one institution (342 without image guidance, 241 with US guidance, and 369 using a stereotactic VAB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The false-negative rate with 11-gauge VAB was 3 percent, compared with 13, 5, and 22 percent for non-image-guided, surgeon-performed US-guided, and 14-gauge VAB respectively. Others report false-negative rates as low as 0.45 percent with 11-gauge VAB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/18,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21-23</a>]. Regardless of the number or size of core biopsy samples obtained, most important is ensuring adequate sampling of the intended target, for example, by demonstrating presence of targeted calcifications on specimen radiography and careful radiologic-pathologic correlation to ensure the pathologic diagnoses are concordant and explain the imaging findings. For US-guided procedures that allow real-time visualization, spring-loaded core biopsy is usually sufficient for diagnosis and is a lower-cost alternative to VAB devices. </p><p>In selected cases that are suspicious for malignancy, a second attempt at image-guided VAB may be performed after a review of the case between a radiologist and surgeon prior to definitive surgical excision, as a known malignant diagnosis will facilitate surgical planning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20946576\"><span class=\"h3\">Image-guidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CNB is most often performed with a form of image guidance, such as mammography (stereotactic, tomosynthesis), US, or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H725341632\"><span class=\"h4\">Mammography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One imaging method may demonstrate the lesion better than another, which dictates the choice of image modality. As an example, for lesions that are better seen mammographically but are difficult to reproduce reliably on US, stereotactic guidance is the preferred method. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H664216991\"><span class=\"h5\">Stereotactic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The stereotactic table allows mammographic guidance for core biopsy. Stereotactic biopsies can be done with the patient upright or prone, depending on the machine. For a prone stereotactic biopsy, the patient is prone on the table and her breast hangs through an opening in the table. A mammography unit is attached beneath the table allowing the radiologist to perform the procedure. While the majority of mammographic lesions can be biopsied via the stereotactic technique, some lesions are not suitable for stereotactic CNB, such as lesions close to the nipple or chest wall, or very faint calcifications. Some patients with small breast size or the inability to tolerate compression are also not suitable for stereotactic CNB. Patients who fail stereotactic biopsy (intolerance, inaccessible target) should be referred for excisional (surgical) biopsy for tissue diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H20945552\" class=\"local\">'Surgical biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H273675206\"><span class=\"h5\">Tomosynthesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with findings seen only at tomosynthesis (also known as &quot;3-D mammography&quot;), tomosynthesis-guided biopsy can be performed similarly to the stereotactic technique. Tomosynthesis-guided biopsy is an option available for some tomosynthesis units with upright stereotactic biopsy capability. More manufacturers are expected to offer this capability for the United States' market in the future. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast imaging for cancer screening: Mammography and ultrasonography&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2318146777\"><span class=\"h4\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>US-guided CNB of nonpalpable lesions is faster and better-tolerated by some patients than the stereotactic technique. The use of US requires that the lesion can be well-visualized by ultrasound and confidence that the US finding and mammographic finding represent the same thing. US-guided CNB may also be appropriate for palpable lesions. As an example, a palpable abnormality does not always correspond to the suspicious lesion being recommended for biopsy but instead may represent tissue anterior or adjacent to the lesion. Image guidance can also be useful to successfully biopsy lesions that are small, deep, or mobile and those that are only vaguely palpable that may no longer be palpable after the administration of local anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. With US-guided CNB, passage of the needle through the lesion can be directly seen and confirmed in real-time, increasing confidence that the correct lesion is sampled. Generally, fewer samples (usually three to five) are needed to provide diagnostic material with US-guided CNB. Clip placement is important to mark the biopsy site for future management and to ensure mammographic-sonographic concordance if the lesion is also seen at mammography. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clip placement'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3807486829\"><span class=\"h4\">Magnetic resonance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients will have nonpalpable, mammographically occult lesions that are seen only on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. A proportion can be identified on subsequent, targeted &quot;second-look&quot; US [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] and may then be biopsied under US guidance. US-correlated findings have a higher likelihood of malignancy, but lack of a sonographic correlate does not confer benignity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. In particular, lesion morphology at MR impacts success of finding an US correlate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. For lesions that lack a sonographic correlate, biopsy requires MR guidance. MR-guided biopsy may not be available at every facility, but each facility performing breast MR should have the means to perform any necessary MR-guided biopsies, whether at their own site or through a partnering facility.</p><p>Technologic advances have improved the efficiency of MR-guided biopsy, which can generally be performed in under an hour for a single target. However, unlike US, MR does not allow real-time monitoring of needle advancement and biopsy. Instead, the MR table brings the patient out of the MR bore for needle placement and sends the patient back into the MR bore for imaging to verify needle placement in a stepwise approach similar to that of computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy. Once adequate needle placement is confirmed, biopsy is performed with an MR-safe vacuum-assisted biopsy device (VAB). On average, an MR biopsy can be expected to last from 30 minutes to an hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/30-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-36</a>]. Imaging-histologic correlation is essential after MRI-guided VAB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. MRI-guided wire localization and surgical excision may be indicated if a suspicious lesion is not accessible to MRI-guided VAB or if the results are discordant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Some discordant cases will be found to represent false negatives of MR-guided biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H20945552\" class=\"local\">'Surgical biopsy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11833373\" class=\"local\">'Concordance'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Clip placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A clip should be placed in the region of the breast lesion at the time of a CNB to mark the biopsy site for subsequent management and follow-up. Different shapes or types of clips should be used if more than one lesion is biopsied in order to differentiate the various sites. This becomes especially important in the event that surgery is required for one of the lesions. If only one type of clip is available, one clip can be placed in one site and two in another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p>Clip placement is useful in several clinical settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Placement of a clip following US-guided CNB is important for documentation and for providing mammographic as well as sonographic correlation of lesion location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. For lesions originally detected on MR, assessing clip location on follow-up MR may often be required for sonographic-MR correlation. If a mammographic or MR finding is sampled via US guidance, it is important to check clip location to ensure concordance among the different imaging modalities. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the lesion is very small and might be completely removed by the CNB, a clip should be deployed at the biopsy site for future identification of the lesion site. Pre- and postprocedure 90-degree lateral and craniocaudal mammograms should be performed to ensure that the correct lesion has been biopsied and to determine the relationship of the clip to the lesion that was visualized prebiopsy. If residual abnormalities are not seen on the postprocedure mammogram, the area where the lesion had been can be localized using the clip as a reference point. For an ultrasound-only finding that &quot;disappears&quot; during the biopsy procedure, a clip should be placed as close as possible to the biopsy site provided the person performing the biopsy has maintained visualization of the location. If no clip can be placed, future localization may require use of the clock position and distance from the nipple as well as any available landmarks within the breast.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clip migration following biopsy has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. If feasible, an additional clip with a different shape may be placed at the true biopsy site. Alternatively, the distance from the original biopsy cavity to the clip can be measured, and procedure report should document the relative location of the biopsy site and the migrated clip. The report should specifically state that the migrated clip itself should <strong>not</strong> be used to localize the lesion during surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with larger primary breast cancer, the tumor site is commonly marked with a clip prior to administration of neoadjuvant therapy to localize the site of the original tumor bed, in case the patient has a clinical and radiographic complete response.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20945552\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, surgical biopsy should not be used as the initial breast biopsy method and should not be required in more than 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Surgical biopsy can remove the entire lesion (excisional biopsy) or only a portion of it (incisional biopsy). Whether to perform an incisional or excision biopsy depends upon the indications for the biopsy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incisional biopsy is used to confirm diagnosis when a skin punch biopsy is nondiagnostic or when a mass is too large to remove without significant cosmetic compromise. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excisional biopsy is used in cases where the lesion is in such a location that it is not amenable to CNB or where the result of a CNB is atypical or <span class=\"nowrap\">nondiagnostic/indeterminate,</span> is discordant with imaging results, or yields high-risk abnormalities such as atypical hyperplasia, radial scar, papilloma, or lobular carcinoma in situ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p/><p>In addition, a surgical biopsy may also be required when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cysts do not completely resolve after aspiration. Such lesions should undergo evaluation with a CNB if technically feasible or a surgical excision. However, excisional biopsy of simple cysts, clustered microcysts, or cysts with thin septa is not necessary.

(See <a href=\"#H11832603\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up imaging'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Excisional biopsies can generate scar tissue inside the breast that may prompt future diagnostic evaluation if prior mammograms are not available for comparison. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20945694\"><span class=\"h3\">Wire or other localization techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In women with nonpalpable lesions requiring excision, localization with wire or other techniques followed by surgical excision must be tailored to each case by the radiologist and the surgeon. </p><p>Localization before surgery is typically performed using a wire, which can be placed under mammographic, US, or MR guidance depending on the individual lesion and patient situation. A clip placed at the time of CNB will aid in wire localization of the biopsy area at the time of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. Localization techniques that do not require wire placement are also available and include placement of a radioactive seed or a radiofrequency identification tag [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/47-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-51</a>].

As an example, for patients found to have ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), complete excision of the entire lesion with appropriate margins is required for successful breast-conserving therapy.

This is due to the fact that the surgeon who is aware of the malignant nature of a lesion prior to excision may use a more aggressive surgical approach to obtaining clear resection margins. However, 20 percent of cases still have a positive histologic margin of excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

All specimens should be oriented by the surgeon. </p><p>Specimen radiography is essential to confirm the accurate removal of the mammographic abnormality and to guide the pathologist to the appropriate area for sectioning and microscopic study. Specimen radiography also confirms that the entire hook wire or alternative localization device(s) and any targeted clips have been removed. Visualization of the clip <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> foreign body material accompanying the clip helps the pathologist and the surgeon identify the prior biopsy site.</p><p>Specimen radiography can also show whether the lesion has been transected or is in close proximity to the edge of the specimen. In such cases, additional tissue may need to be removed to increase the likelihood of negative margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The best opportunity to achieve clear margins is at the time of the original surgical excision. Some centers and surgeons use digital imaging devices in the operating rooms (eg, Faxitrons) to provide an immediate picture of the specimen and improve the ability of the surgeon to see the lesion in relation to the margins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20944863\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF INITIAL BIOPSY METHOD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of an initial biopsy method depends upon whether or not the lesion is palpable and the type of imaging on which the lesion is best identified, while taking into account patient factors such as the ability to lie prone for a stereotactic biopsy. The radiologist should make an assessment of which modality and approach will yield the highest likelihood of success, taking into account potential ramifications for future treatment planning. In addition, it may be more prudent to perform a fine needle aspiration (FNA) or use a smaller-gauge core needle biopsy (CNB) of a lesion in a patient with unavoidable coagulation abnormalities. In axillary lymph nodes, FNA is less invasive and may be safer. Surgical biopsy should not be used as the initial biopsy method unless percutaneous biopsy is not feasible or available but may be required to further investigate discordant findings on percutaneous biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

As an example, a biopsy should be performed with image guidance when a palpable abnormality does not correspond to the suspicious lesion being recommended for biopsy but instead represents tissue anterior or adjacent to the lesion. </p><p>Ultrasound (US) can characterize a suspected cyst as benign, for which aspiration is only necessary when the patient is symptomatic. If FNA at a given institution is of high quality and reliable, it can be used as a definitive test for lesions that are indeterminate at ultrasound. For breast cysts that are aspirated (by palpation or ultrasound guidance), if the fluid is not frankly bloody, there is no need to send the fluid for cytology as the diagnostic yield is &lt;1 percent. If a presumed &quot;simple&quot; cyst does not resolve after ultrasound-guided therapeutic aspiration, the residual lesion should be biopsied (FNA or CNB) for diagnostic purposes and a clip marker placed. (See <a href=\"#H20946029\" class=\"local\">'Core needle biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p>At institutions with less-experienced cytopathologists to interpret FNA, CNB is the initial diagnostic procedure of choice for a palpable breast lesion that is suspicious for cancer. CNB offers a more definitive histologic diagnosis, avoids inadequate samples, and may permit the distinction between invasive versus in situ cancer. </p><p>However, when performed by experienced operators, FNA may still be the preferred biopsy technique in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. At some centers, FNA can be performed rapidly and immediate results obtained in patients with a suspected cancer, expediting early discussion about diagnosis and treatment. As discussed above, many of the clinical trials of neoadjuvant therapy available to women with stage II or III disease require a tissue core for research studies as well as histologic diagnosis. Once a decision has been made to pursue this approach, cores for diagnosis and research can then be obtained with one large CNB, avoiding the need for a second procedure. (See <a href=\"#H20945288\" class=\"local\">'Patient evaluation and preparation'</a> above.)</p><p>Proper lesion selection for FNA may play a role in determining the diagnostic yield. A greater amount of material can be aspirated from cellular lesions, such as infiltrating ductal carcinoma and metastatic lymph nodes, compared with less cellular lesions, such as hyalinized fibroadenomas, fibrotic lesions, or infiltrating lobular cancers. A CNB is more likely to provide a definitive diagnosis for less cellular lesions than FNA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20945302\"><span class=\"h2\">Mammographic abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most centers, CNB has replaced wire localization and excision as the most common initial biopsy method for nonpalpable mammographic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/1,54,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,54,59</a>]. For patients with microcalcifications, stereotactic vacuum-assisted biopsy is the standard approach; however, if calcifications are associated with a mass that can be seen at US, US-guided CNB can be performed followed by specimen radiography to confirm sampling of calcifications. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20947616\"><span class=\"h2\">Axillary abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with a suspicious Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)-category 4C or 5 lesion on mammography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F100197\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100197 \">table 1</a>), ultrasound scanning of the ipsilateral axilla should be performed to evaluate for abnormal axillary nodes. Percutaneous FNA of a suspicious node is an appropriate but not mandatory intervention; decisions about whether to biopsy the suspicious node percutaneously should be made in a multidisciplinary context. </p><p>In a patient with a marginally suspicious node by imaging where data about the node will not change the plan for the primary surgical therapy and where breast conservation is planned, node evaluation may be deferred until sentinel lymph node biopsy.

While adenocarcinoma cells are relatively easy to distinguish from normal lymphatic cells on FNA, cytokeratin stains may be required to distinguish lobular cells from lymphocytes in patients with invasive lobular cancer. Additionally, patients are often seen in multiple institutions, and the pathologist interpreting the FNA may not have access to all clinical data. </p><p>If malignant cells are present in the axillary lymph node FNA, the patient should be evaluated to determine if an axillary lymph node dissection is necessary at the time of the primary surgery. In patients with clinically positive nodes who are offered neoadjuvant therapy, a clip should be left in the biopsied axillary lymph node so that it can be removed at the time of sentinel lymph node biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/57,60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,60-62</a>].

Performing these assays on the core biopsy material can facilitate treatment by expediting discussions as to the need for, timing of, and type of adjuvant systemic therapy.

Radiologic-pathologic correlation should be performed for each case to ensure the pathologic diagnosis adequately explains the imaging findings. This requires concomitant review of the imaging findings and the pathology slides and may sometimes necessitate further tissue sampling. </p><p>Benign pathologies that include atypia need to be individually reviewed in conjunction with the imaging findings and clinical scenario.

However, &quot;atypia&quot; based on a single duct at pathology as an incidental finding is likely of no clinical significance. The clinician should take into account the patient's age, overall health, and breast cancer risk when making a final decision about what is appropriate. Going forward, there will be an increasing array of markers to help distinguish the risk imposed by the diagnosis of lesions, including ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>At our institution, the ultimate approach to management is individualized for each patient.

Since 1983, the incidence of invasive breast cancer has risen substantially, especially the incidence of cancers with less aggressive characteristics, such as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).</p><p>There is known variation in the diagnosis of atypia and DCIS, reflecting both intraobserver and interobserver variation. As an example, B-Path is a blinded study that quantified the magnitude of concordance of the interpretation of 6900 cases by&nbsp;115 pathologists with a consensus-derived reference diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The overall concordance rate was 75.3 percent. For invasive carcinoma, concordance was&nbsp;96 percent; 4 percent were under-interpreted. For DCIS, concordance was 84 percent;&nbsp;3 percent were over-interpreted and 13 percent&nbsp;were under-interpreted. For&nbsp;atypia, concordance was&nbsp;48 percent; 17 were over-interpreted and 35 percent were under-interpreted. Among benign cases without atypia, concordance was 87 percent, and 13&nbsp;percent were over-interpreted. Disagreement with the reference diagnosis was significantly higher among biopsies from women with higher compared with lower breast density on prior mammograms and among pathologists who interpreted lower weekly case volumes or worked in smaller practices or nonacademic settings. </p><p>The results of the B-Path study were criticized for not being reflective of general clinical practice, with higher proportions of DCIS and atypia represented than those typically seen in the general population. In a subsequent study, the results of the B-path study were adjusted according to the actual prevalence of various breast pathologies in women aged 50 to 59 years from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. The population-adjusted concordance rate was 92.3 percent (95% CI 91.4 to 93.1 percent) for all breast biopsies in the B-Path study; 4.6 and 3.2 percent of the cases were over- and under-interpreted, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy, however, differed significantly among the various pathologies. While more than 97 percent of the benign (without atypia and invasive breast cancer) interpretations were confirmed by the expert panel, 54 percent of the atypia diagnoses were over-interpreted, and 8.6 percent were under-interpreted. Similarly, 9 percent of the DCIS diagnoses were over-interpreted, and 12 percent were under-interpreted. </p><p>Note that pathologists interpreted biopsies in isolation in these research studies, but in clinical practice, pathologists often can confer with colleagues and can obtain additional information (eg, special stains, clinical presentation, imaging, and patient overall health and risk factors) to arrive at a conclusion.

Complications are few but include hematoma (3 percent or less) and infection (1 percent). Wearing a sports bra for support for two to three days (day and night) reduces discomfort and hematoma.

For most of our patients with concordant radiographic-pathologic findings, we perform radiographic imaging at approximately 12 months from the time of the CNB, which generally corresponds to the time of routine screening mammogram.

Imaging at &lt;12 months appears to have a low cancer detection yield. However, a shorter follow-up interval may be warranted for individuals with a solid and cystic lesion after ultrasound biopsy or a focal asymmetry after stereotactic biopsy with nonspecific benign pathology results.

A total of 17,631 biopsies with benign findings were identified. Similar rates of later cancer were detected for the groups with no significant differences in stage, tumor size, or nodal status. Thus, it appears to be safe for those with a benign radiologic-pathologic-concordant percutaneous breast biopsy to return to a normal screening schedule; however, the study did not identify the spatial relationship between the finding that prompted the initial biopsy and the site of the subsequent cancer (which could have represented a false-negative result). A shorter (six-month) follow-up interval may still be warranted based on radiologic-pathologic review and degree of sampling (for example, if only three core samples could be obtained at stereotactic biopsy due to patient intolerance).

For patients with palpable lesions highly suspicious for cancer, FNA may be used to rapidly provide a diagnosis and counsel patients, but a core needle biopsy (CNB) and clip placement will be required in the finding of a malignant diagnosis. The accurate interpretation of FNA cytology requires a highly experienced cytopathologist to avoid a high rate of nondiagnostic samples and false-negative results. Thus, some may opt to perform core biopsy for lesions that are highly suspicious for cancer instead. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Fine needle aspiration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with FNA, CNB offers a more definitive histologic diagnosis, has a lower rate of inadequate sampling, and can usually distinguish between invasive and in-situ cancer. CNB can be performed with mammographic (stereotactic or tomosynthesis), ultrasound, or magnetic resonance (MR) guidance. (See <a href=\"#H20946029\" class=\"local\">'Core needle biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For nonpalpable, mammographically occult lesions that can only be seen on MR imaging, targeted biopsy requires MR guidance. MR-guided wire localization and surgical excision may be indicated if a suspicious lesion is not accessible to vacuum-assisted directional biopsy (VAB) or if core biopsy results are discordant. (See <a href=\"#H3807486829\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical biopsy with wire or non-wire localization is performed to obtain a histologic diagnosis in patients in whom core needle biopsy (CNB) revealed a suspicious lesion but is not diagnostic or to guide definitive surgical excision of CNB-proven nonpalpable malignancy or calcifications near a known malignancy. Whole specimen radiograph is obligatory for clinically occult lesions excised under mammographic localization and to document complete removal of any localization devices. All specimens should be oriented by the surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H20945694\" class=\"local\">'Wire or other localization techniques'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clip should be placed in the region after a CNB as this will provide a target for presurgical localization of the proper area if the lesion will ultimately require excision. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clip placement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For malignant lesions, assay for expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and HER2 should be performed on the CNB or FNA material to facilitate treatment by expediting discussions as to the need for, timing of, and type of adjuvant systemic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H20944355\" class=\"local\">'Assay for hormone receptors and HER2'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a very suspicious lesion on mammography, ultrasound scanning of the ipsilateral axilla can be performed to evaluate suspicious abnormal axillary nodes. FNA of any suspicious areas in the axilla can then be performed at the time of percutaneous breast biopsy if preoperative axillary staging is desired. A marker clip may be placed at time of the percutaneous axillary lymph node biopsy to allow for intraoperative verification of removal of the involved node. (See <a href=\"#H20947616\" class=\"local\">'Axillary abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with benign CNB results, there must be pathologic-radiographic concordance. (See <a href=\"#H20947491\" class=\"local\">'Reviewing results'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11833373\" class=\"local\">'Concordance'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with discordant findings between benign pathologic results and a suspicious imaging study, additional tissue sampling is warranted (core biopsy or excisional biopsy). (See <a href=\"#H20949623\" class=\"local\">'Need for rebiopsy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with concordant benign but atypical lesions, the decision for surgical excision is based on radiologic-pathologic review and after consultation with a breast surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H20949623\" class=\"local\">'Need for rebiopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with concordant radiologic-pathologic findings after CNB, we recommend follow-up imaging at approximately 12 months. Shorter interval follow-up is reserved for limited specific scenarios. (See <a href=\"#H11832603\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up imaging'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-biopsy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Gutwein LG, Ang DN, Liu H, et al.
