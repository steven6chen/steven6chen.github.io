The discussion that follows is generally consistent with these guidelines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57942875\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PSC is usually a progressive disorder that ultimately leads to complications of cholestasis and hepatic failure. Median survival without liver transplantation after diagnosis is 10 to 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. Survival is significantly worse for patients who are symptomatic at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H57937219\" class=\"local\">'Complications of primary sclerosing cholangitis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H57939581\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57943234\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATION WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with PSC have underlying ulcerative colitis (UC); the prevalence of ulcerative colitis may be as high as 90 percent when rectal and sigmoid biopsies are routinely obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Because of this strong association, we evaluate patients diagnosed with PSC for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults#H25426712\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of ulcerative colitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Conversely, among patients with UC it has been estimated that PSC occurs in approximately 5 percent and perhaps less often in those with Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. As a result, we do not routinely screen patients with IBD for PSC. However, patients with IBD who have abnormal liver tests should be evaluated for PSC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary sclerosing cholangitis: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'PSC and inflammatory bowel disease'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with IBD and PSC may have a different phenotype than patients with IBD alone. Studies suggest that among patients with UC, pancolitis is more common in patients who also have PSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In addition, colon biopsies from patients with IBD and PSC may show active histologic activity despite minimal endoscopic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) may be asymptomatic and diagnosed as part of the evaluation of abnormal laboratory tests, or they may have symptoms such as fatigue and pruritus. Physical examination may reveal jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and excoriations, though it is often normal. Liver biochemical tests usually demonstrate a cholestatic pattern, with elevation of the serum alkaline phosphatase predominating in most patients. Radiographic findings include abnormal-appearing bile ducts with wall thickening, dilations, and strictures.</p><p>Patients may also have findings related to inflammatory bowel disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary sclerosing cholangitis: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'PSC and inflammatory bowel disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults#H1844647392\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of ulcerative colitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults#H12689029\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57935757\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately half of the patients with PSC are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], despite some already having advanced disease. PSC is often detected as part of the evaluation of abnormal liver tests in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Among patients who have symptoms, fatigue and pruritus are common. Little is known about the pathogenesis of fatigue; nevertheless, it may become quite debilitating.</p><p>Pruritus is a common symptom of PSC that can be extremely disabling, leading to severe excoriations and a decreased quality of life. The pathogenesis of pruritus in PSC, as in other disorders which cause cholestasis, is not clear. Several hypotheses have been proposed, including bile acid accumulation and endogenous opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Intractable pruritus is an indication for liver transplantation in patients with PSC. Patients with pruritus associated with cholestasis often have a normal bilirubin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pruritus associated with cholestasis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary sclerosing cholangitis in adults: Management&quot;, section on 'Liver transplantation'</a>.)</p><p>Fevers, chills, night sweats, and right upper quadrant pain can also be present. These features may represent episodic bacterial cholangitis from biliary obstruction rather than advanced disease. Liver biochemical tests may worsen during these episodes, but persistent jaundice usually reflects advanced disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57935765\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately half of patients with PSC will have a normal physical examination at the time of diagnosis. Abnormalities that may be detected on physical examination include jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and excoriations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liver biochemical tests usually demonstrate a cholestatic pattern, with elevation of the serum alkaline phosphatase predominating in most patients. The serum alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin may fluctuate substantially, possibly indicating transient blockage of strictured bile ducts by biliary sludge or small stones. The serum aminotransferases are typically less than 300 international <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span>. The serum albumin concentration is normal in patients with early stage disease, although those with active inflammatory bowel disease may have hypoalbuminemia.

Antimitochondrial antibodies, which are characteristic of primary biliary cholangitis, are usually absent in PSC. In one study, 71 of 73 (97 percent) patients with PSC were positive for at least one autoantibody, while 59 (81 percent) were positive for &ge;3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The presence of autoantibodies did not correlate with disease severity, with the exception of anticardiolipin antibodies, which correlated with the Mayo risk score. (See <a href=\"#H57939581\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Elevated serum immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) (a characteristic marker of autoimmune pancreatitis that is seen at lower levels in several other diseases) has been described in patients with PSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. In a report of 127 patients with PSC, 12 (9 percent) had values above the upper limit of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patients with elevated IgG4 may have a distinct entity, IgG4-associated cholangitis.

Ultrasound findings in patients with PSC include bile duct wall thickening and focal bile duct dilations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, gallbladder abnormalities such as wall thickening, enlargement, gallstones, cholecystitis, and mass lesions may also be seen in those who have developed complications. (See <a href=\"#H57937219\" class=\"local\">'Complications of primary sclerosing cholangitis'</a> below.)</p><p>Computed tomography may reveal thickening and inflammation of the bile ducts, saccular dilations of the intrahepatic duct, heterogenous bile duct dilation, evidence of portal hypertension (eg, varices), and mass lesions.</p><p>Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography findings in patients with PSC include multifocal, short, annular strictures that alternate with normal or mildly dilated segments. This results in a &quot;beaded&quot; appearance of the bile duct. Long strictures may also be seen and are concerning for cholangiocarcinoma.

The diagnosis is then made by showing cholangiographic evidence of characteristic bile duct changes (multifocal strictures, segmental dilations) and excluding secondary causes of sclerosing cholangitis. A percutaneous liver biopsy may support the diagnosis of PSC but is rarely diagnostic. In patients with characteristic findings on cholangiography, a liver biopsy is typically not required. However, a liver biopsy is required for patients with suspected small duct PSC. (See <a href=\"#H57939023\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to performing imaging to confirm a diagnosis of PSC, we also obtain an antimitochondrial antibody to help exclude primary biliary cholangitis and an immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) level, since patients with IgG4-associated disease may have a more rapidly progressive course and appear to be less likely to respond to corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57938995\"><span class=\"h2\">Cholangiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of PSC is typically established by the demonstration of characteristic multifocal stricturing and dilation of intrahepatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extrahepatic bile ducts on cholangiography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72605\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72605 \">image 2</a>). A cholangiogram may be obtained using magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69476\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69476 \">image 3</a>), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72605\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72605 \">image 2</a>), or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC). Because it is noninvasive with comparable diagnostic accuracy to ERCP, MRCP is typically the first test of choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,23</a>]. In a meta-analysis of six studies, the sensitivity and specificity of MRCP for diagnosing PSC were 86 and 94 percent, respectively. PTC is the most invasive approach and is reserved for patients who are unable to undergo ERCP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=percutaneous-transhepatic-cholangiography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>ERCP may be required in patients who are unable to undergo MRCP (eg, those with implanted metal devices) and in patients with early PSC since early changes may be missed by MRCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Finally, ERCP may be better than MRCP at detecting large-duct PSC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2223146\"><span class=\"h3\">Classic PSC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The biliary strictures in patients with PSC may be focal, with normal intervening areas, or diffuse, involving long segments. Strictures can occur in any part of the biliary tree. In one report of 100 patients, strictures were present in the following distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts &ndash; 87 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrahepatic bile ducts alone &ndash; 11 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extrahepatic bile ducts alone &ndash; 2 percent</p><p/><p>The gallbladder and cystic duct may also be involved. A study of 286 patients with PSC found one or more gallbladder abnormalities in 41 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Gallbladder findings were more common in those with extrahepatic PSC. A gallbladder mass lesion was found in 18 patients (6 percent), 10 of which represented gallbladder carcinoma, suggesting that cholecystectomy should be performed when such lesions are detected. Similar results have been reported by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

We reserve liver biopsy for patients with suspected small duct PSC or if other conditions such as an overlap syndrome with autoimmune hepatitis are suspected.

The components of the Mayo risk score include age, serum bilirubin, serum albumin, serum AST, and history of variceal bleeding. The calculation of this risk score correlates well with observed survival and is useful in assessing prognosis and determining timing for liver transplantation, although prioritization for transplantation is based upon the MELD score. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several groups have studied variables that appear to predict prognosis in PSC. These include age, histological stage, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, serum alkaline phosphatase, serum bilirubin, the presence of a dominant bile duct stricture, concurrent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and Candida in bile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6-8,77-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8,77-80</a>]. One study, for example, found that approximately 90 percent of those with stage II disease would be expected to progress to bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis, while approximately one-half of those who had already developed bridging fibrosis were expected to develop cirrhosis within five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>Concurrent IBD may also be associated with a poorer prognosis. In a study that compared 60 patients with PSC and IBD with 19 patients with PSC but without IBD, the presence of IBD was associated with a lower median age at presentation (46 versus 64 years), the development of serious malignant complications (23 versus 0 percent), and lower liver transplant-free survival (57 versus 84 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. A second study of 222 patients with PSC (167 with ulcerative colitis [UC] and 55 without UC) also found that patients with PSC associated with UC were diagnosed at a younger age than those without UC (median age at presentation 38 versus 47 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. It also found higher rates of dysplasia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> colon cancer among patients with UC (33 versus 2 percent). However, the presence of UC was not associated with death or liver transplantation after adjusting for sex, Mayo risk score, and year of diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is usually a progressive disorder that ultimately leads to complications of cholestasis and hepatic failure. Median survival without liver transplantation after diagnosis is 10 to 12 years. (See <a href=\"#H57942875\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with PSC may be asymptomatic and diagnosed as part of the evaluation of abnormal laboratory tests, or they may have symptoms such as fatigue and pruritus. Physical examination may reveal jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and excoriations, though it is often normal. Liver biochemical tests usually demonstrate a cholestatic pattern, with elevation of the serum alkaline phosphatase predominating in most patients. Radiographic findings include abnormal appearing bile ducts with wall thickening, dilations, and strictures. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PSC should be considered in patients with a cholestatic pattern of liver test abnormalities (particularly an elevated alkaline phosphatase), especially those with underlying inflammatory bowel disease. The diagnosis is then made by showing cholangiographic evidence of characteristic bile duct changes (multifocal strictures, segmental dilations) and excluding secondary causes of sclerosing cholangitis. A percutaneous liver biopsy may support the diagnosis of PSC, but it is rarely diagnostic. In patients with characteristic findings on cholangiography, a liver biopsy is typically not required. However, liver biopsy is required for patients with suspected small duct PSC or if other conditions such as an overlap syndrome with autoimmune hepatitis are suspected. (See <a href=\"#H57938956\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PSC needs to be differentiated from secondary causes of sclerosing cholangitis and IgG4-associated <span class=\"nowrap\">cholangitis/autoimmune</span> pancreatitis. In addition, PSC-autoimmune hepatitis overlap syndrome should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H57939023\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continued destruction of bile ducts in PSC leads to end-stage liver disease.
