Most vitamins are substances the body can't make on its own but that it needs to work well.</p><p>Vitamin supplements are pills, capsules, or liquids that have vitamins in them. Supplements are another way (besides food) that people can get vitamins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10874652\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I take vitamin supplements?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You probably do not need to take vitamin supplements if you are generally healthy and you eat a good diet. But it probably won't hurt to take a multivitamin or small doses of individual vitamins.</p><p>Experts recommend that most adults get their vitamins from food rather than from supplements. That's because eating vitamin-rich foods has other benefits besides getting you the vitamins you need. Still, there are some cases in which vitamin supplements can be helpful. For example, women who are pregnant or planning to get pregnant soon should take certain supplements. This is discussed in more detail below. There are also some groups of people who might benefit from vitamin supplements. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adults age 65 and older</strong> &ndash; Older adults might benefit from taking 600 to 800 units of vitamin D a day. This might help strengthen bones and prevent falls.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>People with vitamin deficiencies</strong> &ndash; A vitamin deficiency is when a person does not have enough of a particular vitamin for good health. People with vitamin deficiencies sometimes need to take vitamin supplements. If you have a vitamin deficiency, your doctor will tell you which supplements to take and at what dose. You might even need to get vitamin shots.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>People who have had weight loss surgery</strong> &ndash; People who have had weight loss surgery often can't get all the vitamins they need from food. If you have had weight loss surgery, ask your doctor if you need supplements. He or she can tell you which ones are best for you.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>People who do not eat any animal products (called &quot;vegans&quot;)</strong> &ndash; People who do not eat meat, eggs, milk, or other foods that come from animals sometimes need supplements. If you follow a vegan diet, ask your doctor or nurse if you should take any vitamin supplements.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10874667\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there any vitamin supplements I should not take?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Here are some vitamins supplements that can cause problems:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Vitamin A</a> &ndash; In places where people have good access to healthy food, such as the United States and Europe, doctors recommend against taking vitamin A supplements. That's because vitamin A supplements might increase the risk of cancer, heart disease, and bone fractures. In pregnant women, taking too much vitamin A can harm the baby.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin E &ndash; Doctors recommend against taking vitamin E supplements. Studies suggest that vitamin E supplements might increase the risk of dying.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10874682\"><span class=\"h1\">What's the best way to get the vitamins I need from food?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best way is to eat a diet that includes a lot of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and not a lot of meats or fatty foods. Some vitamins are found only in food that comes from animals, such as meat or eggs. But overall, fruits and vegetables have the highest concentrations of vitamins. Fruits and vegetables also have lots of fiber and other ingredients that generally promote good health.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10874699\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to try to get pregnant, take a &quot;prenatal&quot; multivitamin every day that has at least 400 micrograms of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a> (one of the B vitamins). Start taking the multivitamin at least a month <strong>before</strong> you actually start trying to get pregnant. Folic acid (sometimes called folate) helps prevent some birth defects.</p><p>It is important not to take too much of any vitamin during pregnancy, especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin A</a>. Show your doctor or nurse the vitamins you plan to take to make sure the doses are safe for you and your baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10874714\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b12-deficiency-and-folate-folic-acid-deficiency-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vitamin B12 deficiency and folate (folic acid) deficiency (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vitamin D deficiency (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-plan-and-prepare-for-a-healthy-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to plan and prepare for a healthy pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-before-and-during-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nutrition before and during pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diet-and-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diet and health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=health-and-nutrition-for-women-who-breastfeed-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Health and nutrition for women who breastfeed (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vitamin D deficiency (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diet-and-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diet and health (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-health-and-nutrition-during-breastfeeding-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Maternal health and nutrition during breastfeeding (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
