It is now one of the best characterized and understood autoimmune disorders. The hallmark of the disorder is a fluctuating degree and variable combination of weakness in ocular, bulbar, limb, and respiratory muscles. Weakness is the result of an antibody-mediated, T-cell dependent immunologic attack directed at proteins in the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction (acetylcholine receptors or receptor-associated proteins). The diagnosis of myasthenia gravis can be established by clinical and serologic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. Other aspects of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic approach to myasthenia is focused on confirming the clinical diagnosis established by the history and typical examination findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bedside tests (the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edrophonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edrophonium</a> test and the ice pack test) are easy to perform and are sensitive, but they have major limitations due to concerns about excess false-positive results. Confirmation by these tests alone is unwise.</p><p>More reliable laboratory methods that aid in the confirmation are serologic tests for autoantibodies and electrophysiologic studies (repetitive nerve stimulation studies and single-fiber electromyography [EMG]). It should be kept in mind that the diagnostic sensitivity of these studies also varies considerably depending on whether the patient has ocular or generalized disease.</p><p>The approximate diagnostic sensitivity of the confirmatory laboratory tests in myasthenia is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77349\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77349 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BEDSIDE TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ice pack test and the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edrophonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edrophonium</a> test should, in large part, be considered an extension of the neurologic examination rather than laboratory tests. Both of these bedside tests have a similar sensitivity and specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Ice pack test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ice pack test can be used in patients with ptosis, particularly those at a high risk of complications with the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edrophonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edrophonium</a> test. The ice pack test is also used if there is difficulty obtaining edrophonium. It is not helpful for those with extraocular muscle weakness. Since it is based on the physiologic principle of improving neuromuscular transmission at lower muscle temperatures, the eyelid muscles are the most easily cooled by the application of ice.</p><p>In the ice pack test, a bag (or surgical glove) is filled with ice and placed on the closed lid for two minutes. The ice is then removed and the extent of ptosis is immediately assessed. The sensitivity appears to be about 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>] in those with prominent ptosis. The predictive value of the test has not yet been established.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Edrophonium test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edrophonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edrophonium</a> (&quot;Tensilon&quot;) test should be used only in those patients with obvious ptosis or ophthalmoparesis, in whom improvement after infusion of the drug can easily be observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The difficulty in quantifying strength independent of volition in other muscle groups makes the interpretation of the response to edrophonium too unreliable.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=edrophonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Edrophonium</a> chloride is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with rapid onset (30 to 45 seconds) and short duration of action (5 to 10 minutes). This agent prolongs the presence of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction and results in an immediate increase in muscle strength in many of the affected muscles.</p><p>To perform the test, 1 mL of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edrophonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edrophonium</a> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> should be drawn up in a 1 cc tuberculin syringe, with an initial 2 mg test dose given intravenously. This can be followed by another 2 mg dose every 60 seconds up to a total dose of 10 mg. This incremental administration has a number of advantages. Most patients respond by the time 4 or 6 mg is delivered. Since the patient may not need the full 10 mg dose to see a positive response, excessive muscarinic side effects can often be avoided by this approach. In addition, in some patients the ocular muscles may strengthen at lower doses but then show a paradoxical response and weaken at higher doses of edrophonium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The incremental administration of edrophonium will not miss that window of effectiveness.</p><p>The injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edrophonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edrophonium</a> also potentiates the muscarinic effects of acetylcholine and is not without risk, especially in older adults, or those with cardiac disease or bronchial asthma. These medical conditions are relative contraindications for the edrophonium test. Patients frequently develop increased salivation and mild gastrointestinal cramping. More seriously, symptomatic bradycardia or bronchospasm can occur. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Atropine</a> (0.4 to 0.6 mg) should be ready in a separate syringe before the edrophonium is administered. Atropine can then be readily delivered intravenously should these adverse effects occur. Although serious complications of bradycardia and syncope are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], cardiac monitoring or avoiding this test altogether is prudent in older adults or those with a history of arrhythmia or heart disease.</p><p>The sensitivity of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edrophonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edrophonium</a> test is in the range of 80 to 90 percent, but it is associated with many false-negative and false-positive results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/2,3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,6</a>]. Some patients with clearly established myasthenia gravis may have equivocal or no response to the edrophonium. On the other hand, a positive test is not specific for myasthenia, as it can also occur in other conditions, such as motor neuron disease, brainstem tumors, and compressive cranial neuropathies, which can present in a similar fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SEROLOGIC TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myasthenia gravis is a condition that fulfills all the major criteria for a disorder mediated by autoantibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR-Ab), or against a receptor-associated protein, muscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK-Ab). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with positive AChR-Ab or MuSK-Ab assays have seropositive myasthenia gravis (SPMG). Demonstration of these antibodies, possible in approximately 90 percent of patients with generalized disease, provides the laboratory confirmation of myasthenia gravis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In those with purely ocular myasthenia, the sensitivity of AChR-Ab testing is considerably lower, detectable in about half of patients. There are rare cases of ocular myasthenia that are MuSK-Ab positive, but most large case series of ocular myasthenia gravis have not found patients who are MuSK-Ab positive (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ocular-myasthenia-gravis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ocular myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Serum antibody studies'</a>). Although the sensitivity of these antibodies varies by disease (ocular versus generalized), their specificity in myasthenia gravis is very high (eg, 99 percent for the AChR binding antibodies).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Acetylcholine receptor antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An immunologic assay to detect the presence of circulating acetylcholine receptor antibodies (AChR-Ab) is the first step in the laboratory confirmation of myasthenia. There are three AChR-Ab assays: binding, blocking, and modulating. Most authors use the term AChR-Ab as synonymous with the binding antibodies and these are what are referred to in most studies that report the diagnostic sensitivity of these tests in myasthenia gravis for the reasons discussed below. These antibodies are polyclonal and are present in approximately 85 percent of patients with generalized disease. Essentially all patients (98 to 100 percent) with myasthenia gravis and thymoma are seropositive for these antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The negative predictive value of thymoma in the absence of acetylcholine antibodies (binding) is high at 99.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The assay for the binding antibody is the most sensitive. One study found these antibodies in 93, 88, and 71 percent of individuals with moderate to severe generalized myasthenia gravis, mild generalized myasthenia, and ocular myasthenia, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Others have found binding AChR-Ab in 80 to 90 percent of those with generalized disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/2,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11,12</a>], and in 40 to 55 percent of those with ocular myasthenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ocular-myasthenia-gravis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ocular myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Serum antibody studies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Binding AChR antibodies are measured by standard radioimmunoassay and are highly specific for myasthenia gravis. There are virtually no false-positive results in healthy or disease-matched populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. There are rare false positives in low titers in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (5 percent), motor neuron disease (3 to 5 percent), and polymyositis (&lt;1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/10,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15,16</a>]. They are also rarely seen in some disorders that are not usually confused with myasthenia: primary biliary cholangitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, thymoma without myasthenia, and in first-degree relatives of patients with myasthenia gravis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blocking AChR-Ab are present in about half of patients with generalized disease. They are present in fewer than 1 percent of patients with negative binding antibodies, but they have no significant false positives.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assays for modulating AChR-Ab increase the sensitivity by &le;5 percent when added to the binding studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and false-positive results are more of a problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>Binding antibody studies are sufficient in most circumstances. The blocking and modulating antibody assays add relatively little to the diagnostic sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the demonstration of blocking antibodies may be helpful if a possible false-positive binding antibody result is suspected.</p><p>AChR-Ab titers correlate poorly with disease severity between patients. A low-titer or even antibody-negative patient may have much more severe clinical disease than a patient with high titers. </p><p>In addition, it is not helpful to follow the AChR-Ab levels as a marker for improvement in all patients being treated for myasthenia gravis. This issue is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis#H2362131414\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Monitoring response to immunotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>Ideally, serologic testing for AChR-Ab should be performed prior to initiating immune modulating therapy for myasthenia gravis, as such therapy can sometimes lead to apparent seronegativity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In one cohort of 143 seropositive patients, 9 percent became seronegative after treatment when retested in clinical remission. In addition, repeat serologic testing 6 to 12 months after initial testing has been reported to detect positive seroconversion in approximately 15 percent of patients with myasthenia gravis who were initially seronegative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/12,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">MuSK antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibodies to the muscle specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) are present in 38 to 50 percent of those with generalized myasthenia gravis who are AChR-Ab negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/12,20-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,20-26</a>]. MuSK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates agrin-dependent AChR clustering and neuromuscular junction formation during development. MuSK antibody positive myasthenia gravis may have a different cause and pathologic mechanism than AChR-Ab positive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/20,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'MuSK antibodies'</a>.)</p><p>MuSK antibodies are generally not present in those with well-established ocular myasthenia gravis, but they have been detected in a few cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Although nearly half of patients with AChR-Ab negative myasthenia gravis will have MuSK antibodies, those with AChR-Ab positive myasthenia do not have antibodies to MuSK in most studies to date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/20-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-25</a>]. However, one group found that 11 percent of patients with AChR-Ab positive myasthenia did have antibodies to MuSK as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. MuSK antibodies appear to be much less common in some AChR-Ab negative myasthenia populations, being found in only 1 of 27 Taiwanese patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] and 0 of 17 Scandinavian patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>One consistent finding is that patients with AChR-Ab negative myasthenia gravis and MuSK antibodies have a much lower frequency of thymic pathology than patients with AChR-Ab positive myasthenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. Thymic hyperplasia is frequent in AChR-Ab positive myasthenia, but this pathology is much less frequent in the MuSK-Ab positive group. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'MuSK antibodies'</a>.)</p><p>In the appropriate clinical setting (ie, a patient with the typical clinical features of myasthenia gravis (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below) who is AChR-Ab negative), MuSK antibody testing can clarify the diagnosis and perhaps direct treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with AChR-Ab negative myasthenia gravis who are MuSK-Ab positive share most of the clinical manifestations of generalized myasthenia.

However, they are typically more symmetric, less severe, and less likely to fluctuate compared with ocular involvement in &quot;typical&quot; AChR-Ab positive myasthenia gravis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Seronegative myasthenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term seronegative myasthenia gravis, also called antibody-negative myasthenia gravis, refers to the 6 to 12 percent of patients with myasthenia who have negative standard assays for both AChR antibodies and MuSK antibodies. The term was previously used only for those who were AChR antibody negative, regardless of MuSK antibody status. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Seronegative myasthenia'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with seronegative myasthenia gravis are more likely to have purely ocular disease than those who are seropositive. There is also a trend for those with generalized seronegative myasthenia to have a better outcome after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Seronegative myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder with most of the same features as seropositive myasthenia gravis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/19,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,26</a>]. The electrophysiologic findings are identical. Patients with seronegative myasthenia respond in a similar fashion to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a>, plasma exchange, glucocorticoids, and immunosuppressive therapies, as well as thymectomy.</p><p>Newer diagnostic antibody assays may further reduce the percentage of patients that are considered seronegative. As an example, up to 50 percent of patients with seronegative myasthenia gravis have low-affinity acetylcholine receptor antibodies (also called clustered AChR antibodies) when tested by a specialized cell-based immunofluorescence assay. These assays are not commercially available and are not in widespread clinical use. </p><p>Other studies have demonstrated antibodies against LRP4, an agrin receptor required for agrin-induced activation of MuSK and AChR clustering and neuromuscular junction formation. These antibodies have been found in 2 to 50 percent of patients with seronegative myasthenia gravis. Antibodies against LRP4, as well as cortactin, have been found in both seronegative and seropositive patients. The role of these antibodies in the pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis has not been established. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of these antibodies are not well-delineated, so the role of these as diagnostic markers for myasthenia gravis is uncertain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Seronegative myasthenia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Other antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anti-striated muscle antibodies target heterogeneous striated muscle proteins.

These antibodies may be a useful marker for thymoma in those patients between 20 and 50 years of age (ie, early onset myasthenia gravis). In this cohort, thymoma can be found in 60 percent of patients with anti-striated muscle antibodies, but in less than 10 percent of those without these antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/9,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,42</a>]. The false-positive rate (striational antibodies present without thymoma) is under 10 percent, but it rises to 50 percent in those 40 to 50 years of age or older. Below 20 years of age, the likelihood of thymoma is low.</p><p>Although they have limited clinical utility, measurement of other skeletal muscle protein antibodies may potentially be more helpful than striational antibodies in predicting the presence of a thymoma and assessing disease prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>]. One study demonstrated that antibodies to titin, an intracellular muscle protein, were found in 95 percent of patients with myasthenia gravis and thymoma, but also 50 percent of those without thymoma.

However, the standard AChR binding antibody assays have a negative predictive value that is equally good (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Acetylcholine receptor antibodies'</a> above).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrodiagnostic-evaluation-of-the-neuromuscular-junction#H9468271\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrodiagnostic evaluation of the neuromuscular junction&quot;, section on 'Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS)'</a>.)</p><p>Due to their wide availability, RNS studies are the most frequently used electrodiagnostic test for myasthenia gravis. The test is performed by placing the recording electrode over the endplate region of a muscle and stimulating the motor nerve to that muscle. The nerve is electrically stimulated 6 to 10 times at low rates (2 or 3 Hertz). The compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude is recorded from the electrodes over the muscle after electrical stimulation of the nerve. In normal muscles, there is no change in CMAP amplitude with repetitive nerve stimulation. In myasthenia there may be a progressive decline in the CMAP amplitude with the first four to five stimuli (a decremental response).</p><p>An RNS study is considered positive (ie, abnormal) if the decrement is greater than 10 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75502\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef75502 \">waveform 1</a>). It is important to sample distal and proximal muscle to maximize the yield. Distal muscles are technically easier, but they have a lower diagnostic sensitivity. If possible, clinically weak muscles should be included as well. To maximize the sensitivity, the muscles tested should be warm, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors should be held for 12 hours before the study.</p><p>A suitable RNS study usually consists of low-rate (at 2 or 3 Hz) stimulation with one or two trains of 6 to 10 stimuli and CMAP recordings at rest, followed by an exercise protocol. In the exercise protocol, the patient is asked to exercise the muscle maximally for 30 to 60 seconds. A train of stimuli is performed immediately after exercise. A repair of the CMAP decremental response (a smaller percent decrement compared with the decrement seen at rest) is commonly seen, reflecting postexercise or postactivation facilitation. An additional train of stimuli is delivered at one, three, and five minutes after exercise. This may result in a larger decrement than seen at rest, termed postexercise or postactivation exhaustion. This exercise protocol may increase the sensitivity of RNS by an additional 5 to 10 percent.</p><p>RNS studies are positive in approximately 75 to 80 percent of patients with generalized myasthenia if recordings are made from proximal (usually trapezius and orbicularis oculi), as well as distal muscles. However, the sensitivity of RNS is much lower (eg, 15 to 45 percent) in patients with ocular myasthenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ocular-myasthenia-gravis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ocular myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Repetitive nerve stimulation'</a>.)</p><p>A decremental response is not specific for myasthenia gravis. Decrements may be seen in other disorders of neuromuscular transmission (Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome or botulism) and motor neuron disease. These disorders should not cause electrodiagnostic confusion when combined with studies looking for presynaptic disorders of neuromuscular transmission and standard needle electromyography.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Single-fiber electromyography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG) is reviewed here briefly and discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

This technique allows simultaneous recording of the action potentials of two muscle fibers innervated by the same motor axon. The variability in time of the second action potential relative to the first is called &quot;jitter.&quot; Any disorder, such as myasthenia gravis, that reduces the safety factor of transmission at the neuromuscular junction will produce increased jitter. To maximize the sensitivity, a limb and facial muscle may be studied.</p><p>SFEMG is positive in greater than 90 percent of those with generalized myasthenia. In ocular myasthenia gravis, the diagnostic sensitivity of SFEMG ranges from 80 to 95 percent if a facial muscle is studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Muscles studied were the orbicularis oculus (89 percent), the frontalis (10 percent), and the extensor digitorum communis (4 percent). Over a mean follow-up period of 9.5 months, the clinical diagnosis was ocular myasthenia gravis (19 percent), generalized myasthenia gravis (12 percent), and no myasthenia of either type (69 percent). The sensitivity of SFEMG for ocular myasthenia gravis and generalized myasthenia gravis was 73 and 85 percent, respectively, while the specificity for either type of myasthenia was 91 percent. The positive and negative predictive values were 77 and 91 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p>Abnormal jitter is not specific for myasthenia. It may be abnormal in motor neuron disease, polymyositis, peripheral neuropathy, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, and other neuromuscular disorders. However, it is specific for a disorder of neuromuscular transmission when no other abnormalities are seen on standard needle EMG examination. The exception may be in differentiating patients suspected of ocular myasthenia gravis from those with Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) causing chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO). Two reports give conflicting data: in the presence of a normal needle EMG examination, one showed abnormal SFEMG in CPEO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], and the other did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>SFEMG should be performed with caution, or not at all, in those patients who have received botulinum injections for migraine, dystonia, or other indications.

In those with thymic pathology, thymic hyperplasia is most common (85 percent), but various thymic tumors (primarily thymoma) are present in up to 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].
