It is a bacterial infection caused by six species in the spirochete family <em>Borreliaceae</em>. The taxonomy of these spirochetes is undergoing revision, and the genus name may be represented as either <em>Borrelia</em> or <em>Borreliella</em>. In either case, the abbreviation for the genus is &quot;B&quot; and stands for both terminologies in the discussion below. </p><p>In<em> </em>North America, infection<em> </em>is caused primarily by <em>B. burgdorferi</em> and, less commonly, in a region of the upper mid-West, by <em>B. mayonii. </em>In Europe and Asia<em>, </em>infection is caused primarily by either <em>B. afzelii</em> or <em>B. garinii</em>, less commonly by <em>B. burgdorferi</em>, and rarely by <em>B. spielmanii</em> or <em>B. bavariensis</em>. There is a broad spectrum of manifestations, and severity of disease is due, in part, to differences in the infecting species.</p><p>The diagnosis of Lyme disease will be reviewed here.

However, the clinical features of each stage can overlap, and some patients present in a later stage of Lyme disease without a history of prior signs or symptoms suggestive of earlier Lyme disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early localized disease is characterized by the appearance of the characteristic skin lesion, erythema migrans (EM), with or without constitutional symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81270\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81270 \">picture 1</a>). EM usually occurs within one month following the tick bite.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early disseminated disease is characterized by multiple EM lesions (that typically occur days to weeks after infection) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiac findings (that typically occur weeks to months after infection). Some of these patients have no history of antecedent early localized Lyme disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late Lyme disease is typically associated with intermittent or persistent arthritis involving one or a few large joints, especially the knee (sometimes preceded by migratory arthralgias); <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> certain rare neurologic problems, primarily a subtle encephalopathy or polyneuropathy. Late Lyme disease may develop months to a few years after the initial infection. Arthritis may be the presenting manifestation of the disease.</p><p/><p>The clinical manifestations of Lyme disease are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-clinical-manifestations-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lyme disease: Clinical manifestations in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For clinicians practicing in nonendemic areas for Lyme disease who see patients with possible Lyme disease, it is especially important to obtain a detailed travel and activity history, with inquiries about prior residences and prior clinical findings that might be consistent with manifestations of Lyme disease. For example, an erythema migrans (EM)-like skin lesion is often misdiagnosed as either a spider bite or as community-acquired cellulitis due to pyogenic bacteria. Such patients are often treated with a first-generation cephalosporin (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cephalexin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cephalexin</a>), which is ineffective for treating Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43075543\"><span class=\"h2\">Early Lyme disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of early Lyme disease should be made on clinical grounds alone when a characteristic erythema migrans lesion is present in patient who lives in or has recently traveled to an endemic area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81270\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81270 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67424\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67424 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is important to recognize that the patient who presents with an EM lesion will likely be seronegative, since the lesion often appears prior to development of a diagnostic, adaptive immune response. Serologic testing is neither required nor recommended in such patients. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Lack of sensitivity in early disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43075550\"><span class=\"h2\">Early disseminated and late Lyme disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By the time the patient has findings of early disseminated disease (eg, multiple EM skin lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75337\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75337 \">picture 3</a>), lymphocytic meningitis, facial palsy, radiculoneuropathy, or carditis with heart block), serologic tests are usually positive for both IgM and IgG antibodies to <em>B. burgdorferi</em>. Patients suspected of having early neuroborreliosis or Lyme carditis should undergo a complete skin examination to search for an EM skin lesion that the patient may not have noticed. In patients with late disease (eg, Lyme arthritis), serologic tests should be positive for IgG antibodies to <em>B. burgdorferi</em>. In patients with either early disseminated or late disease, the diagnosis of Lyme disease is based upon a compatible clinical syndrome in a patient who resides in or has visited an endemic region in conjunction with a positive serologic test. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Serologic testing'</a> below.)</p><p>Some patients with early disseminated disease have an EM lesion that can be found on a careful skin examination; others do not. The absence of either an EM skin lesion or a tick bite or both should <strong>not</strong> be interpreted as excluding the diagnosis of Lyme disease. </p><p>The diagnosis of specific manifestations of Lyme disease is discussed in greater detail separately.

STARI follows the bite of the <em>Amblyomma americanum</em> tick, not the <em>Ixodes</em> species tick, which is the tick that harbors <em>B. burgdorferi</em>. The cause of STARI is not known. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=southern-tick-associated-rash-illness-stari\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of Lyme disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The potential diagnosis of STARI is a reason to obtain a careful travel and residence history and to determine the likelihood of tick exposure during time in endemic areas. Although the range of <em>A. americanum </em>and<em> I. scapularis</em> ticks overlap, the incidence of STARI is felt to be low in areas where Lyme disease is endemic; thus, EM-like lesions from these geographic regions should be managed as Lyme disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-lyme-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Early disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43075402\"><span class=\"h2\">Distinction from fibromyalgia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with nonspecific articular or neurologic symptoms are incorrectly diagnosed with &quot;chronic Lyme disease.&quot; In patients with noninflammatory musculoskeletal pain, cognitive complaints, fatigue, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> irritability, the diagnosis is more likely fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Fibromyalgia is a common chronic disorder that is characterized by pain in muscles and associated fibrous tissue and occurs in 2 percent of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Physical examination reveals multiple &quot;trigger points&quot; near joints. However, in contrast to Lyme disease, fibromyalgia is not an inflammatory or infectious disorder. Thus, an important distinction between these two clinical entities is the presence of objective evidence of inflammation or organ system dysfunction in patients with late features of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">CDC criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have developed a definition of Lyme disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63453\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63453 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This definition was not intended to be used by clinicians to make a diagnosis of Lyme disease, since it is not comprehensive. However, the vast majority of cases of Lyme disease in practice do fulfill the case definition. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-Lyme disease syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In untreated patients, objective manifestations of late Lyme disease, such as monoarticular or oligoarticular arthritis, may persist for several years. However, there is no evidence that persistent subjective symptoms after antibiotic treatment, often referred to as post-Lyme disease syndrome or chronic Lyme disease, respond to antibiotic courses longer than those that are recommended (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59949\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59949 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. In addition, Lyme disease should never be a diagnosis of exclusion to explain puzzling complaints, particularly when they are not accompanied by objective markers of organ damage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inflammation. A more detailed discussion of post-Lyme disease syndrome is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-lyme-disease#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Post-Lyme disease syndrome and chronic Lyme disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SEROLOGIC TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic testing is an important tool for the diagnosis of Lyme disease among patients in endemic areas with constellations of symptoms consistent with Lyme disease. The key to the appropriate use of serologic testing is in its application to appropriate patients, as discussed below. Serologic testing for antibodies to <em>B. burgdorferi</em> should be seen as an adjunct to the clinical diagnosis and can neither establish nor exclude the diagnosis of Lyme disease. A positive or negative serologic test for Lyme disease simply changes the probability that a patient has been infected with <em>B. burgdorferi</em>. (See <a href=\"#H27411155\" class=\"local\">'Ability to confirm active disease'</a> below.)</p><p>The American College of Physicians has published a position paper on laboratory evaluation in the diagnosis of Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In addition, the Infectious Diseases Society of America has issued guidelines for the clinical assessment and treatment of patients suspected of having Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for serologic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic testing should be performed in patients who meet <strong>all</strong> of the following criteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A recent history of having resided in or traveled to an area endemic for Lyme disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><strong>and</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A risk factor for exposure to ticks</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><strong>and</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms consistent with early disseminated disease or late Lyme disease (eg, meningitis, radiculopathy, mononeuritis, cranial nerve palsy, arthritis, carditis) </p><p/><p>Serologic testing for Lyme disease should <strong>not</strong> be performed in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with an erythema migrans (EM) rash.

The traditional two-tiered testing algorithm uses a sensitive enzyme immunoassay, such as a whole cell-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) followed by a more specific Western blot test. Separate IgM and IgG blots are typically performed. A different type of enzyme immunoassay (an immunofluorescent assay [IFA]) may be substituted for the whole cell ELISA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

If a patient has a positive IgM ELISA and IgM Western blot after that time, but a negative IgG blot, the IgM test most likely represents a false-positive result, or possibly evidence of past treated infection.</p><p>The use of alternative testing algorithms is discussed below.

The combined preparation is most commonly used. </p><p>Since the antigen used in the whole cell-based ELISA test is derived from the lysates of the organism, cross-reaction with antibodies to other organisms due to similarity to <em>B. burgdorferi</em> antigens can occur. At least 5 percent of the normal population will test positive for antibodies to <em>B. burgdorferi</em> by whole cell-based ELISA due to cross-reacting antibodies elicited either by other infections or by the immune response to normal flora [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. </p><p>False-positive IgM testing is much more common than false-positive IgG testing, although both can occur.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>False-positive ELISA testing can be seen with patients with other Borrelial diseases (eg, relapsing fever, <em>Borrelia miyamotoi</em> disease), other spirochetal diseases (eg, syphilis, leptospirosis, pinta, yaws, gingivitis), other bacterial infections (eg, infective endocarditis), viral illnesses, and autoimmune diseases (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, cross-reacting antibodies may be produced due to nonspecific activation of immunoglobulin production (eg, polyclonal B cell activation).

Separate Western blots are performed to detect either IgM or IgG antibodies. Information learned from studies correlating cases of clinically diagnosed Lyme disease with patterns of reactivity on Western blot have enabled the CDC to recommend evidence-based criteria for Western blot interpretation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50882\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50882 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Seropositivity alone, however, is insufficient to make a diagnosis of active Lyme disease. Antibodies may persist for years after Lyme disease has been treated and cured. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Persistence of antibodies'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnosis of extracutaneous Lyme disease depends upon having the appropriate clinical features in conjunction with seropositivity. Serologic tests have great value when used in the right settings. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If serologic testing is used in a population where Lyme disease is highly likely (ie, patients with isolated monoarthritis or bilateral facial nerve palsy), a positive test strongly supports the clinical diagnosis of Lyme disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In late Lyme disease, such as late neuroborreliosis or Lyme arthritis, seropositivity by two-tier testing with a positive IgG Western blot, specifically, is virtually universal. Absence of IgG seroreactivity in such a patient excludes the diagnosis of Lyme disease.</p><p/><p>A more detailed discussion of the approach to diagnosis is found above.

However, only 20 to 40 percent of patients with early localized Lyme disease (EM) are seropositive at the time of presentation using the two-tier serologic method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. Thus, patients with skin lesions that are typical of EM do not require confirmatory serologic testing. The presence of EM is in itself sufficient to make a diagnosis of Lyme disease in patients living in or traveling from endemic areas. If the cause of the skin lesion is in doubt, acute and convalescent phase (approximately two to four weeks after the acute serum sample) serologic testing may be helpful.</p><p>In comparison to the findings in early localized disease, most patients with early disseminated extracutaneous Lyme disease (eg, early neuroborreliosis or Lyme carditis) are seropositive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Those with suspected early disseminated Lyme disease who are initially seronegative should undergo repeat serologic testing approximately two weeks after the initial evaluation.

Variability is typically greatest during the early stages of disease and particularly for IgM tests (both ELISA and Western blot). Inter- and intralaboratory concordance of serologic results improves during late stage disease and approaches 100 percent for IgG testing in patients with disease for greater than three months when standard CDC criteria are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'CDC criteria'</a> above.). </p><p>These findings were illustrated in a study that compared the variability of different serologic tests at university-based, commercial-based, and specialty&ndash;based laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Sera from 37 patients with posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome, as well as 40 healthy controls without prior Lyme disease, were tested at four laboratories. There was no significant difference in the percent of positive ELISA and IgG western blots when CDC criteria were used. However, in one laboratory, the specificity declined significantly when their own in-house criteria were used to diagnose Lyme disease. Thus, results from laboratories that have established their own criteria for interpreting the Western blot should be viewed with skepticism. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Western blot'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27411277\"><span class=\"h4\">Sensitivity for different B. burgdorferi species and strains</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ELISA and Western blot tests available in the United States are optimized for detection of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> sensu stricto. Sensitivity of these tests for strains of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> sensu lato present in Europe and Asia (<em>B. garinii</em> and <em>B. afzelii</em>) is often reduced. The VlsE C6 epitope is relatively stable between European and US species, and thus VlsE C6 ELISAs may be a more appropriate test for detecting all species of <em>B. burgdorferi</em>. Limited data also suggest that detection of a newly identified strain of <em>Borrelia</em> causing Lyme disease in the Midwestern United States, <em>B. mayonii</em>, may not be as reliably detected by the western blot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Even among <em>B. burgdorferi</em> sensu stricto strains in the US the sensitivity of the Western blot for detection may vary significantly. Borrelial strains may be classified by ribosomal spacer type (RST). In culture-proven cases of infection, two-tier testing was less sensitive than VlsE C6 ELISA testing in detecting antibodies in RST types 2 (37 percent positive versus 66.7 percent positive, respectively) and 3 (25 percent positive versus 75 percent positive) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Detection of RST type 1 strains were equivalent. The loss of sensitivity in the two-tier approach was mainly due to decreased sensitivity of the Western blot.

In that case, the illness has been treated successfully, and symptoms resolve.</p><p>For patients that do seroconvert, the amount of antibody declines after successful treatment; however, both IgM and IgG antibodies can remain elevated for months or years despite successful antibiotic therapy and complete resolution of symptoms. Accurately determining a decline in the amount of antibody by ELISA requires testing serial samples together in the same assay, but such samples are not usually available. Western blotting, a nonquantitative test, is slower to change as the specific antibody levels must decline to the level of uninfected controls.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h4\">Vaccine recipients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the Lyme vaccine (LYMErix) is no longer available, confusion may arise when serologic testing is done in previously vaccinated individuals. Immunization with LYMErix induces antibodies that can interfere with the serologic diagnosis of Lyme disease by causing a positive ELISA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/23,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,35,36</a>]. Patients who have been vaccinated for Lyme disease also may display several positive bands on Western blot testing; usually this does not result in interpretation of the Western blot as a false-positive, although it can in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The duration of vaccine-induced interference with diagnostic testing by ELISA is not clear, but it may be at least several years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h4\">Persistence of antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibody titers to <em>B. burgdorferi</em> decline gradually after successful antibiotic treatment of Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. However, positive responses often persist for years, albeit at lower titers, after successful treatment. In one study of 40 patients who had early Lyme disease 10 to 20 years earlier, 10 percent still had IgM responses to <em>B. burgdorferi</em> and 25 percent still had IgG reactivity by ELISA and Western blot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Among 39 patients who had had Lyme arthritis 10 to 20 years earlier, 15 percent still had IgM responses and 62 percent still had IgG responses by two-tier testing. Antibodies measured using the VlsE C6 peptide ELISA test may decline more rapidly than other tests after treatment for infection, but decline of antibodies using this method is also unpredictable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Routine follow-up serologic testing is <strong>not</strong> recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27411375\"><span class=\"h4\">Reinfection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since many patients live in endemic areas, reinfection after antibiotic therapy is not an uncommon occurrence. Most reinfection is diagnosed by identification of a new erythema migrans (EM) rash in a patient with a prior history of early Lyme disease that was treated with antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>]. Reinfection has not been reported in patients who previously had Lyme arthritis, a late disease manifestation. Although antibody titers decline over time, this decline is unpredictable and some patients may continue to have positive anti-<em>B. burgdorferi</em> IgM and IgG antibody tests for years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Reinfection'</a>.)</p><p>In the rare case where there has been a documented decline in a serologic test, a subsequent increase (&gt;threefold) in antibody titer by ELISA in the setting of suspicious symptoms may herald a reinfection. However, in practical use, it is rare to have this information available and variability in titers during different runs even by the same laboratory makes interpretation of small differences in ELISA titer difficult. Repeated serologic testing to document decline of antibody titers is <strong>not</strong> recommended. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27411382\"><span class=\"h2\">New approaches to serodiagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Efforts to improve sensitivity and specificity of serologic testing for Lyme disease have resulted in proposals for new strategies for utilization of currently available tests.

IgG antibodies to the C6 invariant region develop early (within the first week), giving it comparable sensitivity to IgM ELISA tests with improved specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In a prospective study of 134 patients at various stages of Lyme disease, 89 patients with other illnesses, and 136 healthy controls, only 20 percent of patients with erythema migrans had positive results with either assay, but both assays had 100 percent sensitivity in patients with neurologic, cardiac, or joint manifestations of Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Specificity was 96 percent with the VlsE C6 peptide assay and 99 percent with two-tier serologic testing.</p><p>Another study assessed the sensitivity of a commercial VlsE C6 peptide ELISA in patients with erythema migrans, the initial skin lesion of Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The results were stratified based upon which of the three <em>B. burgdorferi</em> subtypes (defined by ribosomal spacer typing) caused infection. The VlsE C6 peptide ELISA had comparable sensitivity to two-tiered serologic testing in patients with <em>B. burgdorferi</em> subtype ribosomal spacer type (RST) 1 infections, and higher sensitivity in patients with either RST 2 or 3 infections compared with a two-tier approach.</p><p>The benefits of the VlsE C6 peptide ELISA compared with two-tier serologic testing are the relative ease of testing and result interpretation, the earlier development of the IgG response, and the ability to standardize results between laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/25,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,46</a>]. The major advantages of sonicate Western blot are its slightly greater specificity compared with the VlsE C6 peptide ELISA, and the fact that the degree of expansion of the antibody response to include greater numbers of positive bands gives information about the duration of infection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H760885913\"><span class=\"h3\">Modified two-tiered algorithms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Western blot testing can be difficult to perform and interpret, and the IgM Western blot, which requires only two of three particular bands, may represent a false-positive result (see <a href=\"#H477890409\" class=\"local\">'Testing algorithm'</a> above). Thus, modified two-tiered algorithms that use different second step tests for validating positive enzyme immunoassay testing have been developed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H794488243\"><span class=\"h4\">Algorithms using two enzyme immunoassays</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>VlsE C6 ELISA to replace Western blot </strong>&mdash; One strategy uses a whole cell-based ELISA followed by a C6 ELISA. However, clinical laboratories are not generally using this approach because the two enzyme immunoassays have been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only for use as first-tier assays and have not been FDA-cleared for sequential use in replacing Western blots. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This algorithm has been evaluated in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. In one, serum samples were tested with the traditional ELISA followed by the VlsE C6 ELISA, the VlsE C6 ELISA alone, or the traditional ELISA followed by Western blot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In patients with early Lyme disease, ELISA followed by VlsE C6 ELISA had a similar sensitivity as VlsE C6 ELISA alone (61 versus 64 percent), and both strategies had a higher sensitivity than ELISA followed by Western blot (48 percent). In patients with late Lyme disease, all three approaches had 100 percent sensitivity. The specificity of ELISA followed by VlsE C6 ELISA was equivalent to that of ELISA followed by Western blot (99.5 percent for each), and both two-tier strategies were more specific than VlsE C6 ELISA alone (98.4 percent). The positive predictive value of the ELISA followed by the VlsE C6 ELISA was 70 percent, compared with 66 percent for traditional two-tier testing and 43 percent for the VlsE C6 ELISA alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One limitation to this algorithm compared with traditional testing is that both the whole cell-based ELISA and the C6 ELISA can be positive for patients infected with <em>B. miyamotoi.</em> This is in contrast to Western blot testing for <em>B. burgdorferi</em>, which is negative for patients with <em>B. miyamotoi</em>. Thus, this algorithm can result in a decrease in specificity if used in an area where the incidence of <em>B. miyamotoi</em> is high. Despite this limitation, this algorithm still has utility in the clinical setting as both diseases are treated with the same antibiotics. A more detailed discussion of <em>B. miyamotoi</em> is found elsewhere.

One study evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of three different modified algorithms using serum from 55 patients with erythema migrans, 50 patients with other illnesses, and 1227 healthy subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The three different algorithms included a traditional whole cell-based ELISA followed by a C6 ELISA, a traditional whole cell-based ELISA followed by a VlsE chemiluminescence immunoassay, and a VlsE chemiluminescence immunoassay followed by a C6 ELISA. Although all three of these algorithms had somewhat increased sensitivity compared with the traditional Western blot, there was a significant increase in sensitivity when the VlsE chemiluminescence immunoassay was used as the first-tier test, and a C6 ELISA as the second-tier test (54 versus 25 percent with the traditional two-tiered approach). Of the modified algorithms evaluated in this study, the whole cell-based ELISA followed by the C6 ELISA (described in more detail above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>], is most likely to be available in clinical laboratories.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H185419008\"><span class=\"h4\">Addition of a VlsE C6 antigen band to the Western blot of traditional two-tier testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Replacement of the traditional three antigen IgM Western blot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50882\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50882 \">table 4</a>) with a single band Western blot using the C6 peptide antigen has been studied for patients with early Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Testing of serum from patients with early stage disease with a traditional <span class=\"nowrap\">IgM/IgG</span> combined ELISA followed by confirmation by a single band IgG C6 Western blot resulted in equivalent sensitivity (34 versus 31 percent), but much greater specificity (96 versus 63 percent) compared with the use of a three band IgM Western blot for confirmation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-lyme-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. For patients with later stage disease, for which IgM testing is not recommended, addition of the C6 antigen band to the traditional 10 antigen IgG Western blot resulted in improved sensitivity of two-tier testing in patients with acute carditis or neuritis using a criteria of 5 out of 11 bands positive (96 versus 63 percent for the traditional 10 antigen Western blot with a cutoff of 5 out of 10 bands positive). Specificity was equivalent using both approaches. In very late-stage disease, both the sensitivity and specificity of both the traditional Western blot and the Western blot with the addition of the VlsE C6 antigen was 100 percent.

The patient with a characteristic EM lesion will likely be seronegative, since the lesion appears prior to development of a diagnostic, adaptive immune response. Laboratory testing is neither required nor recommended. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast to the negative serology at the time of the appearance of the EM lesion, by the time the patient has findings of early disseminated extracutaneous disease (eg, lymphocytic meningitis, facial palsy, radiculoneuropathy, carditis with heart block), serologic tests are typically positive, as they are in patients with late Lyme disease. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serologic testing should be performed in patients who meet <strong>all</strong> of the following criteria:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A recent history of having resided in or traveled to an area endemic for Lyme disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><strong>and</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A risk factor for exposure to ticks</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><strong>and</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Symptoms consistent with early disseminated disease or late Lyme disease (eg, meningitis, radiculopathy, mononeuritis, cranial nerve palsy, arthritis, carditis) (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Indications for serologic testing'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serologic testing for Lyme disease should <strong>not</strong> be performed in the following settings:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with an EM rash. Patients with skin rashes consistent with EM who reside in or have recently traveled to an endemic area should be treated for Lyme disease.

The use of serologic testing in populations with a low pre-test probability of Lyme disease results in a greater likelihood of false-positive test results than true positive test results. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Indications for serologic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A skin lesion similar to EM can be seen in Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI); however, the geographic distribution of Lyme disease and STARI are usually different (exceptions are Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey). (See <a href=\"#H43075452\" class=\"local\">'Distinction from STARI'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When serologic testing is indicated, two-tier testing is recommended. The traditional approach uses an whole cell-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) followed by a Western blot as the tests of choice. However, Western blot testing can be difficult to perform and interpret; thus, alternative algorithms that eliminate the need for Western blot testing are being tested (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Serologic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine follow-up serologic testing is <strong>not</strong> recommended in assessing the patient who is cured or slowly improving.

However, a positive PCR result by itself is likely to be a false-positive result, and a positive result does not prove that the patient has active infection, since spirochetal DNA may persist long after spirochetal killing has occurred. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Polymerase chain reaction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of laboratory tests other than those described above (ELISA, Western blot, and in limited cases, PCR), to support a diagnosis of Lyme disease is <strong>not</strong> recommended.
