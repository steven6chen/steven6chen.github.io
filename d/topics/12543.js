Deficient mineralization can result in rickets <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> osteomalacia. Rickets refers to deficient mineralization at the growth plate, as well as architectural disruption of this structure. Osteomalacia refers to impaired mineralization of the bone matrix. Rickets and osteomalacia usually occur together as long as the growth plates are open; only osteomalacia occurs after the growth plates have fused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rickets-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-osteomalacia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of osteomalacia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mineralization defects are classified according to the predominant mineral deficiency. Calcipenic rickets is caused by calcium deficiency, which usually is due to insufficient intake or metabolism of vitamin D, and in some cases insufficient intake or absorption of calcium in the setting of normal vitamin D levels. Phosphopenic rickets usually is caused by renal phosphate wasting. Calcipenic rickets is often but not always associated with low serum calcium levels, while phosphopenic rickets is characterized by low serum levels of phosphorus. </p><p>An overview of the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and the differential diagnosis of rickets is presented here. The etiology and treatment of calcipenic and phosphopenic rickets are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-treatment-of-calcipenic-rickets-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and treatment of calcipenic rickets in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets and tumor-induced osteomalacia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Growth plate thickness is determined by two opposing processes: chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy on the one hand, and vascular invasion of the growth plate followed by conversion into primary bone spongiosa on the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rickets-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Vascular invasion requires mineralization of the growth plate cartilage and is delayed or prevented by deficiency of calcium or phosphorus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rickets-in-children/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. In these circumstances, growth plate cartilage accumulates and the growth plate thickens. In addition, the chondrocytes of the growth plate become disorganized, losing their columnar orientation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rickets-in-children/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>] with characteristic expansion of the hypertrophic zone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rickets-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In the bone tissue below the growth plate (metaphysis), the mineralization defect leads to the accumulation of osteoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rickets-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>These abnormalities alter the overall geometry of the involved skeletal sites, leading to secondary increases in the diameters of the growth plate and metaphysis. These changes may be regarded as an attempt to compensate for decreased bone strength by increased bone size. Nonetheless, bone stability is compromised and, if the underlying condition does not improve, bowing occurs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcipenic and phosphopenic rickets initially manifest at the distal forearm, knee, and costochondral junctions.

Thus, deformities of the forearms and posterior bowing of the distal tibia are more common in infants, whereas an exaggeration of the normal physiological bowing of the legs (genu varum) is a characteristic finding in the toddler who has started to walk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53635\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53635 \">image 2</a>). In the older child, valgus deformities of the legs or a windswept deformity (valgus deformity of one leg and varus deformity of the other) may be apparent. The type of deformity depends upon the biomechanical forces acting on the lower extremities at the time when the structural weakness develops.

As the disease progresses, disorganization of the growth plate becomes more apparent with cupping, splaying, formation of cortical spurs, and stippling. The appearance of the epiphyseal bone centers may be delayed, or they may be small, osteopenic, and ill-defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rickets-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The shafts of the long bones are osteopenic, and the cortices may become thin. The trabecular pattern is reduced and becomes coarse. Deformities of the shafts of the long bones typically are present and, in severe rickets, pathological fractures and Looser's zones (also known as Milkman pseudofractures) may be noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rickets-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Looser's zones are pseudofractures, fissures, or narrow radiolucent lines 2 to 5 mm in width with sclerotic borders, and are a characteristic radiologic finding in osteomalacia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52768\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52768 \">image 4</a>). They often are bilateral and symmetric, and lie perpendicular to the cortical margins of bones. They usually are found at the femoral neck, on the medial part of the femoral shaft, immediately under the lesser trochanter or a few centimeters beneath, or on the pubic and ischial rami. They also may occur in the ulna, scapula, clavicle, rib, and metatarsal bones. Pseudofractures also can be seen as hot spots on bone scans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rickets-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Extraskeletal findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extraskeletal manifestations of rickets vary depending upon the primary mineral deficiency. Hypoplasia of the dental enamel is a typical finding of calcipenic rickets, whereas dental abscesses occur more often in heritable forms of phosphopenic rickets. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-defects-of-the-teeth#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental defects of the teeth&quot;, section on 'Enamel defects'</a>.)</p><p>Calcipenic rickets can affect the musculoskeletal system with decreased muscle tone, leading to the delayed achievement of motor milestones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rickets-in-children/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Presentation with hypocalcemic seizures is frequent in the first year of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rickets-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Children with calcipenic rickets also are particularly prone to acquiring infectious diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rickets-in-children/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Increased sweating is a common finding in young infants with calcipenic rickets and may be caused by bone pain.

Alkaline phosphatase participates in the mineralization of bone and growth plate cartilage, and is an excellent marker of disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rickets-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In the heritable forms of phosphopenic rickets, the serum alkaline phosphatase activity tends to be moderately elevated (400 to 800 international units per liter <span class=\"nowrap\">[IU/L])</span> whereas in calcipenic rickets, values often reach greater levels (often up to 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L)</span>. </p><p>Other biochemical findings vary depending upon the type of rickets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81032\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81032 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rickets-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Serum phosphorus concentrations usually are low in both calcipenic and phosphopenic rickets. The serum calcium concentration may be either decreased or normal in calcipenic rickets, depending on the stage of rickets; serum calcium usually is normal in phosphopenic rickets. The tubular reabsorption of phosphorus (TRP) and the maximal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus per glomerular filtration rate <span class=\"nowrap\">(TmP/GFR)</span> usually are decreased in both types of rickets, but are more pronounced in renal phosphate wasting types. By contrast, these values are quite elevated in the setting of nutritional phosphate deprivation. </p><p>The serum concentration of parathyroid hormone (PTH) typically is quite elevated in calcipenic rickets. In contrast, PTH concentrations are usually normal or modestly elevated in phosphopenic rickets. Serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) reflect the amount of vitamin D stored in the body and, consequently, are low in vitamin D deficiency. Serum concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]<sub>2</sub>D) can be low, normal, or increased in calcipenic rickets. In some forms of phosphopenic rickets (X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets [XLH], tumor-induced osteomalacia [TIO]), serum concentrations of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D may be low or inappropriately normal (in view of the ambient hypophosphatemia, which should serve to increase production of the metabolite). In other forms of phosphopenic rickets (hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria [HHRH]), the serum concentration of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D may be elevated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of a child with clinical signs of rickets should include a dietary history with particular attention given to calcium and vitamin D intake along with a medication history, and a history of sun exposure. Radiographic evaluation of a child with rickets should include, at a minimum, plain films of the wrist and hand or knees to evaluate the epiphyseal plates. (See <a href=\"#H2256742\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1640853\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), inorganic phosphorus (Pi) and calcium concentrations are used to determine the initial classification of rickets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79880\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef79880 \">algorithm 1</a>). Rickets is an unlikely diagnosis if all of these values are normal. Serum creatinine and liver enzymes should be measured to screen for renal and liver disease, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H1640164\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Calcipenic rickets</strong> &ndash; If the serum PTH is considerably elevated and phosphorus concentration is normal or low, then a provisional diagnosis of calcipenic rickets can be made. Serum calcium may be normal in calcipenic rickets, or may be low in advanced disease. The diagnosis is confirmed if appropriate healing is observed on X-ray during the course of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Calcipenic rickets'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Phosphopenic rickets</strong> &ndash; If the serum PTH is normal or mildly elevated and the phosphorus concentration is low, then phosphopenic rickets should be suspected. Demonstration of renal phosphate wasting will identify most forms of phosphopenic rickets, but in cases of inadequate supply of dietary phosphorus (albeit an uncommon event), enhanced renal conservation of phosphate will be evident. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Phosphopenic rickets'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Further evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of rickets include conditions that lead to hypocalcemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypophosphatemia as a result of decreased intake, malabsorption, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased excretion of calcium, phosphate, or vitamin D&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67378\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67378 \">table 2</a>). To determine the optimal treatment, the common nutritional causes of rickets must be distinguished from the forms caused by a gastrointestinal or renal disease or an inherited disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Calcipenic rickets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of acquired rickets are calcipenic. If the serum phosphorus concentration is low but PTH is considerably elevated, then a provisional diagnosis of calcipenic rickets can be made. Elevated PTH levels are occasionally observed at diagnosis in X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), the most frequently encountered form of phosphopenic rickets. Therefore, if calcipenic rickets is provisionally diagnosed, it is important to observe appropriate healing during the course of therapy and, in the event of treatment failure, an alternate diagnosis should be considered.</p><p>Calcipenic rickets can be further divided into the following disorders, which can be distinguished by measuring serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]<sub>2</sub>D) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80602\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef80602 \">algorithm 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81032\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81032 \">table 1</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutritional rickets &ndash; Calcipenic rickets is usually caused by dietary deficiency of vitamin D. Occasionally, nutritional rickets is caused by deficiency of dietary calcium or a mixed deficiency of vitamin D and calcium. 25OHD levels are typically low, but they may be normal if there is associated calcium deficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>25-hydroxylase deficiency &ndash; Mutations in the enzyme that converts vitamin D to the major circulating vitamin D metabolite, 25OHD, can result in limited biosynthesis of 25OHD and subsequent rickets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rickets-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This disorder is exceedingly rare, and may be suspected when pharmacologic doses of vitamin D used in the treatment of rickets do not result in appropriate correction of the serum level of 25OHD. The differential diagnosis includes poor compliance with medication or fat malabsorption.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency &ndash; 1-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency (previously known as vitamin D-dependent rickets type I), is also known as pseudovitamin D deficiency because its clinical manifestations mimic those of vitamin D deficiency. This is a rare disorder caused by a defect in the vitamin D 1-alpha hydroxylase enzyme that converts 25OHD into the active metabolite 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D. Serum levels of 25OHD are normal and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D levels are low.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hereditary resistance to vitamin D &ndash; Hereditary resistance to vitamin D (previously known as vitamin D-dependent rickets type II), is a rare form of calcipenic rickets caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes the vitamin D receptor, leading to vitamin D resistance. 25OHD levels are normal and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D levels are high or very high.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary defects in vitamin D metabolism or absorption of calcium or vitamin D &ndash; This can occur in extremely severe liver disease or in intestinal disorders such as celiac disease. </p><p/><p>The diagnosis and management of each of these disorders are discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-treatment-of-calcipenic-rickets-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and treatment of calcipenic rickets in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Phosphopenic rickets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phosphopenic rickets is characterized by low serum phosphorus with normal PTH concentrations. Phosphopenic rickets in children and adolescents is almost always caused by renal phosphate wasting, which may be isolated or part of a generalized renal tubular disorder. When phosphopenic rickets is suspected, it is important to establish whether renal phosphate wasting is present. This is done by performing a fasting urine collection (usually for two hours) and obtaining a blood sample during the course of the urine collection for determination of the total reabsorption of phosphorus (TRP) and maximal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus per glomerular filtration rate <span class=\"nowrap\">(TmP/GFR)</span>. The finding of very low <span class=\"nowrap\">TmP/GFR</span> confirms renal phosphate wasting. In contrast, very high TRP and <span class=\"nowrap\">TmP/GFR</span> indicate renal conservation of phosphate, implicating compromised dietary supply or intestinal absorption. Of note, phosphate deficiency has been described in a case series of young children with complex disease who were fed Neocate brand formula (an elemental formula designed for children with multiple food allergies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rickets-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. We hypothesize that the phosphate in this formula has limited bioavailability compared with standard formulas. </p><p>The different causes of phosphate wasting can be distinguished by measuring urinary amino acids, bicarbonate, glucose, and calcium concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59221\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59221 \">algorithm 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81032\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81032 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal tubular disorders &ndash; Renal tubular disorders such as Fanconi syndrome can cause rickets due to renal loss of phosphate. Fanconi syndrome is characterized by hypophosphatemia due to phosphaturia, renal glucosuria (glucosuria with a normal plasma glucose concentration), aminoaciduria, tubular proteinuria, and proximal renal tubular acidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-renal-tubular-acidosis-in-infants-and-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and clinical manifestations of renal tubular acidosis in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Fanconi syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets &ndash; X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH) is the most common cause of isolated renal phosphate loss. It is a heritable disorder, caused by mutations in the <strong>Ph</strong>osphate regulating <strong>E</strong>ndopeptidase on the <strong>X</strong> chromosome (PHEX) gene. Renal phosphate wasting is present from birth, but the disorder tends to become clinically apparent when the child begins to walk, causing bowing of the legs. Less common autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of hypophosphatemic rickets also exist. Although XLH is the prototypical form of FGF23-mediated renal phosphate loss, autosomal dominant and recessive forms of heritable phosphate-wasting rickets due to FGF23 overproduction occur, with far less frequency than XLH.

It is an acquired disorder associated with a tumor, which usually is benign. These tumors express a variety of factors, one of which, FGF23, acts at the kidney to induce renal phosphate wasting. Complete removal of the tumor will remove the source of FGF23, thereby curing the disorder. TIO tends to present in late childhood or adolescence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets and tumor-induced osteomalacia&quot;, section on 'Tumor-induced osteomalacia'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other causes of excess FGF23 production &ndash; In addition to XLH and other forms of familial FGF23-mediated hypophosphatemia, related phenotypes of FGF23 mediated renal phosphate loss and rachitic bone disease may be observed in other conditions, which generally occur in sporadic fashion. These disorders include epidermal nevus syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rickets-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] and fibrous dysplasia of bone as occurs in the McCune-Albright syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rickets-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria &ndash; Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH) is an autosomal recessive disease, and is another rare cause of phosphopenic rickets. This disorder is distinguished from the other forms of hypophosphatemic rickets by an elevated serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D concentration and increased urinary calcium excretion. This occurs because HHRH is not an FGF23-mediated form of hypophosphatemia. Because the treatment for this disorder is distinct, it is important to evaluate for HHRH in every patient with phosphopenic rickets before initiating therapy, by measuring serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D and urinary calcium excretion. The disorder is due to loss of function mutations in Na-Pi IIc, a sodium-phosphate transporter expressed in renal tubules.

In children with suspected rickets, renal function should be evaluated by measuring serum creatinine. Bone disease occurs in children with renal insufficiency for many reasons, including reduced formation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]<sub>2</sub>D), metabolic acidosis, administration of aluminum, and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

The radiographic features can be similar to those of rickets. However, serum inorganic phosphorus and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations usually are normal in children with skeletal dysplasia.

The possibility of liver disease can be evaluated by measuring liver enzymes (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT]).

Like rickets, it is characterized by bone demineralization. In contrast to rickets, serum alkaline phosphatase activity is very low.

Osteomalacia refers to impaired mineralization of bone and usually occurs together with rickets. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rickets is classified according to the predominant mineral deficiency. Calcipenic rickets is caused by calcium deficiency, which usually is due to insufficient intake of or metabolism of vitamin D, and in some cases insufficient intake or absorption of calcium in the setting of normal vitamin D levels. Phosphopenic rickets usually is caused by renal phosphate wasting. Serum calcium levels are often, but not always, decreased in calcipenic rickets. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Calcipenic rickets usually is caused by dietary deficiency of vitamin D <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> calcium; this is the most common cause of rickets worldwide. Rarely, it is caused by genetic defects in vitamin D metabolism or action leading to vitamin D resistance. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Calcipenic rickets'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Phosphopenic rickets in children and adolescents is almost always caused by renal phosphate wasting, which is usually an isolated phenomenon, but may be part of a generalized tubular disorder such as Fanconi syndrome, or may rarely result from inadequate dietary phosphorus or intestinal malabsorption. Renal phosphate wasting syndromes can be FGF23-mediated or occur independent of FGF23 excess. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Phosphopenic rickets'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The skeletal findings are similar for calcipenic and phosphopenic rickets, and may include delayed closure of the fontanelles, parietal and frontal bossing, enlargement of the costochondral junction (&quot;rachitic rosary&quot;), widening of the wrist, and lateral bowing of the femur and tibia (bow legs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66400\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66400 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Skeletal findings'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiographic findings of rickets include widening of the epiphyseal plate and loss of definition of the zone of provisional calcification at the <span class=\"nowrap\">epiphyseal/metaphyseal</span> interface, progressing to disorganization of the growth plate with cupping, splaying, and formation of cortical spurs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F80989\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80989 \">image 3</a>). The changes are best seen in the distal ulna and the metaphyses above and below the knee. (See <a href=\"#H2256742\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The concentration of serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated in both types of rickets, and it is a good marker of disease activity. Other biochemical findings include hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia, but the pattern varies depending on the type and severity of the rickets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81032\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81032 \">table 1</a>). Serum concentration of parathyroid hormone (PTH) typically is quite elevated in calcipenic rickets, but not in phosphopenic rickets. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurements of serum PTH and inorganic phosphorus serve to distinguish calcipenic from phosphopenic rickets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79880\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef79880 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1640853\" class=\"local\">'Initial classification'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For children with calcipenic rickets, measurements of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) help to distinguish rickets caused by vitamin D deficiency (the most common form) from other causes of calcipenic rickets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80602\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef80602 \">algorithm 2</a>).

Causes of renal phosphate wasting can be further distinguished by measuring serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and urinary excretion of amino acids, bicarbonate, glucose, and calcium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59221\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59221 \">algorithm 3</a>). Use of an elemental infant formula (specifically Neocate brand) has also been associated with phosphopenic rickets, due to phosphate malabsorption.
