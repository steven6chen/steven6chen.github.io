The three major categories of indication are prolonged second stage of labor, nonreassuring fetal status, and maternal cardiac or neurological disease, but there is no absolute indication. The indications and prerequisites for operative vaginal delivery are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=operative-vaginal-delivery#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Operative vaginal delivery&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=operative-vaginal-delivery#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Operative vaginal delivery&quot;, section on 'Prerequisites'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suspected fetal-pelvic disproportion is a contraindication to any instrumental vaginal delivery.</p><p>Historically, experts have recommended avoiding use of vacuum devices to assist delivery before 34 weeks of gestation due to a perceived increased risk of birth injuries in preterm infants. In a registry review of 40,764 preterm births in Sweden, 3.3 percent of preterm births &lt;34 weeks of gestation were delivered by vacuum extraction despite this recommendation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Intracranial hemorrhage was more common before 34 weeks. While these data were gathered retrospectively and confounded by indication, avoiding vacuum extraction in pregnancies less than 34 weeks is a prudent approach.</p><p>Prior scalp sampling or multiple attempts at fetal scalp electrode placement are relative contraindications to vacuum extraction because theoretically these procedures may increase the risk of cephalohematoma or external bleeding from the scalp wound.</p><p>Known fetal demineralization diseases (eg, osteogenesis imperfecta), maternal Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], and fetal bleeding diatheses (eg, thrombocytopenia or hemophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]) are generally accepted contraindications to operative vaginal delivery because of perceived increased risks of fetal or maternal trauma, but both the absolute and relative risks are poorly defined. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of vacuum versus forceps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=operative-vaginal-delivery#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Operative vaginal delivery&quot;, section on 'Choice of instrument'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INSTRUMENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Instrumentation consists of a vacuum pump, a cup to attach to the fetal head, and some type of handle attached to the cup which is pulled to generate traction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55535\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55535 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Vacuum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suction can be generated manually or with an electrical suction device.</p><p>The Kiwi vacuum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59015\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59015 \">picture 2</a>) and the Mystic vacuum both come with a pump integrated into the handle of the device so the operator controls the vacuum without need for an assistant. A version of theKiwi disposable device also comes with a traction force indicator, allowing the operator to compare tactile impression with an objective measure of force.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Extractor cup</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vacuum cups may be soft (pliable) or rigid and the shape may be bell or &quot;M&quot; shaped (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79829\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79829 \">picture 3</a>). Rigid cups were initially made of metal, but these have been almost completely replaced by rigid plastic, polyurethane, or polyethylene cups. Soft cups are made of plastic, silicone, rubber, or polyethylene. Sizes vary somewhat by manufacturer; any standard cup size may be used for any fetus meeting criteria for vacuum assisted delivery (eg, &ge;34 weeks of gestation).</p><p>The optimum type of cup has not been determined. Two randomized trials comparing a &quot;standard vacuum cup&quot; to the newer rigid plastic Kiwi Omnicup found that the latter was less effective because of more frequent detachments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The failure rates for the Kiwi Omnicup versus conventional cups were 30 to 34 percent and 19 to 21 percent, respectively. Of note, in both trials, the &quot;standard vacuum cup&quot; was actually any one of a variety of vacuum devices that were already in use at the trial hospitals, and participating obstetricians were allowed to choose their favorite device when not randomized to the newer Kiwi Omnicup. In a subsequent trial that randomized 164 women to either a Kiwi Omnicup or Malmstr&ouml;m metal cup, no differences were seen in delivery success rates and the Kiwi group had a statistically significant reduction in subaponeurotic hemorrhage (1.2 versus 10.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Soft versus rigid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The performance characteristics of soft versus rigid cups have been examined in numerous trials. A Cochrane analysis of data from nine trials including 1375 women concluded that soft cups were more likely to fail to achieve vaginal delivery (failure rate 14.8 versus 9.5 percent, odds ratio [OR] 1.65, 95% CI 1.19-2.29), but were associated with less scalp injury than rigid cups (13 versus 24 percent, OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.15-0.60) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of maternal injury.</p><p>Rigid cups tended to be more suitable for occiput posterior, occiput transverse, and difficult occiput anterior position deliveries given their ability to stay attached despite strong traction, while soft cups appeared to be more appropriate for uncomplicated occiput anterior extractions where less traction is needed and thus the excess risk of scalp injury could be avoided. Most failures were due to cup detachment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Bell versus mushroom shape</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Soft cups are usually bell shaped, while rigid cups tend to be mushroom shaped (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79829\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79829 \">picture 3</a>). Conclusive studies comparing the performance characteristics of bell-shaped cups versus the Malmstr&ouml;m mushroom or &quot;M&quot; style cups have not been performed. In terms of pure traction force, laboratory studies have demonstrated that bell shaped cups generate significantly less traction force than M-style cups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This difference may be the result of the interaction between the cup's edges and the scalp chignon that is formed. Bell-shaped cups tend to draw the chignon into the cup, thereby reducing the available vacuum area and leading to a decrease in cup adhesiveness at the edges. This allows leakage of air and eventual detachments. M-style cups, on the other hand, have a mushroom-shaped design which tends to draw the chignon into the cup while the edges interlock with the base of the chignon, thereby creating a mechanical attachment that seems to compensate for the loss of available vacuum space. These theories have been supported by small clinical trials, although none have definitively answered the question of which cup is superior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Occiput posterior position</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the flexion point on occiput posterior presentations is positioned more posterior and higher in the vagina than with occiput anterior presentations, certain adjustments must be employed. Specifically, the cup needs to be placed much deeper in the posterior vagina. This accommodation usually necessitates a vacuum device with a discoid, rather than a bell-shaped, cup and a nonfixed traction cord rather than a firm stem. To meet these needs, special cups have been designed for occiput posterior presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52265\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52265 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Handle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most plastic bell shaped cups have a relatively rigid rod connecting the handle and cup. This impedes accurate placement of the instrument on deflexed or posterior heads. Higher success rates in these malpresentations may be achieved with rigid, plastic &quot;M&quot; cups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52265\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52265 \">table 1</a>), one of which (discussed above) consists of a rigid plastic Malmstr&ouml;m-type cup attached by a wire to a unique combined <span class=\"nowrap\">handle/vacuum</span> pump (Kiwi Omnicup (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59015\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59015 \">picture 2</a>)).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician must know the indications and contraindications to vacuum assisted delivery and have expertise in proven techniques. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=operative-vaginal-delivery#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Operative vaginal delivery&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=operative-vaginal-delivery#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Operative vaginal delivery&quot;, section on 'Prerequisites'</a>.)</p><p>As with forceps, good placement of a vacuum cup requires proper assessment of the fetal position and station, with care taken to identify molding, caput, and asynclitism. In addition, the flexion point is a critical landmark for the safe and effective use of a vacuum. Practitioners need to keep in mind that the location of cup placement becomes the leading point of the fetal head. Unlike forceps, which will usually correct asynclitism after application, failure to place the cup over the flexion point impedes delivery, rather than assisting it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The woman's bladder should be empty (via voiding or catheterization). The patient is placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and the fetal presentation, position, and station are confirmed and documented. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not necessary. No benefit has been established, although data are sparse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3316522367\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adequate anesthesia can be obtained with neuraxial anesthesia and possibly with a local block. In emergency situations, neuraxial block may not be possible. In contrast to forceps, vacuum extraction can be performed without anesthesia if necessary, but the gravida will likely experience significant discomfort.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Determine the flexion point</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To effect most vaginal deliveries (whether spontaneous or assisted), the fetal head must rotate and flex at the neck to allow the passage of the widest diameter of the head through the pelvis. This pathway is optimized when the mentovertical diameter points in the direction of the delivering pathway.</p><p>The flexion point is the location on the fetal head where outward traction pulls the head so as to allow flexion at the neck while keeping the mentovertical diameter in the direction of the birth canal. In the normally molded fetal head, the flexion point is in the midline, over the sagittal suture, approximately 6 cm from the anterior fontanelle and 3 cm from the posterior fontanelle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69870\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69870 \">figure 1</a>). The center of the vacuum cup should be directly over the flexion point. Since most of the commonly used vacuum cups have a diameter between 50 and 70 mm, when the center of the cup is placed over the flexion point, the edges of the cup should be approximately 3 cm from the anterior fontanelle and just at the edge of the posterior fontanelle. The anterior fontanelle is the reference point for checking the application because access to the posterior fontanelle is partially blocked once the extractor cup is in place.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Place the cup</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The practitioner spreads the labia and introduces the bell shaped cup by compressing and inserting it into the vagina while angling the device posteriorly. If an M-shaped or rigid cup is used, the device is flexed at the base of the shaft and inserted sideways into the vagina while angling posteriorly.</p><p>When contact is made with the fetal head, the center of the cup is placed over the flexion point and symmetrically across the sagittal suture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69870\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69870 \">figure 1</a>). The entire 360&deg; circumference of the cup must then be digitally inspected to insure that no vaginal, cervical, or vulvar tissues are trapped between the cup and the fetal surface, nor should the cup cover either fontanelle.</p><p>After correct placement of the cup is confirmed, vacuum pressure should be raised to 100 to 150 mmHg to maintain the cup's position. The edges of the cup should again be swept with a finger to insure that no maternal tissues are entrapped. The vacuum cup is now properly in place and the higher suction pressures required for traction can be administered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Apply suction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suction pressure is measured in various units: 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/cm2</span> of atmospheric pressure = 600 mmHg = 23.6 inches of Hg = 11.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">lb/in(2)</span>.</p><p>Vacuum suction pressures of 500 to 600 mmHg have been recommended during traction, although pressures in excess of 450 mmHg are rarely necessary (green zone) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57936\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57936 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. While lower suction pressures increase the risk of cup &quot;pop-offs,&quot; pressures beyond 600 mmHg increase the risks of fetal scalp trauma and cerebral, cranial and scalp hemorrhage.</p><p>Rapid application of negative pressure is recommended. Although a slow, stepwise increase in vacuum pressure over 8 to 10 minutes was initially practiced, randomized trials have demonstrated that rapid application of negative pressure over 1 to 2 minutes reduced the duration of the procedure without compromising effectiveness or safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>The clinician also needs to keep in mind that cup sizes vary among different manufacturers' devices and that cup size affects the overall traction force applied since force = (area under the cup)(suction). Therefore, as the size of the cup increases, the total force applied will rise even with the same amount of applied suction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. As an example, with 600 mmHg of suction, a 50 mm cup will generate 15.7 kg of traction force while a 60 mm cup will generate 22.6 kg of traction force. Whether the greater traction forces associated with larger cup sizes are associated with higher vaginal delivery rates or more fetal morbidity is unclear.</p><p>Finally, the notion that the vacuum is &quot;designed to pop-off before damage occurs&quot; is erroneous and should not be considered a safety mechanism. The maximum suction pressure should not exceed 600 mmHg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Exert traction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The absolute &quot;safe&quot; traction force for vacuum extraction is unknown. In 1962, one group determined a total traction force of 17.6 kg was typically necessary to affect delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Other authors subsequently determined the traction force to be lower, approximately 12 kg in multiparas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. An observational study of 560 vacuum assisted deliveries using an omnicup vacuum device with a traction force indicator found that 86 percent of extractions occurred with 11.5 kg (25 lbs) or less traction and 14 percent with greater than 11.5 kg traction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>However, since traction force needs to be individually calculated and will vary with cup size, suction pressure, and altitude, it is reasonable and practical to rely solely on the suction pressure, which is displayed on all commercially available devices.</p><p>During an instrumental delivery, practitioners assist by adding to the momentum of the maternal expulsive efforts (unless Valsalva is contraindicated) rather than pulling the baby out independently. As soon as a contraction starts and the mother begins pushing, the vacuum suction pressure is rapidly raised to 500 to 600 mmHg (green zone on the vacuum indicator gauge).</p><p>Traction is applied gradually as the contraction builds and is maintained for the duration of the contraction, but only in coordination with the mother's pushing (the number of pulls depends on the number of pushes; there is one &quot;set of pulls&quot; per contraction). Both hands are employed, and work in tandem. The fingertips of the dominant hand pull the device's crossbar, while the nondominant hand monitors the progress of descent and prevents cup detachment by placing counter pressure with the thumb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. During the extraction, the stem of the device is kept perpendicular to the plane of the cup to maintain the seal with the fetal head. The device is more likely to detach if angular traction is applied or with pendulum or rocking motions. Jerking the device will lead to unnecessary pop-offs.</p><p>Traction is applied along the axis of the pelvic curve to guide the fetal vertex, led by the flexion point, through the birth canal. Initially, the angle of traction is downward (toward the floor); the higher the beginning station, the steeper the angle of downward traction required. The axis of traction is then extended upwards to a 45 degree angle to the floor as the head emerges from the pelvis and crowns. In addition, the handle of the device is allowed to passively turn as the head auto-rotates through its descent. The handle should never be actively twisted to rotate the head. This dangerous maneuver can cause &quot;cookie cutter&quot; injuries to the fetal scalp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Traction is gradually discontinued as the contraction ends or the mother stops pushing. Between contractions, suction pressure can be fully maintained or reduced to &lt;200 mmHg; it is well established that fetal morbidity is similar for both regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Descent should occur with each application of traction, beginning with the first. When the head is delivered, the suction is released, the cup is removed, and the remainder of the delivery proceeds as usual. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of normal labor and delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Routine episiotomy is not necessary for an assisted vaginal birth and may increase the risk of significant perineal trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In a series of 1000 consecutive omnicup-assisted deliveries, the incidence of third and fourth degree tears with versus without an episiotomy was 15.8 and 5.8 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, the type of episiotomy was not specified. In observational studies, mediolateral or lateral episiotomy reduced the risk of obstetric anal sphincter injury in vacuum-assisted deliveries in primiparous women (odds ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.37-0.77) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Rotations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of the fetus in posterior or transverse position may involve expectant management, manual rotation, instrumental delivery, or cesarean.

The handle should never be actively twisted to rotate the head.

A maximum of two to three cup detachments, three sets of pulls for the descent phase, three sets of pulls for the outlet extraction phase, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a maximum total vacuum application time of 15 to 30 minutes are commonly recommended, with most authors advising lesser time limits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/23,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,30,31</a>]. These recommendations are based more upon common sense and experience than scientific data, as observational series have shown no long-term differences in neonatal outcome related to these variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Nevertheless, the majority of successful vacuum assisted deliveries will be achieved within the parameters described above, and thus justify their use. As an example, a series including 1000 consecutive attempted omnicup-assisted deliveries reported &le;3 pop-offs in 99.9 percent of cases, use of &le;5 pulls in 98.7 percent of cases, and duration of cup application &le;10 minutes in 97.4 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Although several studies have demonstrated a relationship between duration of cup application and development of cephalohematoma, the major morbidity of these lesions was largely cosmetic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">DOCUMENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Documentation should include the indication for the procedure, fetal status (station, position, estimated fetal weight, interpretation of the fetal heart rate tracing), a record of the discussion with the patient, and a detailed description of the procedure itself (type of anesthesia, type of vacuum cup, total time of vacuum application and whether vacuum was reduced between contractions, maximum vacuum achieved, number of pulls and contractions, number of detachments, description of progress with each pull, whether or not an episiotomy was performed or lacerations occurred). It is also worth documenting that the prerequisites for vacuum delivery were met: cervix fully dilated, maternal bladder empty, and no known fetal contraindications were present (eg, the gestational age was &ge;34 weeks, no known fetal bleeding diathesis, etc) and the method used for determining station (+2 of 3 or +2 of 5).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">FAILED PROCEDURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H511415960\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a retrospective case-control study of 306 failed and 618 successful vacuum-assisted deliveries, predictors of a failed procedure included estimated fetal weight &ge;3750&nbsp;g as compared with &lt;3250&nbsp;g (OR 5.7), epidural analgesia (OR 3.0), occiput posterior position (OR 2.6), failure to progress as the indication (OR 1.7), labor augmentation (OR 1.4), and increasing gestational age (OR 1.2 per week) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Predictors of success included at least one previous vaginal birth (OR 0.32), lower station of the fetal head at start of the procedure (OR 0.31 per station more descended), and taller maternal height. </p><p>Using ultrasound to measure the distance from the presenting part of the fetal head to the maternal perineum, and then predicting vacuum delivery success based on this number is an investigational tool. Head-to-perineum distances &gt;35mm in one study and &gt;40mm in another study, which correlated with +2 station, were associated with higher vacuum failure rates and more difficult extractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H575395217\"><span class=\"h2\">Causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reasons for failure with vacuum assisted deliveries are multifactorial. The key with an unsuccessful operative procedure is to review the events step-by-step to identify areas for future technique alternations or decision changes.</p><p>Some reasons for failure include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetopelvic disproportion (eg, non- occipitoanterior position, macrosomia, uterine constriction ring) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incorrect technique &ndash; Pulling the stem too quickly or when maternal expulsive efforts are weak will lead to cup detachments. Moreover, upwards traction before the head is crowning will tend to disrupt the vacuum seal and lead to pop-offs. Incorrect cup size also increases the risk of failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paramedian or deflexing applications &ndash; It is essential to identify the flexion point and focus the vacuum traction to leading the mentovertical diameter through the pelvis. Off-midline applications or deflexing applications will pull less favorable diameters of the fetal head through the pelvis and inhibit, rather than assist, delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large caput succedaneum &ndash; An increase in fetal scalp edema lets more of the scalp to be drawn into the cup, which reduces the available vacuum area, and, in turn, lessens total traction. The effect is more pronounced with bell-shaped cups than in M-style cups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and with soft cups compared with rigid cups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>Failure of an attempted vacuum assisted delivery increases the likelihood of neonatal morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]; the subsequent use of sequential forceps in this setting has been associated with an increased risk of neonatal intracranial hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] and is rarely indicated.

No studies have clearly demonstrated a benefit of one type of vacuum cup over another for preventing serious complications. Similarly, no threshold for duration of vacuum application or maximum number of pop-offs has been proven to prevent serious complications. &#160; &#160;</p><p>The following tips are useful for reducing the risk of complications:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Confirm correct cup placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A successful vacuum assisted delivery requires placement of the cup over the flexion point. Misalignment of the cup relative to the flexion point leads to cranial deflexion or asymmetry as traction is applied, which impedes, rather than assists, the delivery process because a larger cranial diameter is presented to the birth canal. Paramedian application is also associated with a higher rate of neonatal scalp trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>If the cup is dislodged, the scalp is examined to make sure there is no injury before reapplying the cup.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoid entrapping vaginal soft tissues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Entrapment of maternal tissues between the cup and the fetal head will cause vaginal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vulvar lacerations, which can be difficult to repair and cause unnecessary maternal blood loss and discomfort.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Know when to abandon the procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with any obstetric intervention, practitioners must be willing and able to abandon the procedure and proceed to cesarean delivery promptly when the vaginal delivery is not progressing normally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Although there is often a tendency to try to complete the delivery vaginally despite failed progress <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> multiple &quot;pop-offs,&quot; prudence dictates abdominal delivery when the fetus is not readily delivered with vacuum assistance. An indicated vaginal delivery that could not be completed with vacuum assistance is unlikely to progress to a spontaneous vaginal delivery with a little more time, and delay may increase the risk of neonatal or maternal morbidity.

A successful vacuum extraction is most likely to be achieved by accurate cup application, appropriate traction technique, a favorable flexed fetal cranial position and low station at the time of application, use of the most appropriate cup design, and absence of fetopelvic disproportion. In general:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The three major categories of indication are prolonged second stage of labor, nonreassuring fetal status, and maternal cardiac or neurological disease, but there is no absolute indication. In addition to the general contraindications to operative vaginal delivery, contraindications specific to vacuum extraction include gestational age less than 34 weeks and previous scalp sampling. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications and contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For occiput anterior deliveries requiring only mild traction, we suggest a soft bell-shaped vacuum cup rather than a rigid cup (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Soft cups result in less scalp injury, but also produce less traction. We use the rigid mushroom-style cup for deliveries likely to require greater traction forces. Cup options are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52265\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52265 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Extractor cup'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For occiput posterior deliveries, we use a rigid discoid cup without a rigid stem that was designed for this purpose. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Occiput posterior position'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cup should be applied at the flexion point and the edges swept with a finger to insure that no maternal tissues are entrapped. In the normally molded fetal head, the flexion point is in the midline, over the sagittal suture, approximately 6 cm from the anterior fontanelle and 3 cm from the posterior fontanelle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69870\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69870 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Determine the flexion point'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid application to the maximum suction pressure of 600 mmHg is acceptable, although pressures in excess of 450 mmHg are rarely necessary. Slow, stepwise application of suction does not improve safety or efficacy. Between contractions, suction pressure can be fully maintained or reduced to &lt;200 mmHg. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Apply suction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Exert traction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply gentle traction along the axis of the pelvic curve (ie, down then up) in concert with maternal pushing. The scalp can be damaged if the handle is actively twisted to rotate the head. A mnemonic is provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53086\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53086 \">table 3</a>) to assist in remembering the steps in vacuum extraction. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Exert traction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest limiting vacuum assisted procedures to three contractions for the descent phase, three contractions for the outlet extraction phase, 2 to 3 &quot;pop-offs,&quot; and a total time of 15 to 30 minutes (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Duration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some reasons for failure include fetopelvic disproportion, incorrect technique, paramedian or deflexing applications, and large caput succedaneum. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Failed procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure of an attempted vacuum assisted delivery increases the likelihood of neonatal morbidity; the subsequent use of sequential forceps in this setting is rarely indicated. Prompt cesarean delivery is advised after an unsuccessful vacuum assisted procedure. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Know when to abandon the procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Martin JA, Hamilton BE, Osterman MJ, et al.
