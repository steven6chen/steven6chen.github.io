The term &quot;septic arthritis&quot; usually refers to bacterial arthritis or fungal arthritis, but bacterial joint infections are most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-arthritis-treatment-and-outcome-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The treatment and outcome of bacterial arthritis in infants and children will be reviewed here.

Antimicrobial therapy may be discontinued if the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> C-reactive protein (CRP) have returned to normal by these time points and there is no radiographic evidence of unsuspected osteomyelitis. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Total duration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children receiving appropriate antimicrobial therapy generally demonstrate clinical improvement within three to five days. Clinical improvement is demonstrated by decreased fever; improved joint pain, swelling, erythema, and range of motion; and decreased peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count, ESR <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CRP, and synovial fluid WBC count and culture (if obtained). (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Response to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who do not respond to treatment as expected should be reevaluated. They may require arthrotomy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adjustment of antimicrobial therapy. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Treatment failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We see children who are being treated for bacterial arthritis as outpatients approximately one week after discharge from the hospital and at one- to two-week intervals thereafter. We monitor them for clinical improvement and complications of high-dose antibiotic therapy. We obtain a complete blood count, ESR, CRP, and biochemical profile (including serum aminotransferases) at each visit. (See <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Outpatient follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated rate of residual joint dysfunction is 10 to 25 percent; even with appropriate treatment, approximately 40 percent of patients with hip involvement and 10 percent of patients with knee involvement develop complications. Factors related to poor outcome include duration of symptoms before treatment, involvement of the hip, involvement of the hip or shoulder with concomitant osteomyelitis, and age younger than one year.
