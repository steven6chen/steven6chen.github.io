To satisfy these criteria, the patient must have had all of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Satisfactory colposcopy (visualization of entire cervical squamocolumnar junction).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy confirming presence of CIN; abnormal cytology alone is not sufficient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endocervical curettage (ECC) that is negative or CIN 1.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical cancer in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An excisional procedure should be performed in patients who are not appropriate candidates for ablation. Excisional biopsy is recommended for women with cytological findings potentially associated with high-grade lesions (ie, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, atypical glandular cells).</p><p>Patient-specific risk of complications (eg, bleeding diathesis), patient and clinician preference, and cost also play a role in the choice of treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PROCEDURAL ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cryotherapy and cold coagulation are office procedures. Both CO2 laser ablation and electrocoagulation diathermy may be performed in an office setting, but as they are more painful to patients, general anesthesia in an operating room may be necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Routine preoperative laboratory tests, cultures, and antibiotic prophylaxis are not required.</p><p>We pretreat with an oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to minimize procedure-related cramping (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> 600 mg). A local anesthetic should be provided. Options include injection into the cervical stroma or as a paracervical block; we prefer a stromal block. In one decision analysis, stromal block was the most cost-effective method to avert the pain and cramping during cryosurgery (in women who have taken an NSAID before the procedure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pudendal-and-paracervical-block#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pudendal and paracervical block&quot;, section on 'Women undergoing gynecologic procedures'</a>.)</p><p>For all techniques, the cervix is stained with Lugol's iodine (a solution of elemental iodine and potassium iodide in water) to delineate the lesion to be ablated.</p><p>Most patients will report minor cramping, similar to menstrual cramps, during and after the procedure. Vasomotor symptoms (eg, light-headedness) may occur, and are more common during cryotherapy than during laser ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ABLATIVE TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cryotherapy and laser ablation are the most commonly used methods for cervical ablation. Cold coagulation and diathermy are rarely used in the United States.</p><p>CIN can extend into glandular crypts, thus, the depth of cervical ablation should be at least 4.8 mm for all techniques. This will adequately treat greater than 99 percent of lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cryotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cryotherapy uses a refrigerant gas (carbon dioxide or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a>) to cool the ectocervix with a metal cryoprobe. The ectocervix must be cooled to -20&ordm;C to cause crystallization of intracellular water and destroy the lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This can be achieved by forming an ice ball in the cervical tissue that is at least 5 mm from the tip of the probe.</p><p>Cryoprobes are either flat or cone shaped and vary in diameter (19 or 25 mm). It is not clear whether cryoprobe shape influences treatment efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Selection of the appropriate cryoprobe is controversial. In one study (n = 64), cryotherapy was performed on women prior to hysterectomy, and postoperative histology revealed that adequate tissue destruction (in this study, defined as 4 mm depth and &le;15 mm width) was significantly more likely after use of the large cone-shaped probe (25 mm diameter) than the small flat probe (19 mm diameter; 80 versus 58 percent); results for the other probes (small cone-shaped and large flat) did not differ significantly from the others (67 and 72 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, in a randomized trial (n = 117) women with CIN were assigned to cryotherapy with either a cone-shaped or flat probe (selection of large or small probe was made according to size of cervix); rates of disease found at follow-up colposcopy were similar (77 and 76 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The type of refrigerant gas may also influence outcome. Tissue crystallization induced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> appears to penetrate deeper into the cervical stroma than CO2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Technique</strong> &ndash; Select the appropriate probe and apply a water-soluble lubricant to the probe tip to allow adequate transfer of thermal energy between the probe and the cervical tissue. A note of caution, if the cryoprobe makes contact with the speculum, vaginal tissue in contact with the speculum will also be ablated. An insulated speculum may be used, but is not required. <br/><br/>Activate the cryotherapy unit and, when the optimal freezing temperature is achieved (-65&ordm;C to -85&ordm;C), administer a three-minute freeze and then turn the unit off to allow the cervix to thaw. The probe will then fall free of the cervix and a white &quot;frost&quot; area will be visible. Removing the probe, rather than allowing it to fall off, will cause pain and bleeding. Continue to allow the cervix to defrost and become pink. <br/><br/>Perform a second freeze and again allow the cervix to defrost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In a large meta-analysis of randomized trials, using two <span class=\"nowrap\">freeze/thaw</span> cycles was more effective than one cycle (residual disease rates at 27-month follow-up were 6 versus 16 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">CO2 laser</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laser surgery should only be performed by clinicians with specialized training. The laser is directed at the cervical lesion under colposcopic guidance. Water in the tissue absorbs the laser energy, which destroys the tissue by vaporization. To be effective, the lesion is typically ablated to a depth of 5 mm on the ectocervix and 8 to 9 mm around the endocervix.</p><p>Laser ablation of visible lesions is discussed here; a full discussion of laser conization (ie, the transformation zone is excised using a laser) and principles of laser therapy can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Procedures for cervical conization&quot;, section on 'Laser conization'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-medical-lasers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of medical lasers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Technique</strong> &ndash; Protective eyewear is necessary for any personnel in the procedure room. To avoid inadvertent damage to the surrounding areas from a reflected or misdirected laser beam, use a blackened or brushed speculum and drape the patient's perineum and thighs with wet towels. Avoid paper drapes, as they are flammable.<br/><br/>Visualize the cervix using a colposcope. Using a CO2 laser with a power density of 600 to 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">watts/cm<sup>2</sup></span> is adequate for vaporization. For example, with a spot size of 2 mm, setting the laser to 35 watts will produce a power density of 875 <span class=\"nowrap\">watts/cm<sup>2</sup></span>. In general, obtaining hemostasis requires a spot size of 5 mm or greater.</p><p/><p>Technique varies among surgeons, and there are no data comparing these methods. Some experts advocate using the laser in ultrapulse mode to decrease thermal damage to the surrounding cervical stroma. Also, some experts advise lasering the ectocervix with a defocused beam to provide a several-millimeter margin around the area previously ablated (ie, &quot;brush&quot; lasering).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cold coagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the term &quot;cold&quot; coagulation, this method uses heat to ablate the cervical stroma. The term &quot;cold&quot; coagulation is used because lower temperatures are used compared with electrocoagulation diathermy ablation (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diathermy'</a> below). Similar to cryotherapy, a probe (thermosound) is used to conduct heat to the cervix. Probe temperatures vary from 50&ordm;C to 120&ordm;C. Depth of penetration into the cervical stroma depends on the temperature of the probe and duration of probe application.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Technique</strong> &ndash; Cold coagulation is not commonly used, and a standard technique has not been established. In the largest single-institution experience, a temperature of 100&ordm;C was applied for 20 seconds with overlapping treatment fields for a total treatment time of 40 to 100 seconds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Diathermy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term diathermy means &quot;electrically induced heat.&quot; This technique uses a needle that is attached to an electrosurgical generator (cautery device) to destroy cervical tissue.</p><p>Diathermy is primarily performed as an inpatient procedure requiring general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>], but it can be used in the outpatient setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Technique</strong> &ndash; The diathermy needle is passed into and out of the cervix multiple times to ablate the transformation zone; a spatula can be used to remove desiccated tissue. A setting of 30 to 35 watts has been described, but there does not appear to be a consensus on the optimal current [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The speculum should not touch the diathermy needle.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall, all types of ablative therapy for CIN appear to be effective, with low rates of disease persistence and recurrence (generally &lt;10 percent) at seven or more years after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/15,17-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17-24</a>].</p><p>Despite the high success rates with ablative modalities (particularly CO2 laser and cryotherapy), CIN 2 or 3 or cancer can be missed without an excisional biopsy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE EFFECTS AND COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall, complication rates after ablative therapy are low, approximately 1 to 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, women are more likely to experience discharge after cryotherapy than laser ablation, while the risk of bleeding is higher after laser ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In cryotherapy patients, watery vaginal discharge generally continues for several weeks after treatment. When patients find the discharge bothersome, we remove the necrotic tissue from the cervix using ring forceps.</p><p>Patients with post-treatment bleeding are evaluated with a speculum exam. Bleeding is usually minimal and will resolve with conservative measures in the office, such as application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver nitrate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-subsulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric subsulfate</a> (Monsel's solution). It is rare to encounter bleeding that requires suturing or packing.</p><p>Pelvic infection after ablation is infrequent, but may be increased in patients with other risk factors for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). For example, in one series of 67 adolescents treated with cryotherapy, 9 percent developed PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Late complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Possible late complications are cervical stenosis or obstetric complications.</p><p>Cervical stenosis appears to be rare after cryotherapy or laser ablation; however, there are few data regarding this issue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. In the largest series of cryotherapy or laser ablation, the risk of stenosis was 1 percent or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Although a randomized trial found no significant difference in the incidence of cervical stenosis between the two methods, there was insufficient statistical power to detect a difference in this rare complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cervical anomalies and benign cervical lesions&quot;, section on 'Cervical stenosis'</a>.)</p><p>There is some evidence that the risk of cervical stenosis following cervical ablation is increased for women with a history of in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].

Appropriate follow-up after ablative treatment for CIN is especially critical, as no pathologic diagnosis is obtained at the time of treatment and some patients will go on to develop cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>After laser ablation, the squamocolumnar junction usually returns to its pretreatment location and can be visualized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, following cryotherapy, the squamocolumnar junction may recede into the cervical canal, making subsequent colposcopy difficult. Radial scar lines may also be seen with subsequent colposcopies, and are of no clinical significance.</p><p>Recommendations for follow-up after treatment for CIN are discussed in detail separately elsewhere.

There is some evidence that cryotherapy is more effective than laser ablation for women with CIN 1. A subgroup analysis of the meta-analysis of randomized trials found that women with CIN 1 who were treated with laser ablation had a higher risk of residual disease than those who were treated with cryotherapy (odds ratio 3.3, 95% CI 1.1-10.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. <br/><br/>The strength of this conclusion is attenuated by the use of an unplanned subgroup analysis and by the methodologic flaws in the included trials; however, cryotherapy has several other advantages over laser ablation in this population. Cryotherapy is associated with less perioperative pain and bleeding than laser ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Also, laser equipment is costly, and a laser procedure may require general anesthesia in an inpatient setting, whereas cryotherapy is a relatively simple office procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/4,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,32,33</a>]. A disadvantage of cryotherapy is that a malodorous vaginal discharge is a common side effect and vasomotor symptoms may occur during the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]; however, these effects are easily managed.
