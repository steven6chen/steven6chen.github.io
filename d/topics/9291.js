Knowing the composition of a stone influences clinical decisions. Although the 24-hour urine composition provides information on the possible composition of a patient's stone, this is not perfectly predictive of the stone type and, at times, can be misleading. Thus, instructing the patient to retrieve a passed stone or instructing the urologist, who is performing a stone-related procedure, to save and send a stone fragment for analysis is an important part of the approach to prevent recurrent stone formation. The stone composition may also influence the choice of urologic intervention.</p><p>The most common crystalline materials found in kidney stones are calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, uric acid, and struvite. It is not uncommon for a stone to contain more than one crystalline component. Noncrystalline materials found in stones include proteins and blood. Some laboratories report the composition of the nidus (if present) separately from the composition of the body of the stone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H700709201\"><span class=\"h1\">INDIVIDUAL CRYSTALLINE COMPONENTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H700709209\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcium oxalate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcium oxalate is the most common component found in kidney stones (approximately 70 to 80 percent). Calcium oxalate can be found in monohydrate (crystal name: whewellite) and dihydrate (crystal name: weddellite) forms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65169\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65169 \">picture 1</a>). Calcium oxalate can also be present in combination with uric acid or calcium phosphate. Because calcium oxalate stones typically grow on a Randall's plaque (composed of calcium phosphate) on the papillary tip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-kidney-stone-composition-analysis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], a laboratory that examines the composition of the nidus may report a stone with an eccentric calcium phosphate nidus (usually 5 percent) and a calcium oxalate body (95 percent).</p><p>Urinary risk factors for calcium oxalate crystal formation are lower urine volume, higher urine calcium excretion, higher urine oxalate excretion, and lower urine citrate excretion. Calcium oxalate crystals are pH insensitive in the physiologic pH range of 5 to 8. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for calcium stones in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H700709215\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcium phosphate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcium phosphate is found in approximately 15 percent of kidney stones and can be present in combination with calcium oxalate or struvite. Because of differences in solubility due to urine pH, calcium phosphate is not found mixed with uric acid. The two forms of calcium phosphate include apatite (sometimes reported as carbonate apatite), which is the crystal type found in bone, or calcium hydrogen phosphate (brushite); the frequency of apatite is much greater than brushite. Calcium phosphate crystals in the urine sediment are typically dark and amorphous.</p><p>Urinary risk factors for calcium phosphate crystal formation are lower urine volume, higher urine calcium excretion, lower urine citrate excretion, higher urinary pH, and, likely, higher urine phosphate excretion. In contrast to calcium oxalate crystals, calcium phosphate crystals are pH sensitive, forming in &quot;alkaline&quot; urine (usually pH 6.5 or higher). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for calcium stones in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H700709221\"><span class=\"h2\">Uric acid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uric acid is the most common crystal form that contains urate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F61827\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61827 \">picture 2</a>). Rare crystals that contain urate include sodium urate (which is present in the joint fluid of patients with gouty arthritis) and ammonium urate. Uric acid is present in approximately 8 percent of analyzed stones, sometimes in combination with calcium oxalate.</p><p>The urinary risk factors for uric acid crystal formation are lower urine volume, higher urine uric acid excretion, and, most importantly, lower urinary pH. Uric acid crystals are pH sensitive, only forming in &quot;acidic&quot; urine (usually pH 5.5 or lower). The urine pH is a much stronger promoter of uric acid crystal formation than the amount of uric acid in the urine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uric-acid-nephrolithiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uric acid nephrolithiasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H700709227\"><span class=\"h2\">Struvite</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Struvite is the crystal name for stones that form only in the presence of urease-producing bacteria (eg, <em>Proteus mirabilis</em>) in the upper urinary tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F108401\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108401 \">picture 3</a>). Other names for this crystal type include &quot;triple phosphate&quot; (because the phosphate is in the triple-negative form) and magnesium ammonium phosphate carbonate apatite.</p><p>Struvite is found in approximately 1 percent of analyzed stones and is much more common in women than in men (due to the higher risk of urinary tract infections in women). If a preexisting calcium-containing kidney stone is subsequently infected with a urease-producing bacterium, the stone analysis may report that the composition of the stone includes calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate in addition to struvite.</p><p>Because urease splits urea into one carbon dioxide molecule and two ammonia molecules, the net reaction often leads to a urine pH outside of the physiologic range (8.5 or 9). Other than the presence of urease, there are no other urinary risk factors for struvite crystal formation.

An important study, for example, evaluated the accuracy of stone-composition analysis performed by commercial laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-kidney-stone-composition-analysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. First, 25 human kidney stones were analyzed with infrared spectroscopy to determine their composition; these stones were then fragmented equally and sent to five commercial laboratories for analysis; the following observations were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stones of a single component (&quot;pure&quot; stones) were reported reliably.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Struvite was not reported in half of the stones that did contain struvite.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Struvite was reported in some stones that did not contain struvite.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stones that contained calcium oxalate were reported reliably, but the subtypes (ie, calcium oxalate monohydrate or calcium oxalate dihydrate) were not reported reliably.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apatite was missed in 20 percent of the stones containing apatite.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A stone containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atazanavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atazanavir</a> was not identified by any of the laboratories.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The terminology used for reporting apatite varied by laboratory.</p><p/><p>The authors concluded that these commercial laboratories reliably reported pure stones, but there was variability in both the reporting of mixed stones and the nomenclature used. These findings need to be kept in mind when interpreting stone-composition reports.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H700709245\"><span class=\"h2\">Can CT be used to determine stone composition?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with nephrolithiasis often have at least one computed tomography (CT) exam. The size and shape of the stone on CT does not provide information on the specific crystal composition. As an example, among staghorn calculi in one study, just 23 out of 52 (44 percent) were due to upper tract infection, despite the common notion that staghorn calculi represent infection stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-kidney-stone-composition-analysis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Of the 29 staghorn calculi that were not due to infection, the composition varied: 55 percent were calcium phosphate, 21 percent were uric acid, 14 percent were calcium oxalate, and 10 percent were cystine.</p><p>The Hounsfield unit value obtained from a standard CT scan relates to the density of the material in the area of interest, such as a stone. Studies have found that calcium oxalate and brushite stones have high Hounsfield unit values, while uric acid stones have low Hounsfield unit values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-kidney-stone-composition-analysis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, this approach is not sufficiently accurate to definitively determine the composition<sup> </sup>of stones, including struvite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-kidney-stone-composition-analysis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Dual energy CT may be somewhat more accurate. In one study, for example, dual energy CT was able to correctly identify the composition of 82 percent of stones from 27 patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy for a very large stone burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-kidney-stone-composition-analysis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The accuracy varied by stone type: six of six (100 percent) uric acid stones and one of one cystine stones were correctly identified, compared with 15 of 19 (79 percent) calcium oxalate stones; the single struvite stone was not correctly identified. The accuracy of dual energy CT may be enhanced with computerized post-processing algorithms that use a pixel-by-pixel analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-kidney-stone-composition-analysis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Thus, dual energy CT with advanced post-processing algorithms may provide valuable diagnostic information. However, CT cannot be used exclusively to determine stone composition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H700709251\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL RELEVANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Knowing the composition of the stone assists with clinical decision making for the treatment of existing stones and prevention of new stone formation. Examples of how this knowledge can impact clinical decision making include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcium oxalate monohydrate and brushite are hard stones and may not be fragmented as easily with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uric acid stones form in acid urine, and alkalinization of the urine can both dissolve existing uric acid stones and prevent new stones from forming.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcium phosphate stones form in alkaline urine, and, therefore, increasing the urine pH may increase the likelihood of calcium phosphate precipitation. While reducing the urine pH would be helpful, this is often not clinically possible for most patients who form calcium phosphate stones (for unclear reasons).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of certain stone types may indicate the existence of an underlying predisposing condition. As examples, calcium phosphate stones are more frequent in individuals with primary hyperparathyroidism and distal renal tubular acidosis, and struvite stones form in the presence of an upper urinary tract infection. Uric acid stones may be more common in individuals with diabetes mellitus, perhaps due to impaired ammoniagenesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for calcium stones in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>When designing a preventive regimen for a patient, the individual components of the stone need to be considered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pure stones, the focus is on modifying the urine composition to prevent the precipitation of that specific crystal type, even if the 24-hour urine composition suggests a high risk for precipitation of another crystal type.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For mixed stones, the treatment recommendations depend upon the specific components and the relative amounts present. As an example, for a stone that is reported to contain 95 percent calcium oxalate and 5 percent calcium phosphate, the focus should be on reducing the supersaturation of calcium oxalate. However, these two crystal types share risk factors (lower urine volume, higher urine calcium, and lower urine citrate), so modifying these components should reduce the risk of both crystal types. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent calcium stones in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Given the variability in reporting of mixed stones by commercial laboratories, it is important to keep in mind the clinical setting and other available information and to question the reliability of the stone-composition report if it seems inconsistent with the patient's history. A report indicating the presence of struvite, for example, is probably inaccurate in a patient with no documented infection with a urease-producing bacterium. It is also important to examine the urine sediment for crystals as this might help identify the crystal type.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H700709257\"><span class=\"h2\">How many stones should be analyzed?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At least one stone should be analyzed in every patient for the reasons mentioned above. Given sampling issues, analyzing two stones provides useful information about other possible <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> relevant components. If the two stone-composition reports are sufficiently similar, then future stones do not need to be analyzed unless there has been a clinically relevant change. However, some patients produce more than one stone type. In a study of patients with bilateral stones, for example, the major stone component was discordant between the two kidneys in 25 percent of individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-kidney-stone-composition-analysis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In this setting, it would be reasonable to analyze more than one stone that is passed from each side. Also, if a new stone forms after many years, it should be sent for analysis if passed or retrieved.</p><p>Occasionally, treatment to prevent one stone type may inadvertently lead to the formation of a different stone type (though this is uncommon). As an example, alkalinization of the urine of a patient with uric acid stones could increase the risk of calcium phosphate crystal formation. Thus, analysis of a newly formed stone after the initiation of treatment is indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H507726869\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
