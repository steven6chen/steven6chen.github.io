Rarely are arrhythmias fatal; however, sudden cardiac death (SCD) resulting from a malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmia is a devastating event in young and apparently healthy persons.</p><p>This topic will discuss the treatment of arrhythmias in athletes, along with the discussion of returning to <span class=\"nowrap\">competition/participation</span>. The clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation of athletes with specific arrhythmias or arrhythmia-related syndromes are discussed in detail separately. Additionally, the risk of sudden death in athletes and the approach to screening to prevent sudden death in athletes are discussed elsewhere.

On the other hand, syncope occurring after exertion (eg, during cooling off period) is more likely reflex in origin, similar to the vasovagal faint. Therapies to prevent recurrent syncope in athletes are highly variable depending upon the suspected etiology of the syncope. The diagnostic approach and management of syncope in athletes is similar to that in non-athletes and is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Athletes with concerning syncope should have a full evaluation to ascertain the presence of underlying cardiac disease responsible for the syncope. Return to sport is permitted after the cause has been determined and, if necessary, treated. When any underlying cardiac disease has been reasonably excluded, the athlete can safely return to sport without restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-with-arrhythmias-treatment-and-returning-to-athletic-participation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, athletes with syncope or presyncope with a high risk of recurrence should not participate in sports where the likelihood of even a momentary loss of consciousness may be hazardous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> potentially responsible for adverse events (such as scuba diving, rock climbing, automobile racing, etc). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2910947540\"><span class=\"h1\">AV CONDUCTION ABNORMALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Altered atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction (eg, first degree AV block and Mobitz type I second degree AV block) can result from increased vagal tone, which is normally seen as an adaptive response to certain types of athletic conditioning, particularly endurance training (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F102509\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102509 \">table 1</a>). No specific limitations are necessary in this setting as long as the athlete is asymptomatic and the conduction abnormalities improve (ie, disappear) with exertion. However, higher degrees of AV conduction abnormality will require attention prior to participation in athletics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H247621328\"><span class=\"h2\">First degree AV block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First-degree AV block, characterized by prolongation of the PR interval (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67882\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef67882 \">waveform 1</a>), is commonly seen in athletes and has no important implications.

Asymptomatic athletes in whom Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) second degree AV block initially appears or worsens with exercise may need further evaluation, as worsening of Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) second degree AV block with exercise is highly suspicious for a structural pathologic condition affecting the AV <span class=\"nowrap\">node/His-Purkinje</span> system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105651\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105651 \">figure 1</a>). Though Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) second degree AV block rarely causes symptoms, symptomatic athletes may need ventricular pacing and should undergo treatment of any associated potentially reversible causes (eg, myocardial ischemia). The development of Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) second degree AV block during exercise should prompt referral to an electrophysiologist.

Mobitz type II second degree AV block is by nature unstable and frequently progresses to third degree (complete) AV block. In the absence of a potentially reversible condition (ie, Lyme carditis), Mobitz II AV block generally requires a pacemaker before permitting resumption of regular physical activity or sport activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-with-arrhythmias-treatment-and-returning-to-athletic-participation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Nearly all athletes with third degree (complete) AV block will present with some degree of symptoms (eg, lightheadedness, presyncope, syncope, fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, sudden cardiac arrest), though the severity of the symptoms can be quite variable. In the absence of a potentially reversible condition (ie, Lyme carditis), acquired third degree (complete) AV block should be treated with a pacemaker before permitting resumption of regular physical or sport activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-with-arrhythmias-treatment-and-returning-to-athletic-participation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In young athletes, AF may occur in the absence of any structural heart disease or other provoking condition and is termed &quot;lone AF.&quot; However, in older athletes, hypertension and coronary artery disease are common underlying conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F102509\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102509 \">table 1</a>). As with any patient with AF, athletes with AF should be evaluated for potential underlying causes (eg, thyroid disease, binge alcohol use, etc). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-new-onset-atrial-fibrillation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of new onset atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Evaluation for an underlying cause'</a>.)</p><p>Athletes with self-terminating lone AF in the documented absence of structural heart disease can participate in all competitive sports.

Rhythm control can be achieved with antiarrhythmic agents or ablation procedures. Increasingly, ablation has shown a sustained benefit, particularly in those with paroxysmal AF in the presence of a normal heart, which is the most common scenario in athletes. Athletes without structural heart disease who have elimination of AF by an ablation technique, including surgery, may participate in all competitive sports (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105651\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105651 \">figure 1</a>) after four to six weeks without a recurrence. Athletes with <span class=\"nowrap\">recurrent/persistent</span> AF (not undergoing ablation) can selectively participate in competitive sports if the ventricular rate increases and slows appropriately and is comparable with that of a normal sinus response in relation to the level of activity. In this case, evaluation should be individualized and regular follow-up is advised. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhythm control versus rate control in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The other component of management is anticoagulation.

Therefore, the decision to anticoagulate should be individually considered. However, athletes who require anticoagulation should not participate in sports with danger of bodily collision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105651\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105651 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H124596950\"><span class=\"h2\">Atrial flutter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sustained atrial flutter is uncommon in athletes.

Rarely are arrhythmias fatal; however, sudden cardiac death resulting from a malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmia is a devastating event in young and apparently healthy persons. (See <a href=\"#H2653555018\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syncope that occurs during exertion suggests a potentially life-threatening arrhythmic etiology (eg, aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ventricular arrhythmia, etc) and should be evaluated urgently. On the other hand, syncope occurring after exertion (eg, during cooling off period) is more likely reflex in origin, similar to the vasovagal faint. (See <a href=\"#H2431228412\" class=\"local\">'Syncope'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Altered atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction (eg, first degree AV block and Mobitz type I second degree AV block) can result from increased vagal tone, which is normally seen as an adaptive response to certain types of athletic conditioning and is generally not a cause for concern. However, higher degrees of AV conduction abnormality (eg, Mobitz type II second degree AV block and third degree AV block) will require attention prior to participation in athletics. (See <a href=\"#H2910947540\" class=\"local\">'AV conduction abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinus bradycardia and sinus tachycardia that are appropriate for the clinical situation are not considered abnormal, and further testing is not necessary. Asymptomatic sinus pauses or sinus arrest of less than three seconds duration are not uncommonly seen in normal athletes and are of no clinical significance. However, longer pauses, sinoatrial exit block, and sick sinus syndrome are abnormal. (See <a href=\"#H1653332248\" class=\"local\">'Sinus node dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial premature beats are common in the general population and in athletes, and are not generally associated with underlying structural heart disease or symptoms. Ventricular premature beats (VPBs) are also common in athletes of all age groups and occur in those with or without structural heart disease; the identification of VPBs should prompt an evaluation for the presence of underlying pathologic substrate. (See <a href=\"#H3121402978\" class=\"local\">'Atrial or junctional premature beats'</a> above and <a href=\"#H991302103\" class=\"local\">'Ventricular premature beats'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sustained atrial fibrillation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> atrial flutter are uncommon in athletes.

Patients with infrequent episodes of AVNRT, or those with minimal or well-tolerated symptoms, opt for a conservative management approach with either no specific therapy or pharmacologic suppression. If pharmacologic therapy fails or if the side effects result from chronic medical therapy, catheter ablation remains the preferred option. (See <a href=\"#H4263080432\" class=\"local\">'Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern manifest ventricular pre-excitation on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG). When this pattern is associated with documented tachycardia or symptoms referable to tachycardia, the patient is said to have the WPW syndrome. The most common arrhythmia occurring in patients with WPW is an atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT), although atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias may arise. Athletes with ventricular pre-excitation on the ECG and symptoms of palpitations, presyncope, or syncope, or with documented arrhythmia (ie, WPW syndrome) should undergo invasive electrophysiologic testing for both diagnostic and potential therapeutic (ie, catheter ablation of the accessory pathway) purposes.
