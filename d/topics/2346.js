Blisters are fluid-filled bumps on the skin.</p><p>Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease is when the body's infection-fighting system attacks healthy tissue instead of infections. Sometimes, bullous pemphigoid happens after people take certain medicines.</p><p>This condition happens most often in adults age 60 and older.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H587774556\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of bullous pemphigoid?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most commonly, bullous pemphigoid causes large blisters to form on the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F87308\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87308 \">picture 1</a>). Most blisters happen on the trunk, arms, legs, armpits, or groin, but blisters can happen all over the body. The blisters can come and go. After a blister pops, you might see an open sore. These sores usually heal without a scar.</p><p>People with bullous pemphigoid also often have red, raised areas of skin. The red areas can be under the blisters or in other places (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F87309\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87309 \">picture 2</a>). Some people have only the red, raised areas of skin and no blisters. Itching is common.</p><p>Some people with bullous pemphigoid also get sores in their mouth. These sores can hurt and can make it hard to eat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H587774571\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for bullous pemphigoid?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To check whether your symptoms are caused by bullous pemphigoid, your doctor will do a test called a skin biopsy. He or she will remove small samples of tissue from a blister or from the red, raised areas of skin. Then another doctor will do tests on the samples and look at them under a microscope. Your doctor might also order special blood tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H587774586\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to manage my symptoms?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You should not pop your blisters unless your doctor tells you to. Also, you should follow your doctor's instructions about how to take care of your sores. That way, your skin is less likely to get infected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H587774601\"><span class=\"h1\">How is bullous pemphigoid treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment usually includes 1 or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid creams or ointments &ndash; These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally. These medicines can reduce inflammation and itching and prevent new blisters from forming.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid pills &ndash; Steroid pills can also reduce blisters, inflammation, and itching. Since steroid pills can have side effects, it is important that you take them exactly as prescribed and see your doctor for regular follow-ups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medicines that &quot;calm down&quot; the immune system</p><p/><p>Treatment usually lasts 1 to 2 years or longer. Sometimes, symptoms return after treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H587774616\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blisters-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Blisters (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-steroid-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Oral steroid medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=side-effects-from-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Side effects from medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brand-versus-generic-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brand versus generic medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=taking-medicines-when-youre-older-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Taking medicines when you're older (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
