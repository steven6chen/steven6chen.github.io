A thorough understanding of the anatomy of the growing wrist, common wrist injuries, and other causes of wrist pain are essential to accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.</p><p>Causes of chronic wrist pain in children and adolescents include acute injuries that have failed to heal, overuse syndromes, and pain unrelated to trauma. Traumatic and nontraumatic causes of chronic wrist pain in children and adolescents will be presented here. Acute wrist injuries, wrist anatomy, and the evaluation of wrist pain in children and adolescents are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-acute-wrist-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of acute wrist injuries in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-wrist-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of wrist pain and injury in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERUSE INJURIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overuse injuries, which include tendonitis, distal radius physeal stress reaction, Kienb&ouml;ck's disease, chronic distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injury, neuropathy, and impaction syndromes, are more common among adolescents than younger children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63434\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63434 \">table 1</a>). Overuse injuries have insidious symptoms; they frequently are identified when an acute injury is superimposed at the site of previous microtrauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Risk factors for overuse injuries in children and adolescents include rapid intensification of training, muscle-tendon imbalance, poor conditioning before training, deficient nutrition, associated chronic disease, and periods of rapid growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Tendon injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tendonitis involves inflammation of the tendon or its synovial sheath. Tendonitis is caused by repetitive motion or impact stress (eg, in gymnastics, racquet sports). Clinical features include pain that is exacerbated by activity and can be reproduced by passive stretching of the affected tendon or active contraction of the associated muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Radiographs are not usually necessary in the evaluation of patients with tendonitis but may be helpful in excluding other injuries or conditions.</p><p>Treatment strategies for tendonitis include rest, bracing, antiinflammatory agents, glucocorticoid injections, and correcting the training error or biomechanical etiology. Sports activity can be gradually resumed once symptoms have resolved.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>De Quervain's</strong> &ndash; De Quervain's tenosynovitis involves the sheath of the abductor pollicis longus and the extensor pollicis brevis at the level of the radial styloid. De Quervain's tenosynovitis occurs in individuals who golf, fly fish, or play racquet sports. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=de-quervain-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;de Quervain tendinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ECU tendonitis</strong> &ndash; Extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendonitis is seen in participants of sports that require forceful wrist extension (eg, racquet sports, golf, rowing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Inflammation occurs in the sixth dorsal extensor compartment as the ECU tendons pass in a groove along the ulna [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Clinical features of ECU tendonitis include tenderness and swelling over the ECU tendon in the ulnar groove and pain that is exacerbated by wrist extension against resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Relief of pain with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> injection into the ECU sheath can confirm the diagnosis if confirmation is necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Initial treatment involves rest, immobilization with a neutral wrist brace, modification of activities, and oral antiinflammatory agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Glucocorticoid injection into the sheath is a reasonable second-line option. Failure to improve with these treatments may indicate additional pathology and further evaluation is warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Surgical decompression with division of the subsheath housing the ECU tendon is the final treatment option.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ECU subluxation</strong> &ndash; ECU subluxation results from rupture or attenuation of the ECU subsheath, usually due to sudden wrist flexion under ulnar deviation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It may occur in golfers, weight lifters, rodeo riders, tennis players, and baseball players [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients complain of dorsal ulnar wrist pain and &quot;snapping&quot; that are increased with rotation of the forearm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. On examination, the ECU tendon can be observed subluxing over the ulnar styloid when the patient deviates the wrist ulnarly in full supination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. ECU subluxation responds well to immobilization; surgical reconstruction is rarely needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>FCR tendonitis</strong> &ndash; Flexor carpi radialis (FCR) tendonitis presents with pain at the area of the FCR with resisted flexion or passive wrist extension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69097\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69097 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Initial treatment involves rest, immobilization in a neutral wrist brace, antiinflammatory agents, and stretching exercises. Glucocorticoid injection is slightly more difficult since the FCR is in close proximity to the radial artery. In prolonged cases, surgery may be indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>FCU tendonitis</strong> &ndash; The flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) tendon partially fans out in its distal insertion on to the pisiform before attaching to the base of the fifth metacarpal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69097\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69097 \">figure 1</a>). Flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) tendonitis can result from repetitive motion or pisotriquetral compression. Compression occurs from loading, hitting with an open fist (eg, in karate), or trauma (eg, from the end of a racquet, stick, or club at the end of the swing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The characteristic feature of FCU tendonitis is pain in the region of the FCU tendon with resisted wrist flexion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Pain with compression of the pisotriquetral complex is more suggestive of pisotriquetral arthritis or contusion. Point tenderness over the hamate is more suggestive of hamate fracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-acute-wrist-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of acute wrist injuries in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Hamate fractures'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Plain radiographs are normal in patients with FCU tendonitis. They may show degenerative changes at the pisotriquetral joint in patients with pisotriquetral arthritis or fractures of the hook of the hamate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-acute-wrist-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of acute wrist injuries in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Hamate fractures'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Conservative management with rest, a neutral wrist brace, and stretching is usually successful for FCU tendonitis secondary to repetitive motion or pisotriquetral compression. Subperiosteal excision of the pisiform can be curative for recalcitrant cases of pisotriquetral arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intersection syndrome</strong> &ndash; Intersection syndrome results from repetitive wrist extension against resistance (eg, rowing, weight lifting) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Pain and tenderness are localized at the point of intersection of the abductor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis brevis, and the extensor carpi radialis. Active extension of the wrist and thumb against resistance triggers pain 4 to 6 cm proximal to the wrist joint dorsally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This maneuver may be accompanied by palpable or audible crepitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Symptoms usually respond to rest, a neutral wrist brace with thumb spica extension, and antiinflammatory agents, with or without glucocorticoid injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Surgical decompression may be necessary in refractory cases. Sports activity can be gradually resumed once symptoms have resolved.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Distal radius physeal stress reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repetitive loading of the extended wrist can lead to stress and eventual osteolysis of the distal radial growth plate. The typical patient is female, 12 to 14 years of age, and doing gymnastics about 35 hours per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Distal radius physeal stress reaction also occurs in rock climbers and weight lifters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It should be suspected in patients with dorsal pain made worse by stress loading, such as vaulting or hand-walking and no history of acute trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Distal radius stress reaction may result in growth inhibition or premature growth arrest of the radius. If this occurs, there is relative overgrowth of the ulna (&quot;positive ulnar variance&quot;). Radial shortening may be accompanied by ulnocarpal impaction and tears of the TFCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Ulnar impaction'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-acute-wrist-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of acute wrist injuries in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'TFCC injuries'</a>.)</p><p>Early in the course, before radiographic changes, wrist pain with extension and axial loading may be the only manifestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. At this stage, restriction of activity for at least two to four weeks facilitates the return of full strength and pain-free range of motion. Full strength and pain-free range of motion are necessary before progressive return to grip and tumbling exercises.</p><p>Radiographic findings, which include widening and irregularity (cystic and sclerotic changes) of the growth plate and palmar spurring of the metaphysis, indicate more severe disease. Elite gymnasts may develop radiographic changes without symptoms; regular radiographic examination may be justified in such athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Once radiographic changes are present, cast or forearm-based volar splint immobilization for four to eight weeks is typically necessary for resolution of symptoms and signs. Radiographic healing lags behind clinical improvement. Restriction of activity is essential in patients with radial shortening; such patients also may require surgical treatment for ulnocarpal impingement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic techniques for splinting of musculoskeletal injuries&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If there is a positive ulnar variance and conservative management does not improve symptoms, surgical debridement and ulnar shortening may be indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Kienb&ouml;ck's disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kienb&ouml;ck's disease is a progressive collapse of the lunate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82436\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82436 \">figure 2</a>). The mechanism remains unclear but appears to involve disruption of the blood supply, possibly related to undiagnosed fractures of the lunate, repetitive trauma, or abnormal biomechanical loading patterns at the radiocarpal joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11</a>].</p><p>Kienb&ouml;ck's disease may be seen in adolescents involved in repetitive impact activities (eg, volleyball, the martial arts) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,4,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,12,13</a>]. It affects the dominant wrist and presents insidiously; symptoms typically begin in young adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The most common symptoms are dorsal wrist pain with mild swelling followed by persistent pain, crepitation, stiffness, and decreased range of motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>]. There may be associated weakness or difficulty grasping heavy objects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14,15</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis is made radiographically (AP views). In the earliest stages, radiographs are normal but bone scan shows increased uptake and MRI shows decreased signal in the lunate on T1 images. With progression, there is increased density in the lunate (Stage 2), followed by bony collapse (Stage 3), and, finally, carpal instability and arthritis (Stage 4).</p><p>Early referral to a hand surgeon is essential. Treatment options range from immobilization for Stage 1 disease, to revascularization, radial shortening procedures, and arthrodesis for end-stage disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic DRUJ and TFCC injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic DRUJ injuries are usually related to repetitive pronation as may occur in tennis, gymnastics, or bowling. Chronic DRUJ instability also may follow trauma to the wrist, presenting months later with progressive pain with supination and pronation. Initial radiographs may be normal or demonstrate degenerative changes at the sigmoid notch between the radius and ulna. Definitive treatment is usually surgical.</p><p>Chronic TFCC injury is caused by repetitive activity involving twisting, compression, and ulnar deviation (eg, tennis, squash, ice hockey, golf, baseball, softball, boxing, water skiing, and pole vaulting) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4,14,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14,16-18</a>].</p><p>Chronic TFCC tears are believed to be the result of ulnar impaction. Impaction on the lunate on the ulnar head puts increased axial pressure on the TFCC, eventually wearing it down and creating a central perforation. If impaction continues, lunate and ulnar chondromalacia develop, followed by arthritic changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Ulnar impaction'</a> below.)</p><p>Treatment of chronic TFCC tears requires arthroscopy with repair or debridement. If ulnar impaction is the cause of the TFCC tear, an ulnar shortening procedure (to correct the underlying cause of impaction) is usually carried out in addition to TFCC debridement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuropathy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Carpal tunnel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carpal tunnel syndrome (median neuropathy) is the most common compressive neuropathy in sports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Because of the limited capacity of the synovial cavity of the radiocarpal joint, excess synovial fluid escapes through a sinus into the subcutaneous tissues where the body confines it by forming a surrounding thick wall (a ganglion cyst). A ganglion cyst may present as an obvious swelling on physical examination, or it may only be manifested by wrist pain. The majority of wrist ganglia are located on the dorsal surface. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganglion-cysts-of-the-wrist-and-hand\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ganglion cysts of the wrist and hand&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">NONTRAUMATIC CAUSES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Juvenile idiopathic arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The wrist and hand are frequently involved in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).

Risk factors include malabsorption, lack of sunlight exposure, malnutrition, kidney disease, and hereditary enzyme deficiencies. Laboratory findings include decreased calcium and increased phosphorus, alkaline phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone. Radiographs reveal widening of the epiphysis and fraying of the distal metaphysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F80989\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80989 \">image 1</a>). Early treatment is associated with improved potential for catch-up growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

It usually presents in childhood with progressive pain and stiffness of the wrists, feet, and elbows. The clinical picture is often mistaken for JIA but labs are normal and radiographs show a characteristic appearance of the lack of any carpal bones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital wrist abnormalities include skeletal dysplasias, hereditary absent radius syndrome, constriction ring syndromes (amniotic band syndromes), and Madelung deformity. If these abnormalities are severe, they can lead to abnormal joint surface contact and the development of arthritis over time. Early swelling, due to venous or lymphatic obstruction, may occur with severe constriction ring syndromes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amniotic-band-sequence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amniotic band sequence&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Madelung deformity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Madelung deformity is a focal dysplasia of the distal radial physis. Premature closure leads to a progressive deformity with dorsal displacement of the ulna and palmar displacement of the carpus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94419\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94419 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94420\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef94420 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Madelung deformity occurs in girls and is usually bilateral.</p><p>Madelung deformity is usually detected between 8 and 12 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Clinical features include prominence of the distal end of the ulna, limitation of supination, and DRUJ incongruity with forearm rotation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Activity-related wrist pain typically develops in late adolescence. Associated conditions include Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis, Hurler syndrome, Turner syndrome, achondroplasia, and Ollier disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of Madelung deformity is made radiographically; radiographs of both wrists, forearms, and elbows should be obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Radiographic abnormalities include shortening of the radius and abnormal distal radial articulations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) show physeal narrowing or closure of the palmar and ulnar aspects of the distal radial physis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Generalized bone dysplasia and post-infectious and post-traumatic deformity should be excluded.</p><p>The treatment depends upon severity.
