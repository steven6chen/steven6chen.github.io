In determining whether a drug is a teratogen, many authorities stipulate that the exposure causes a pattern of defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/teratogenicity-pregnancy-complications-and-postnatal-risks-of-antipsychotics-benzodiazepines-lithium-and-electroconvulsive-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, if exposure is associated with an increase in birth defects greater than that expected in the general population, but the defects vary and there is no discernible pattern, the drug is generally not considered teratogenic.

As an example, the fetus is most vulnerable to major morphologic teratogenesis during organogenesis in the embryonic period of the first trimester, between the third and eighth week of gestation (weeks of gestation are counted from the first day of the last menstrual period) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65816\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65816 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56642\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56642 \">figure 2</a>).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks associated with epilepsy and pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Effect of antiseizure drugs on the fetus'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most studies have found that exposure during pregnancy to first- and second-generation antipsychotics does not appear to increase the risk of major physical malformations above rates observed in the general population. However, chronic administration of antipsychotics during the third trimester may cause symptoms of neonatal toxicity and withdrawal. (See <a href=\"#H1561506\" class=\"local\">'Antipsychotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The best evidence suggests that exposure to benzodiazepines or to hypnotic, benzodiazepine receptor agonists during pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations. Benzodiazepines also do not appear to be associated with low birth weight. However, antenatal exposure to benzodiazepines appears to be associated with spontaneous abortion and preterm birth. Chronic administration of benzodiazepines proximal to delivery can cause neonatal toxicity and withdrawal. (See <a href=\"#H1561527\" class=\"local\">'Benzodiazepines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although observational studies have found that fetal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> exposure is associated with teratogenic effects, the increased absolute risk of congenital abnormalities (7 per 1000) is considered small. The associated teratogenic effects may involve the heart (eg, Ebstein&rsquo;s anomaly of the tricuspid valve), but the results from different studies are conflicting as to whether antenatal lithium exposure is associated with cardiac defects. Second and third trimester lithium exposure can lead to neonatal complications and lithium toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H1561534\" class=\"local\">'Lithium'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neither the number nor pattern of congenital malformations in children exposed in utero to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) implicates it as a causal factor in organ dysgenesis. The risk of neonatal toxicity and adverse developmental effects posed by ECT also appears to be low.
