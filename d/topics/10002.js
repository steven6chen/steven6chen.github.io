Such lymphocyte trafficking through the allograft has been hypothesized to contribute to the development of a degree of immunological tolerance. On the other hand, approximately 5 to 10 percent of liver transplantation recipients who develop acute cellular rejection progress to severe ductopenic rejection despite antirejection therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These patients may require retransplantation.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute cellular liver transplantation rejection are described below. The treatment of this complication and a review of transplantation immunobiology are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-cellular-rejection-of-the-liver-allograft\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute cellular rejection of the liver allograft&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transplantation-immunobiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transplantation immunobiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute rejection in liver transplant recipients is an important clinical event and identification of risk factors for rejection may permit a more individualized approach to immunosuppressive therapy.</p><p>In a study of two large cohorts of liver transplant recipients, at least one biopsy-proven acute rejection episode occurred in 27 percent recipients in the Adult to Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation (A2ALL) cohort and in 15.6 percent recipients in Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Early acute cellular rejection mostly occurs within 90 days. Although older studies suggest that early acute rejection episodes do not adversely affect graft or patient outcomes, data from the A2ALL and SRTR cohorts showed that acute rejection within six months post-transplant was associated with higher risk of graft failure (HR 1.91, 95%CI 1.21-3.01, and HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.63-1.92, respectively) and death (HR 1.86, 95%CI 1.00-3.47, and HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.52-1.83, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. The risk of acute rejection was lower in recipients who had a biologically related donor in both A2ALL and SRTR cohorts (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43-0.76, and HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66-0.91, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1657182316\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors for acute rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk of rejection was higher in the A2ALL and SRTR database for recipients with primary biliary cirrhosis (HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.31-3.36, and HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.22-1.53, respectively) or hepatitis C (HR 2.22, 95% CI 1.57-3.16 and HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.05-1.18, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Most (73 percent) responded to pulse intravenous steroids, while 5 percent were steroid-resistant.</p><p>It has been suggested that in some cases, donor-specific HLA alloantibodies (DSAs) have the ability to persist after liver transplantation and potentially contribute to both acute cellular rejection and allograft injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of clinical signs and symptoms may be observed in patients with rejection, and include fever, malaise, abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, and rarely, increasing ascites. However, none of these is specific for rejection.</p><p>Acute cellular rejection is generally suspected based upon the development of hepatic biochemical test abnormalities, which may include elevations of some or all of the following: serum aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and bilirubin levels. However, these abnormalities are neither sensitive nor specific for distinguishing acute cellular rejection from other causes of hepatic allograft dysfunction and do not correlate with the severity of the rejection episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p>Abnormalities in the hepatic biochemical tests in the short-term post-transplantation period are frequently a manifestation of preservation injury or acute cellular rejection. Preservation injury usually manifests with elevation of the alkaline phosphatase and GGT, without a significant increase in total bilirubin. By contrast, elevation of transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) together with rising bilirubin level <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> GGT should raise concern for acute cellular rejection.</p><p>Because of the limitations of hepatic biochemical tests alone as indicators of acute cellular rejection, other biochemical tests have been evaluated in an attempt to diagnose liver allograft rejection without the need for liver biopsy. Serum concentrations of soluble interleukin-2 receptor, soluble CD8, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecules have been suggested as indicators of hepatic allograft rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. However, there appears to be considerable overlap in the results of these tests with post-transplantation CMV hepatitis. Other markers that have been studied to diagnose rejection include beta-2-microglobulin in serum and bile, tumor necrosis factor-alpha in serum, tissue and blood eosinophilia, and interleukin-6 in bile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>].</p><p>More recent novel approaches to the non-histologic diagnosis of acute cellular rejection have included measurement of alanine aminopeptidase N (APN) in bile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], specific transcriptome patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], and pattern of serum proteomic profile wherein complement component 4 (C4) and ALT were highly predictive of acute cellular rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In addition, hepatocyte derived microRNAs (HDmiRs, mir-122, miR-148a) have been evaluated as markers of acute cellular rejection. HDmiRs were elevated up to 20-fold during an episode of acute cellular rejection compared with levels six months after resolution of the episode. Further, miR-122 levels rose earlier than aminotransferases during the event of rejection, suggesting a role for such biomarkers in the earlier diagnosis of rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, it must be emphasized that these markers are still investigational, are not widely available, and are nonspecific, so liver histology is still required to establish the diagnosis of acute cellular rejection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">LIVER BIOPSY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liver histology remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of acute cellular rejection. Despite its utility, liver biopsy carries a small risk of complications in liver transplantation recipients. One study found a 1.8 percent rate of significant complications after each biopsy in this setting, including an increased rate of sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In another report, infectious complications of liver biopsy were associated with the presence of biliary strictures and biliary anastomosis by choledochojejunostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>There are three major histologic features associated with cellular rejection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80063%7EGAST%2F60368%7EGAST%2F79840\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80063 graphicRef60368 graphicRef79840 \">picture 1A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the portal triad</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Destructive or nondestructive nonsuppurative cholangitis involving interlobular bile duct epithelium</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endotheliitis</p><p/><p>The adequacy of any particular biopsy is ultimately left to the judgment of the pathologist. An international consensus document recommended examination of at least two hematoxylin and eosin stained sections from at least two different levels of a core needle biopsy containing at least five portal triads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The portal tract infiltrate is predominantly mononuclear but may also contain neutrophils and eosinophils. Some investigators have stressed the relative importance of eosinophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsuppurative cholangitis may be destructive or nondestructive, and this feature is important for the prognosis of rejection. The affected ducts are surrounded by immunocytes, which may also be found between epithelial cells, inside the basement membrane, or even in the lumen. Neutrophils may be part of the rejection process but have to be distinguished from the suppurative cholangitis seen in ascending infections. The clinical and radiologic features should distinguish nonsuppurative from suppurative cholangitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endotheliitis or phlebitis (venulitis) is diagnostically the <strong>most reliable</strong> sign of rejection in the appropriate clinical setting. However, it can be fleeting, particularly after the administration of steroid boluses. This lesion is characterized by the attachment of lymphocytes and other immunocytes to the luminal surface of the endothelium. The inflammatory process may affect only a small segment of the cross-section of the vessel. Lymphocytes also aggregate under the damaged endothelium, which is then lifted from the basement membrane.</p><p/><p>Acute cellular rejection may also be associated with inflammatory infiltrates (mostly T-cells) in sinusoids, hepatocanalicular cholestasis, and apoptosis. Centrilobular necrosis is considered a marker of severe rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. More recent immunohistochemical observations suggest that antibody-mediated rejection is associated with positive C4d staining in those with acute cellular rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>In a conference held in Banff, Canada in the summer of 1995, a panel of experts in liver transplantation convened for the purpose of developing a consensus system for the grading of acute liver allograft rejection that was scientifically correct, simple, reproducible, and clinically useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The panel agreed on a common nomenclature, a set of histopathologic criteria for grading acute rejection, and a preferred method of reporting. After the global assessment of rejection, three specific features (portal inflammation, bile duct inflammation, and venular inflammation) are more critically evaluated and scored on a scale of 0 to 3.</p><p>The three scores are added to arrive at a final rejection activity index (RAI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74243\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74243 \">table 1</a>), similar to the scoring system developed for chronic hepatitis. Although there is no clear-cut consensus, an RAI of &le;4 is considered mild acute rejection. While the Banff schema provides an indicator of the presence and severity of acute cellular rejection, a large retrospective analysis found that the RAI score did not correlate with response to corticosteroids or graft survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of liver transplantation dysfunction depends in part upon the time at which it occurs. Within the first few days after transplantation, abnormal liver tests may reflect technical or functional problems, such as hepatic artery thrombosis, preservation injury, biliary anastomosis leakage or stenosis, primary graft nonfunction, or even consequences of shock and septicemia. Although many of these problems may be evident clinically or on imaging such as Doppler ultrasonography, the biopsy findings may sometimes be the first sign of a problem.</p><p>We routinely obtain both a Doppler ultrasound and a liver biopsy on the same day when a transplantation recipient presents with hepatic dysfunction. There are no universal data on the relative frequency of the different causes of hepatic dysfunction at different times and there may be an important center-specific component. As an example, centers that routinely accept older donor organs tend to see an increased incidence of functional cholestasis.</p><p>Other causes of liver allograft dysfunction that may be seen later in the post-transplantation period include cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus infections, recurrent hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, drug-induced liver injury, functional cholestasis, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> toxicity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83412\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83412 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent hepatitis C virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some histologic features, such as bile duct injury and portal lymphocytic infiltration, are found in both recurrent HCV infection and acute cellular rejection. The diagnosis and management of recurrent HCV infection following liver transplantation is discussed separately (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recurrence of hepatitis C virus infection following liver transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Functional cholestasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functional cholestasis is a unique entity that typically occurs in the early post-transplantation period. This form of cholestasis is independent of rejection, parenteral nutrition, or the use of specific drugs. Subcellular organelle damage produced by cold ischemia may play an etiologic role, leading to bile flow dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Liver histology shows cholestasis in zones 2 and 3 and may be associated with ballooning of the hepatocytes in these areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cyclosporine toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> toxicity is an occasional cause of hepatic allograft dysfunction. It should be suspected when abnormal liver tests are seen in conjunction with otherwise unexplained elevations in serum creatinine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cyclosporine and tacrolimus nephrotoxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Massive hemorrhagic necrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A rare complication after liver transplantation is acute graft necrosis and failure in the absence of vascular obstruction. Histologic features include widespread hemorrhage and infarction. This syndrome has been described as massive hemorrhagic necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Alloimmune hemolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another immunologic event that can occur after liver transplantation is massive hemolysis with a graft that is ABO-compatible but nonidentical. In this situation, the recipient might be blood group A, B, or AB. Implantation of a blood group O liver in blood group A or B recipients or a blood group A, B, or even O liver in blood group AB recipients leads to antibody production against the A <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> B antigens on the host red cells. This is followed by massive hemolysis with a rapid fall in hemoglobin and a rapid rise in serum bilirubin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. This phenomenon occurs around the 7th to the 10th postoperative day and is usually self-limited. Knowledge about the graft and recipient blood groups should enable a correct and early diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THE PATIENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient with hepatic allograft dysfunction often presents with liver test abnormalities. In this setting, ultrasonography should be performed to assess hepatic artery and portal vein blood flow, and to detect biliary tract abnormalities. Blood tests for cytomegalovirus antigen, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B virus DNA, hepatitis C virus RNA, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> concentration should be obtained. If biliary tract abnormalities are found or are suspected because of a history of biliary tract problems, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography should be performed; otherwise, a liver biopsy should be obtained to assess graft abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-endoscopy-in-biliary-complications-after-liver-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of endoscopy in biliary complications after liver transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are limited data to support screening liver biopsies in patients who have normal liver tests. However, protocol biopsies are performed at arbitrary intervals at some centers.</p><p>A final caveat is that most of the disorders post-transplantation patients are susceptible to are not mutually exclusive. The liver biopsy, for example, may show evidence of coexisting disorders; furthermore, treatments for these disorders may be directly contradictory. In this setting, treatment is usually aimed at the disorder thought to be most important; the patient is then carefully monitored to assess the response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65599053\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite improvements in immunosuppressive therapy, hepatic allograft rejection remains an important cause of morbidity and late graft loss in patients undergoing liver transplantation.
