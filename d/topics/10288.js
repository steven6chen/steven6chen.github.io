Severe undernutrition is primarily a problem in resource-limited countries. Globally, childhood stunting decreased from 39.7 percent in 1990 to 23.2 percent in 2015, and is expected to decline further [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, the trends vary by region: stunting rates in Asia have shown dramatic declines but have continued to increase in Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Severe undernutrition is uncommon in the United States. </p><p>In this topic review we use the term &quot;malnutrition&quot; in its traditional sense, referring to <strong>undernutrition</strong> (wasting, stunting, or micronutrient deficiencies), although some authors use the term more broadly, to encompass <span class=\"nowrap\">overnutrition/obesity</span>. </p><p>The major forms of malnutrition are marasmus (wasting) and kwashiorkor (edematous malnutrition), with or without associated stunting. The clinical assessment of the child with malnutrition includes distinguishing between these types, assessing their severity, and identifying acute life-threatening complications, including sepsis and acute dehydration. These children are at risk for micronutrient deficiencies, as detailed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=micronutrient-deficiencies-associated-with-malnutrition-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Micronutrient deficiencies associated with malnutrition in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Treatment of severe malnutrition is discussed separately.

Other features include reduced physical activity, mental apathy, and retarded psychomotor and mental development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1796949416\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE MALNUTRITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is associated with one of two classical syndromes: marasmus (wasting syndrome) and kwashiorkor (edematous malnutrition), or a combination of the two (marasmic kwashiorkor). Children with acute malnutrition appear wasted (or show a decrease in mid-upper arm circumference [MUAC], weight-for-length, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> body mass index), whereas children with chronic malnutrition have stunted linear growth <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> are underweight. Malnourished children may also suffer from numerous associated complications, including dehydration, infection, and vitamin deficiencies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78426\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78426 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H232044762\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for comorbid conditions'</a> below and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Specific nutrient deficiencies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H421760048\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical subtypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SAM can be divided into clinical subtypes based on the presence or absence of edema. Malnutrition without edema is known as marasmus or wasting, and malnutrition with edema is known as kwashiorkor (or edematous malnutrition). Distinguishing physical features are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111603\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111603 \">table 2</a>). In the past, children with kwashiorkor were previously thought to have worse outcomes compared with those with marasmus, but more recent large studies demonstrate that children with kwashiorkor tend to have better outcomes, perhaps due to the additional burden of higher rates of human immunodeficiency virus&nbsp;(HIV) and diarrheal dehydration among those with marasmus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Marasmus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Marasmus is characterized by <strong>low weight-for-height</strong> and <strong>reduced MUAC</strong>, reflecting wasting of muscle mass and depletion of body fat stores.

In children with marasmus, cardiac output and stroke volume are reduced in proportion to the loss of lean body mass; hence, cardiac index (which relates cardiac output to body surface area) is normal. However, there is a threshold beyond which cardiac dysfunction occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver &ndash; Hepatomegaly from fatty liver is common, especially in kwashiorkor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Hepatic gluconeogenesis is reduced in patients with hypoalbuminemia, which increases the risk of hypoglycemia, and energy production from substrates such as galactose and fructose is also impaired. There is severely reduced hepatic metabolism and excretion of toxins, as well as reduced hepatic synthesis of proteins including albumin and production of abnormal metabolites of amino acids. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genitourinary system &ndash; Glomerular filtration rate is reduced, and the capacity of the kidney to excrete sodium, excess acid, or a water load is greatly reduced. Urinary tract infections are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal tract &ndash; Production of gastric acid is reduced. The pancreas is atrophied and its production of digestive enzymes is reduced. The mucosa of the small intestine is atrophied and production of digestive enzymes and membrane nutrient transporters is reduced. Lactase deficiency is common and absorption of all nutrients is reduced. Intestinal motility is reduced and this can be worsened by potassium and magnesium deficiencies, potentially leading to ileus. Luminal bacterial overgrowth is common and the gut barrier function against translocation of bacteria and their toxins is diminished, which can in turn lead to bacteremia and sepsis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune system &ndash; Immune dysfunction and infections are closely associated with malnutrition and are probably both a cause and consequence of malnutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Severely malnourished children are at extremely high risk for superimposed infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Multiple immune functions are diminished in marasmus. Lymph glands, tonsils, and the thymus are atrophied. Cell-mediated (T-cell) immunity, immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels in secretions, complement levels, and phagocytosis are all diminished. Although the acute phase immune response is intact, the typical signs of infection, such as leukocytosis and fever, are frequently absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Septic shock is often associated with hypoglycemia and hypothermia (see <a href=\"#H2915043724\" class=\"local\">'Sepsis'</a> below). Other inflammatory mediators (including Interleukin 6 [IL6], C-reactive protein) are increased, particularly in kwashiorkor (edematous malnutrition) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endocrine system &ndash; Insulin levels are reduced and the child may be glucose intolerant. Growth hormone levels are increased but levels of its downstream effector, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), are reduced. Cortisol levels are usually increased.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolism and circulation &ndash; The basal metabolic rate is reduced by about 30 percent but rises markedly during the recovery period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Both heat generation and heat loss are impaired so that the child becomes hypothermic in a cold environment and hyperthermic in a hot environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Intestinal absorption of nutrients and blood glucose clearance are reduced in edematous malnutrition and marasmus, but endogenous glucose production is significantly reduced in children with hypoalbuminemia, with or without edematous malnutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cellular function &ndash; Sodium pump activity is reduced and cell membranes are more permeable than normal, resulting in an increase in intracellular sodium and a decrease in intracellular potassium and magnesium. Protein synthesis is reduced.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin and glands &ndash; The skin and subcutaneous fat are atrophied, which causes loose skin folds. Many signs of dehydration are unreliable. As examples, the eyes may appear sunken because of loss of subcutaneous fat in the orbit, and the child may have dryness of mouth and eyes, and reduced sweat production because of atrophied sweat, tear, and salivary glands. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Distinguishing sepsis from dehydration'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87025865\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple theories have been advanced to explain the edema in edematous malnutrition: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protein <span class=\"nowrap\">deficiency/hypoalbuminemia</span> &ndash; In the past, dietary protein deficiency was thought to be the key factor underlying edematous malnutrition. This assumption was based on observations that many patients with kwashiorkor have hypoalbuminemia, which was thought to be a consequence of inadequate nutrients for protein synthesis. In addition, albumin concentrations generally increase within the first two weeks of refeeding (albeit subtly), and edematous malnutrition has features similar to congenital nephrotic syndrome, in which the primary pathology is renal loss of albumin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, multiple lines of evidence have shown that inadequate intake of dietary protein is <strong>not</strong> the primary trigger for edematous malnutrition. As examples, some patients have edematous malnutrition without hypoalbuminemia; others develop edematous malnutrition despite adequate proportion of protein in the diet (eg, in exclusively breastfed infants); and others recover from edematous malnutrition with supportive care even without enhancing the protein content of the diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thus, neither protein deficiency nor hypoalbuminemia appear to be the primary cause of the edema in kwashiorkor. Instead, hypoalbuminemia appears to be a common complication and may contribute to the edema in many patients by permitting movement of fluid from the vascular space into the interstitium; this is compounded by retention of sodium and water by the kidneys. The carbohydrate component of the diet increases insulin levels, which further enhances renal reabsorption of sodium and water. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-edema-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of edema in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxidant stress &ndash; Excessive oxidant stress has been proposed as a cause of edematous malnutrition. However, a trial to prevent this form of malnutrition with antioxidant supplementation was not successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], leading to the conclusion that antioxidant depletion may be a consequence rather than a cause of kwashiorkor. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microbiome &ndash; Emerging evidence suggests that edematous malnutrition is caused by changes in the intestinal microbiome, in conjunction with a specific diet. In one study, malnutrition was induced in mice by transfer of the fecal microbiota from malnourished children if they were also fed the local nutrient-poor diet eaten by the children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Neither the fecal microbiota transfer nor the local diet alone was sufficient to cause the malnutrition. This and other studies support the concept that changes in fecal microbiota <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> virome observed in malnutrition are causes rather than effects of edematous malnutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. Severe malnutrition may interfere with the normal development of the intestinal microbiome, leading to an immature bacterial population that could potentially lead to other health consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/32,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,36</a>]. Further studies are required to understand the mechanisms through which the microbiome might contribute to the development of edematous malnutrition, particularly alterations in micronutrient metabolism or toxin removal in the gut, possibly adding to the proposed state of oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ASSESSMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H645092315\"><span class=\"h2\">Anthropometrics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree of acute and chronic malnutrition, manifested as wasting or edema, and linear stunting, respectively, is assessed clinically using various anthropometric measurements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60869\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60869 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The assessment methods are based upon the assumption that during periods of nutritional deprivation, weight deficits occur initially, followed by faltering length or height and, finally, by lagging head circumference growth. Estimates of the severity and duration of nutritional deprivation provide guidelines for the nutritional rehabilitation of the malnourished child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H307139008\"><span class=\"h3\">Z-scores</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The severity of wasting or stunting is defined by comparing a child's weight and height measurements with those of a population reference standard.

(See <a href=\"#H421760048\" class=\"local\">'Clinical subtypes'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Marasmus is characterized by the wasting of muscle mass and the depletion of body fat stores. It is the most common form of protein-energy malnutrition and is caused by inadequate intake of all nutrients, but especially dietary energy sources (total calories). Affected children usually have some degree of stunting (suggesting chronic malnutrition), as well as wasting. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Marasmus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Kwashiorkor (edematous malnutrition) is characterized by peripheral or generalized edema, with marked muscle atrophy with normal or increased body fat. Because any degree of edema in a malnourished child significantly worsens the child's prognosis, kwashiorkor is by definition severe malnutrition. Affected children usually have hepatomegaly and may have anorexia, dermatoses, and hair changes. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Kwashiorkor (edematous malnutrition)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Children with either type of malnutrition are at risk for secondary infections, and are at risk for fluid overload. (See <a href=\"#H25698054\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Criteria for admission and discharge from nutrition rehabilitation programs depend upon anthropometry and the child's appetite and clinical condition, or anthropometry alone for infants younger than six months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111414%7EPEDS%2F111413\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef111414 graphicRef111413 \">algorithm 1A-B</a>). A summary of the history and physical examination that should be used in the assessment of a malnourished child is presented in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111372%7EPEDS%2F111373\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111372 graphicRef111373 \">table 4A-B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4008534886\" class=\"local\">'Admission and discharge criteria'</a> above and <a href=\"#H232044762\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for comorbid conditions'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute malnutrition typically causes wasting (with reduced weight-for-length), while chronic malnutrition causes both wasting and stunting (with reduced height-for-age). The severity of the malnutrition can be categorized based on mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> standard deviations below the population mean (Z-scores) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60869\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60869 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with malnutrition should be evaluated for sepsis and severe dehydration. Both sepsis and severe dehydration cause poor tissue perfusion with weak pulses, cold hands and feet, and reduced urine flow. Children with dehydration tend to be thirsty, have a history of diarrhea, and may have sunken eyes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72642\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72642 \">table 6</a>). Specific signs of septic shock include hypothermia and lack of thirst (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63299\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63299 \">table 5</a>). The features of dehydration and shock often overlap, particularly in advanced stages, so empiric treatment for both disorders is often appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Distinguishing sepsis from dehydration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In malnourished children, skin turgor is not always a reliable measure of hydration status. Skin turgor may give the false appearance of dehydration in children with marasmus because of absent subcutaneous fat, or the false appearance of normal hydration in children with kwashiorkor because of edema. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for dehydration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malnourished children usually have deficiencies of specific micronutrients, particularly vitamins A and D, folate, and iron, which are sometimes associated with specific clinical symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63827\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63827 \">table 7</a>). In addition, they are deficient in one or more nutrients required for growth, including protein, electrolytes, and zinc. Vitamin and mineral supplements are routinely included in nutritional rehabilitation protocols. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Specific nutrient deficiencies'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=micronutrient-deficiencies-associated-with-malnutrition-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Micronutrient deficiencies associated with malnutrition in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of complicated severe acute malnutrition in children in resource-limited countries&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H219872418\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Buford L Nichols, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Black RE, Victora CG, Walker SP, et al.
