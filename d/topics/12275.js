Vein-related problems may or may not be symptomatic and include a wide range of clinical signs that vary from minimal superficial venous dilation to chronic skin changes with ulceration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H333597404\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inadequate muscle pump function, incompetent venous valves (reflux), and venous thrombosis or obstruction are causes of elevated venous pressure (venous hypertension), which initiates a sequence of anatomic, physiologic, and histologic changes leading to vein dilation, skin changes, or skin ulceration. The factors that determine whether a given patient will progress from mild to more severe disease are largely unknown. The pathophysiology of chronic venous disease is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-chronic-venous-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of chronic venous disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome#H234405781\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-thrombotic (postphlebitic) syndrome&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic vein abnormalities are present in up to 50 percent of individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. However, estimates of prevalence rates of chronic venous disease vary depending upon the population studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Epidemiologic studies typically focus on defined subsets based upon the visible manifestations of venous disease. Study populations are generally limited to either those with mild abnormalities (telangiectasias, reticular veins), uncomplicated varicose veins with or without venous reflux, or longstanding venous insufficiency (ie, skin changes, venous ulceration). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p>While it is convenient to stratify the study of venous abnormalities in this manner, it is important to remember that these subsets represent varying levels of disease severity in a spectrum of a single pathology; risk factors for development are the same.

Compared with other levels of venous disease severity, these less severe venous abnormalities (ie, telangiectasias and reticular veins) are the most prevalent, occurring in the absence of more significant abnormalities (eg, varicose veins, venous ulcer) in 50 to 66 percent of individuals, depending upon the population studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>].

It is estimated that six to seven million people in the United States are affected at a given time. Since venous ulceration can be recurrent as well as chronic, studies of point prevalence tend to underestimate the number of cases. Point prevalence estimates of venous ulceration in Western nations range from 0.02 to 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/20,21,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21,23,24</a>], while the period prevalence is higher, between 1 and 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/14,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,23</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Chronic venous insufficiency, ulceration, and symptoms attributable to venous disease may be twice as common in women; however, results may be influenced by female longevity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/20,21,23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21,23,25</a>]. In one population sample, the rate of moderate disease was twice as high among women as men, but the rate of severe disease was higher in men than women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Men who worked as laborers had higher rates of severe disease compared with nonlaborers. This same study found no ethnic differences for prevalence of moderate disease, but severe disease may be less common in African-American women. Other studies suggest that African-American patients may present with more advanced venous insufficiency and may have slower postprocedural ulcer healing times but also higher ulcer recurrence rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk factors for the development of chronic venous disease include advancing age, family history of venous disease, ligamentous laxity (eg, hernia, flat feet), prolonged standing, increased body mass index, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, lower extremity trauma, prior venous thrombosis (superficial or deep), the presence of an arteriovenous shunt, some hereditary conditions (eg, Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome), high estrogen states, and pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/5,6,10,29-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,10,29-41</a>]. The proportion of the population suffering from obesity and chronic venous insufficiency is increasing, and obese patients are more likely to be symptomatic as a result of their venous disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Despite the well-known association, a history of deep venous thrombosis is obtained in less than one-third of patients with severe clinical manifestations of chronic venous disease (ie, edema, ulcer, inflammation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/23,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,43,44</a>]. Duplex ultrasound in these patients may identify valvular insufficiency, chronic vein wall thickening, or chronic thrombosis indicative of post-thrombotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>].

In a case-control study of 67 patients and their parents, the risk for varicose veins was 90 percent when both parents were affected, 25 percent for men and 62 percent for women when one parent was affected, and 20 percent if neither parent had varicose veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Prevalence rates appear to be lower in non-Western populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Based upon these observations, it is widely thought that factors related to Western lifestyle such as prolonged standing and sitting increase the likelihood of the development of chronic venous disease. However, a large, population-based study in Scotland that examined multiple potential risk factors found no consistent relationship between varicose veins and these lifestyle risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Other venous conditions can contribute to the development of venous abnormalities and include venous wall degeneration (ie, venous aneurysm), arteriovenous shunts (eg, traumatic), and nonthrombotic iliac vein obstruction (eg, May-Thurner syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].

Disease progression and increasing severity of symptoms appear to be related to the extent of venous valvular incompetence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/10,11,25,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,25,51,52</a>]. Varicose veins tend to remain more stable in the absence of truncal (saphenous) or deep venous reflux. In an observational study that followed 73 patients, the asymptomatic limb contralateral to the limb undergoing varicose vein surgery developed varicose veins in approximately one-half of the patients over a five-year follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>The Framingham Study examined men and women for the presence of varicose veins every two years over a 16-year period. Over this time, 396 of 1720 men (23 percent) and 629 of 2102 women (30 percent) who were initially free from the condition developed varicose veins. However, the presence or absence of venous reflux was not evaluated. The two-year incidence of varicose veins was, on average, 39.4 per 1000 for men and 51.9 per 1000 for women. The incidence was highest in women 40 to 49 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Selected markers of inflammation may predict disease severity and progression. In a study of 80 patients, the serum fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio was found to be a sensitive and specific marker (75 and 87.5 percent, respectively) for CEAP (Clinical, Etiologic, Anatomic, Pathophysiologic) clinical classification for the determination of disease severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio was also a predictor disease progression. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lower extremity chronic venous disorders encompass an entire spectrum of morphologic and functional abnormalities of the venous system. Symptoms include pain, leg heaviness or aching, swelling, dry skin, tightness, skin irritation, heaviness, muscle cramps, and itching. Clinical signs include dilated veins, edema, lipodermatosclerosis (a fibrosing dermatitis of the subcutaneous tissue), or ulceration.

It is important to note that such treatment does not prevent the future development of venous reflux and the occurrence of chronic venous disease. Sclerotherapy and surface laser of telangiectasias and reticular veins are generally considered cosmetic treatments and are not typically covered by insurance, though occasionally sclerotherapy will be reimbursed for treating veins that have hemorrhaged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H703320091\" class=\"local\">'Venous reflux associated with symptoms'</a> below and <a href=\"#H703319223\" class=\"local\">'Sclerotherapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H703319251\" class=\"local\">'Thermal ablation'</a> below.)</p><p>The presence of reflux increases recurrence rates of dilated veins that have been treated, and thus, superficial or perforator reflux, if it is present, should be treated prior to treating telangiectasias and reticular veins. Following successful ablation of the great saphenous vein, telangiectasias, telangiectatic matting, reticular veins, and smaller varicosities can become more prominent but usually improve over time. Therefore, delaying treatment of these smaller veins will minimize the number of veins that need treatment. Residual telangiectasias or reticular veins following successful management of venous reflux are also candidates for sclerotherapy or surface laser therapy. </p><p>Sclerotherapy is the preferred initial approach for the treatment of most patients with lower extremity telangiectasias, reticular veins, and small varicose veins. The results for sclerotherapy are generally thought to be superior to those of laser therapy. Thus, laser therapy is generally reserved for needle-phobic patients or those who are allergic to sclerosant agents, have post-sclerotherapy matting, or have failed sclerotherapy. However, the outcome depends upon the diameter of the vein being treated and the presence or absence of underlying reticular veins and skin type.

The various methods of vein ablation are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H703318852\" class=\"local\">'Methods of vein ablation'</a> below.)</p><p>Meta-analyses comparing surgery with minimally invasive therapies (sclerotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, laser ablation) have concluded that minimally invasive therapies appear to be at least as effective as surgical excision, with long-term success rates of 78 to 84 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/62-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-66</a>].

Minimally invasive procedures are generally associated with fewer complications. In one trial, each of the groups showed significant improvements in quality-of-life scores, and 84.3 percent of treated patients had improved CEAP clinical category following treatment, although vein closure rates varied at one year (highest at 88.5 percent for endovenous laser ablation, followed by 88.2 percent for conventional surgery, and 72.2 percent for foam sclerotherapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. </p><p>A later trial involving 798 participants with primary varicose veins compared the outcomes of foam sclerotherapy, laser, and surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Clinical success was similar between the groups, but successful ablation of the main trunks of the saphenous vein was less common for foam sclerotherapy compared with surgery. No significant differences were found for quality of life. The frequency of procedural complications was similar for the foam sclerotherapy and surgery groups (6 and 7 percent, respectively) but was lower in the laser group (1 percent). The frequency of serious adverse events (approximately 3 percent) was similar among the groups. A trial comparing saphenous vein high ligation plus phlebectomy with endovenous laser ablation reported follow-up to five years, at which time there were no significant differences in rates of recurrent varicose veins or reoperation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>A review of randomized trials comparing ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy with endothermal ablation noted that although anatomical success appeared higher with endothermal ablation, clinical success and patient-reported outcome measures were similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Morbidity and complication rates were very low and not significantly different.

The main advantage of performing venous ablation procedures with concomitant treatment is a reduction in the overall treatment time. The advantage of waiting four to six weeks following venous ablation is that the residual veins tend to be smaller and may be more amenable to injection sclerotherapy instead of phlebectomy, and in many cases, no further treatment is needed. This effect is due to reduced venous pressure in the tributaries of the ablated saphenous vein. Large varicose veins and those located on the thigh are less likely to respond to elimination of reflux, and thus, we prefer to manage these concurrently with the ablation procedure.</p><p>Several studies have evaluated the timing of varicose vein treatment in association with endovenous laser ablation (EVLA). One trial randomly assigned 50 patients to EVLA with concomitant phlebectomy or EVLA with sequential phlebectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. The concomitant treatment group required longer operative times, fewer subsequent procedures (1 of 25 versus 16 of 25), and a trend toward longer time to return to work (10 versus 3 days). The concomitant treatment group also had a lower health-related quality of life (HRQOL) at six weeks and three months; however, no differences in HRQOL were seen at one year, and it remained equal at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. It is important to note that in the sequential treatment group, a supplemental procedure was not needed in one-third of the patients. Similarly, a retrospective study of 80 patients treated with EVLA alone found that supplemental treatment was needed in only 42 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. By contrast, in another trial that randomly assigned 101 patients to simultaneous varicose vein phlebectomy or delayed treatment, significantly fewer patients in the simultaneous group required any further treatment (2 versus 36 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. </p><p>A comprehensive review of over 300 limbs treated with EVLA and sequential phlebectomy identified anatomic and clinical factors associated with lack of regression of superficial varicosities following EVLA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. CEAP classification did not affect the need for secondary procedures. An increased likelihood of requiring secondary procedures was found for enlarged (&gt;6 mm) great saphenous vein in the distal thigh, patients with clusters of large (&gt;6 mm)-diameter varicosities, and patients in whom the cosmetic appearance was very important. These patients might benefit from a combined EVLA and phlebectomy performed as a single-stage procedure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H848989939\"><span class=\"h2\">Advanced venous disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with signs and symptoms of edema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56758\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56758 \">picture 3</a>), skin changes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F76901\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76901 \">picture 4</a>), or ulceration (CEAP categories C3, C4, C5 and C6) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71020\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71020 \">picture 5</a>) are initially managed conservatively with elevation, compression therapy, and <span class=\"nowrap\">skin/ulcer</span> care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/77-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-79</a>].

Vein ablation may be necessary to manage hemorrhage, to prevent proximal extension of thrombus from a superficial vein, or to treat recurrent symptoms in patients with superficial vein thrombosis. Although compression therapy is an appropriate first-line treatment to manage symptoms associated with chronic venous disease, it does not provide a definitive treatment of venous insufficiency. However, for many patients, stockings control mild symptoms, avoiding intervention, and most insurance companies require conservative care first. Thus, symptomatic patients are generally treated with conservative measures for a period of time, prior to offering ablation therapy.

However, dilated veins can occur in the absence of symptoms or reflux and are often a source of significant distress to the patient, even in the absence of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H333597404\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic patients with lower extremity telangiectasias, reticular veins, or varicose veins should undergo further evaluation with venous duplex to identify the presence of superficial or deep venous insufficiency, which alters treatment options. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial treatment for most patients with chronic venous disease is conservative and includes leg elevation, exercise, and compression therapy. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Initial conservative measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with persistent symptoms (pain, aching, swelling) and signs (telangiectasias, reticular veins, varicose veins, skin changes, ulceration) of venous disease after a period of conservative management <strong>and</strong> documented reflux as a source of their symptoms are candidates for vein ablation therapy. The goals of treatment are improved symptoms and appearance. (See <a href=\"#H703316837\" class=\"local\">'Vein ablation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that symptomatic patients with telangiectasias, reticular veins, and varicose veins with documented saphenous reflux as a source of their symptoms undergo saphenous ablation before treatment of their associated telangiectasias, reticular veins, or varicose veins, rather than afterward (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Management of saphenous reflux decreases recurrence rates. (See <a href=\"#H3883348561\" class=\"local\">'Telangiectasias and reticular veins'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3369778939\" class=\"local\">'Varicose veins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For lower extremity telangiectasias, reticular veins, and small varicose veins large enough to admit a 27- or 30-gauge needle, we suggest sclerotherapy rather than laser therapy, as an initial treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Sclerotherapy improves clearance of treated veins. (See <a href=\"#H3883348561\" class=\"local\">'Telangiectasias and reticular veins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laser therapy is the only option for treatment of telangiectasias too small to access, patients allergic to sclerosing agents or afraid of needles, or those who have failed sclerotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H3883348561\" class=\"local\">'Telangiectasias and reticular veins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest endovenous ablation techniques (radiofrequency ablation or endovenous laser ablation) for the saphenous and other truncal veins rather than surgical vein stripping (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Endovenous techniques are highly successful in achieving vein closure and have high patient satisfaction rates. (See <a href=\"#H3461128588\" class=\"local\">'Comparison of ablation therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent or recurrent perforators identified by duplex following vein ablation can be managed with ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy or endovenous methods. On occasion, surgical methods may be required for patients with recurrent or refractory venous ulceration.
