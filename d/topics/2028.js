Five human prion diseases are currently recognized: kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), variant CJD (vCJD, also known as new variant CJD), Gerstmann-Str&auml;ussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), and fatal familial insomnia (FFI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), one of a number of prion infections affecting animals, has helped to focus more widespread public attention on these diseases with its possible link to vCJD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>These human prion diseases share certain common neuropathologic features including neuronal loss, proliferation of glial cells, absence of an inflammatory response, and the presence of small vacuoles within the neuropil, which produces a spongiform appearance. Current evidence indicates that prion diseases are associated with the accumulation of an abnormal form of a host cell protein, designated the prion protein (PrP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The biology of prions will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, genetics, and diagnosis of prion diseases are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diseases of the central nervous system caused by prions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=creutzfeldt-jakob-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOLOGY OF PRIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dr. Stanley Prusiner coined the term &quot;prion&quot; in 1982, which he defined as a small infectious pathogen containing protein but apparently lacking nucleic acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The prion protein (PrP) is the critical component of these agents and may, in fact, be its exclusive constituent.</p><p>One of the characteristic features of prions is their resistance to a number of normal decontaminating procedures. These pathogens are resistant to processes affecting nucleic acids, such as hydrolysis or shearing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, agents that digest, denature, or modify proteins do have activity against prions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The PrP purified from the brains of scrapie-infected animals (PrPSc) can be inactivated by prolonged autoclaving (at 121&ordm;C and 15 psi for 4.5 hours), or immersion in 1N NaOH (for 30 minutes, repeat three times), or immersion in concentrated (&gt;3 M) solutions of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guanidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">guanidine</a> thiocyanate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, certain cautions prevail; it appears that inadequate autoclaving can establish heat-resistant subpopulations that fail to diminish with a further cycle of autoclaving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Stainless steel instruments also may retain infectivity even after treatment with 10 percent formaldehyde [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Newer decontamination techniques are being investigated. There has been some success in sterilization using a combination of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), proteinase K, and pronase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A radio-frequency gas-plasma treatment has been shown to effectively decontaminate surgical instruments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Another group has tested a decontamination formula combining copper metal ions with hydrogen peroxide&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Prion protein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scrapie prions have been used as a model for prion diseases. PrPSc is a conformational isomer of PrPC, a membrane-bound glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored protein found in the brains of normal animals on both neuronal and non-neuronal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Similar proteins are also found in yeast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The normal function of PrPC is unknown. A number of studies have shown that the PrP is capable of reversibly binding to copper ions, suggesting that the PrP could play a role in copper homeostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/3,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20</a>]. Copper itself plays a role in endocytosis and neurotransmission. Furthermore, PrPC acts as a mediator of copper superoxide dismutase involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>], and it may play a role in regulating apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. PrPC is also expressed throughout the cells of the immune system, red blood cells, and platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. One study found that PrP was upregulated during T cell activation and that antibody crosslinking of surface PrP led to increased phosphorylation of signaling proteins, suggesting a role for PrPC in immune function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>PrPC exists primarily in an alpha helical conformation, while PrPSc is beta helical and appears to result from a yet uncharacterized conformational alteration in PrPC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Recombinant forms of PrP show a large unstructured protein motif, which may more easily convert to a beta structure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. The PrPSc molecules form amyloid fibrils, which show apple-green birefringence upon polarization after Congo red staining. The fibrils are made of a continuous array of beta sheets that are oriented perpendicular to the fibril axis. The resistance of PrPSc to digestion with proteases and its tendency to polymerize into scrapie-associated fibrils or prion rods differentiates PrPSc from PrPC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. The hydrophobicity of this protein, which may in turn affect aggregation, and its beta-sheet conformation may play a role in neurotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Biosynthesis of PrPC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A key step during the biosynthesis of PrPC involves modification of both the amino and carboxy terminals with the addition of a phosphatidylinositol glycolipid, which serves to anchor the protein to the cell surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/18,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,34</a>]. PrPC can be detected attached to the plasma membrane of neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] and may be concentrated at synaptic membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In addition, PrPC also has transmembrane domains, indicating that it spans the cellular cytoplasmic membrane. Surface PrPC is degraded after endocytosis in acidic vesicles, although some protein may recycle to the cell surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Secreted forms of PrPC also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>In vitro studies have shown the importance of glycosylation in the formation of PrPSc. Changes in electrophoretic mobility are linked to different phenotypic presentations of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). These changes are due to both variation in amino acid sequence as well as glycosylation of the PrP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Furthermore, infectivity across the species barrier is enhanced when unglycosylated forms of the PrP are used, and conversion of PrPC to PrPSc is inhibited by glycosylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Conversion of PrPC to PrPSc</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to PrPC, PrPSc accumulates within cells and does not normally appear on the cell surface. PrPSc is found predominantly in cytoplasmic vacuoles and secondary lysosomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Conversion of PrPC to PrPSc may occur in caveolae-like membranous domains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Studies in mice either devoid of PrPC or with abnormal isoforms indicate that host PrPC must be present for the development of prion disease. Prion diseases appear to result from accumulation of abnormal isoforms of the PrP, which is dependent upon conversion of normal PrPC into PrPSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. This conversion appears to be the result of a conformational change in PrPC, rather than a chemical modification.</p><p>One group developed a peptide, iPrP13, that can break a beta-sheet conformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. This peptide was able to reduce the protease resistance of PrPSc and to delay the onset of symptoms in transmission experiments in mice. It has been hypothesized that another as yet unidentified host factor, designated protein X, may facilitate conversion of normal PrP to PrPSc by binding to the carboxy terminus of PrPC and interacting with a site near the N-terminus of the protein to effect a conformational change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Another study used transgenic mice with an abnormal form of PrPC lacking the glycophospholipid cell membrane anchor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. When inoculated with PrPSc, these mice accumulated abnormal PrP in abundant amyloid plaques but were asymptomatic and did not accumulate PrPSc or develop titers of infectivity at nearly the same rate as wild-type mice. The PrP membrane anchor appears necessary in the pathogenesis of prion disease. This study also emphasizes the specific neurotoxic role of PrPSc beyond amyloid deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>How the first molecule of PrPSc appears in the host remains a mystery, but the initial appearance, which may be de novo, probably triggers the replication of PrPSc. This process has been compared to crystallization in solution where a single seed crystal serves as a nidus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is hypothesized that the initiating PrPSc molecule is derived from an exogenous source in sporadic and iatrogenic prion diseases, while mutations are invariably detected within the gene encoding PrP in familial forms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. These mutations could destabilize PrPC, which might lead to spontaneous conversion to PrPSc. Studies of yeast prion Sup53 have shown that small, specific elements of the primary amino acid sequence are responsible for initial nucleation as well as for specific prion conformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Possible role for immune response in early pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to transport to the nervous system, follicular dendritic cells within germinal centers of lymphoid tissue appear to act as a reservoir for the protein. Two reports suggest that complement plays a role in early pathogenesis. Mice deficient in C3 or C1q had decreased stores of PrPSc in the spleen and delayed onset of neurologic disease following peripheral inoculation in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. A companion report showed partial or full protection against spongiform encephalopathy in mice deficient in C3, C1q, <span class=\"nowrap\">Bf/C2,</span> or complement receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Other studies have shown variable immune responses to different experimental conformations of the PrP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Transport of PrPSc to the nervous system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transport of PrPSc to the nervous system, once it appears in the host, occurs via axons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Previous investigations suggested that the predominant mechanism was by slow axoplasmic transport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. However, several studies provide data showing that rapid anterograde axonal transport also occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. In one of these reports, a specific isoform of the protein was transported via this route in a hamster model, compared with several other isoforms found within neural tissues, which appeared to arrive by a slower transport mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>The finding of PrPC and PrPSc in olfactory sensory neurons has suggested that the olfactory system may serve as an entry pathway for infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. However, the lymphoreticular system appears to play the more critical role in the initiation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> propagation of some prion diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. Studies in mice indicate that for some prion diseases acquired by inoculation (including intranasal inoculation), a period of replication in lymphoreticular tissue is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/60,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,62</a>]. Other studies found PrPSc expressed in the spleens of mice that were inoculated with prion disease directly into the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Splenectomized mice developed prion disease more slowly than nonsplenectomized mice after intracerebral inoculation. Involvement of the lymphoreticular system seems more likely for certain types of exogenously acquired prion diseases, such as iatrogenic CJD (iCJD), kuru, and perhaps variant CJD (vCJD), than for sporadic and genetic forms of prion diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurotoxicity of prion protein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PrPSc appears to be neurotoxic; accumulation of this protein or fragments of it in neurons leads to apoptosis and cell death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. As an example, the PrP fragment containing amino acids 106 to 126 induces death of hippocampal neurons following exposure in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. PrPC must be present for this effect to occur; PrP106-126 does not destroy neurons in mice that do not express PrPC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. However, abnormal PrP released by astrocytes still destroys PrP-negative neurons in mice, suggesting that the neuronal injury is not caused by a loss of function of normal neuronal PrP or any interaction between normal and abnormal forms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>Misfolded PrP is transported in a retrograde fashion to the cytosol for degradation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Even small amounts of this protein in the cytosol are highly neurotoxic, and this accumulation may be an important step in prion disease pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Demonstration of PrPSc</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunohistochemistry techniques such as ELISA have been used to detect the presence and levels of disease-causing PrPSc in human brain tissue at autopsy or in biopsy samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. These methods use limited proteolysis to hydrolyze the normal precursor cellular PrPC in order to measure the protease-resistant core of the pathologic PrPSc. Subsequently, the conformation-dependent immunoassay (CDI) method was developed that did not require proteolysis to digest PrPC, and it was discovered that PrPSc exists in both protease-resistant and protease-sensitive forms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Thus, unlike other immunoassays, the CDI is able to measure both protease-resistant and protease-sensitive forms of PrPSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>CDI appears to have a much higher sensitivity for the diagnosis of sporadic CJD (sCJD) disease compared with routine neuropathologic examination and immunohistochemistry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. While this method appears promising, further study is needed to determine its specificity as well as its role in other human prion diseases, particularly vCJD, and its possible antemortem diagnostic utility in brain biopsy and extraneural tissue specimens.</p><p>Another promising method is one that amplifies PrP in blood by a process called protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. This technique may enable later detection with a variety of methods. A study by the same group of investigators showed that this method could detect a biphasic appearance of PrPSc in inoculated hamsters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. PrPSc was detected in approximately one-half of asymptomatic animals three to six weeks postinoculation. The signal subsequently disappeared, and then reappeared four months postinoculation when the hamsters became symptomatic. This method may become useful in assessing asymptomatic blood donors.</p><p>Antibodies that uniquely react with PrPSc may provide a diagnostic method for prion disease. Investigators have described a repeat Tyr-Tyr-Arg epitope that is hidden in PrPC but becomes accessible in PrPSc following the misfolding process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies raised to this moiety react with scrapie-infected mouse and hamster brain tissue and not with normal brain tissue, which raises the possibility that these antibodies might serve as diagnostic test reagents. Other methods are also in development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/74-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-79</a>]. The need for a highly sensitive and specific test to detect PrPSc will increase when effective treatment for human prion disease becomes available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS OF HUMAN PRION DISEASES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gene encoding prion protein (<em>PRNP</em>) in humans is located on the short arm of chromosome 20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. A strong link was established between mutations in the <em>PRNP</em> gene and forms of prion disease with a familial predisposition (familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [fCJD], Gerstmann-Str&auml;ussler-Scheinker syndrome [GSS], fatal familial insomnia [FFI]). More than 50 different mutations have been identified, including point and premature stop codon mutations as well as the insertion of octapeptide repeats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>]. Some experts have advocated classifying prion diseases based upon the responsible mutation rather than the traditional classifications such as fCJD or GSS since a single mutation can produce different clinical phenotypes in different individuals or families (ie, genetic pleiotropy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/80,83-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,83-85</a>]. As an example, the D178N mutation, in which asparagine substitutes for aspartic acid in codon 178, occurs in families with FFI, fCJD, and GSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Pedigrees with this mutation often demonstrate marked variability in the age of onset as well as the disease phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. A large English and Irish kindred has been described containing individuals diagnosed with a variety of conditions including CJD, variant CJD (vCJD), and GSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. However, when the <em>PRNP</em> gene was examined, all affected individuals had a valine-for-alanine substitution at codon 117 regardless of the clinical diagnosis.</p><p>Codon 129 of the <em>PRNP</em> gene is a polymorphic codon; normal individuals have either valine or methionine at that site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/86-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">86-89</a>]. Neither V129 nor M129 appears to be pathogenic itself. However, genotype-phenotype correlation studies suggest that amino acid 129 allele status modifies the effect of other pathogenic <em>PRNP</em> mutations. The modifying influence appears to be a cis-acting effect, meaning that the impact on phenotype is due to the presence of both variants in the same protein product. The effect is likely a result of the joint effect of both variants together on conferring a unique conformational change in protein structure, resulting in altered patterns of <em>PRNP</em> cleavage by proteases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Patients with the D178N mutation who are homozygous for valine at codon 129 appear to develop CJD, while those who are homozygous for methionine tend to have FFI. In another kindred prion protein (PrP) gene, polymorphism was found to influence the age of disease onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Despite these patterns, the clinical expression of individual mutations can vary even between affected members of the same family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p><em>PRNP</em> point mutations appear to influence the glycoform ratios and conformation of PrPSc; while these can differ among patients with the same inherited mutation, they are distinct from PrPSc seen in sporadic, iatrogenic, and variant CJD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This may indicate that strain variation is a composite of both abnormal conformation and glycosylation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Familial CJD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In fCJD, a missense mutation involving the substitution of lysine for glutamine in codon 200 is the most common <em>PRNP</em> gene mutation, and this has been observed in many regions, including from Libya, Chile, and Hungary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/91-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">91-93</a>]. In Slovakia, this mutation underlies more than 70 percent of all prion diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. One study described a differing presentation of this syndrome with codon 129 phenotype changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. When the mutant codon 200 was linked to a valine at codon 129, PrP deposits were observed in the cerebellum and the PrP was resistant to type 2 protease, neither of which feature has been described with methionine at codon 129.</p><p>The clinical features of the V180I mutation in <em>PRNP</em> associated with fCJD were described in 186 Japanese patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. CJD in these patients was characterized by more slowly progressive dementia than other sporadic and genetic CJD variants and was more likely to occur later in life. Because myoclonus, visual disturbance, and cerebellar and pyramidal signs occur at lower frequency, this syndrome is difficult to distinguish from other forms of degenerative dementia.</p><p>As noted above, the D178N mutation occurs in fCJD as well as other prion diseases. A substitution of isoleucine for valine in codon 210 has also been noted in fCJD and was the most common <em>PRNP</em> mutation type observed among 104 cases of fCJD in Italy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>]. Other missense mutations as well as insertion mutations have been described as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/98-103\" class=\"abstract_t\">98-103</a>].</p><p>Unlike fCJD, sporadic CJD (sCJD) and iatrogenic CJD (iCJD) are not associated with <em>PRNP</em> gene mutations. However, even in these forms of CJD and vCJD, phenotyping at codon 129 appears to affect susceptibility and perhaps expression of the clinical illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. While 51 percent of the general population is heterozygous at codon 129, all cases of vCJD and 85 to 95 percent of individuals with sCJD have been found to be homozygous at this codon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. In a separate report, five of seven patients who developed iCJD after receiving human cadaveric growth hormone were homozygous at codon 129 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p>One group has proposed a molecular classification scheme for sCJD based upon codon 129 polymorphism and characterization of the properties of PrPSc, which was used to evaluate 300 sCJD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. As examples, a pattern of type 1 PrPSc plus at least one methionine at codon 129 was demonstrated in 70 percent, while type 2 PrPSc plus codon 129 homozygous or heterozygous for valine was present in 25 percent and associated with ataxia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=creutzfeldt-jakob-disease#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;, section on 'Molecular subtypes of sCJD'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Gerstmann-Str&auml;ussler-Scheinker syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All GSS kindreds investigated to date have <em>PRNP</em> gene mutations. The P102L is the most common mutation and the one described in the descendants of the original family described by Gerstmann, Str&auml;ussler, and Scheinker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/107-109\" class=\"abstract_t\">107-109</a>]. Many other mutations have been identified as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/110-115\" class=\"abstract_t\">110-115</a>]. As noted above, patients with some of these mutations have been clinically classified as fCJD or FFI rather than GSS. </p><p>GSS exhibits a large degree of phenotypic heterogeneity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. This may be partially due to differences in the underlying <em>PRNP</em> mutation. GSS patients with the P102L mutation, for example, may have more prominent cerebellar features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>], while dementia may be a more prominent feature in patients with A117V, Y145STOP, and F198S mutations. Polymorphism at codon 129 may also play a modulating role in the manifestations of GSS in patients with the P102L mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/116-118\" class=\"abstract_t\">116-118</a>]. However, varied clinical expression of these diseases both between and within affected families with the same gene mutations suggests that other unidentified factors probably also are influential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/116,118,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">116,118,119</a>]. A study of GSS patients with the P102L mutation, employing monoclonal antibodies that recognize wild-type but not mutant PrP, demonstrated a spectrum of involvement of wild-type as well as mutant PrP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. This may also contribute to the phenotypic variability seen in this disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Fatal familial insomnia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the D178N mutation has been the predominant mutation found in nearly all families with FFI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. This mutation also occurs in fCJD. It appears that patients with this mutation who are homozygous for methionine at codon 129 develop an FFI-like clinical syndrome, whereas those homozygous for valine develop fCJD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>]. Heterozygosity at codon 129 may prolong the duration and slow the temporal progression of FFI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-genetics-of-prions/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7967336\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prion diseases are neurodegenerative diseases that have long incubation periods and progress inexorably once clinical symptoms appear.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prions are small infectious pathogens containing protein but apparently lacking nucleic acid. The prion protein (PrP) is the critical component of these agents and may, in fact, be its exclusive constituent. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Biology of prions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One characteristic feature of prions is their resistance to a number of normal decontaminating procedures. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Biology of prions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prion diseases appear to result from accumulation of abnormal isoforms of the PrP, a membrane-bound glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored protein found in the brains of normal animals on both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. These changes are due to variation in amino acid sequence as well as glycosylation of the PrP. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Prion protein'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transport of the abnormal PrP to the nervous system, once it appears in the host, occurs via axons and appears to be neurotoxic; accumulation of this protein or fragments of it in neurons leads to apoptosis and cell death. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Transport of PrPSc to the nervous system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The gene encoding the PrP in humans is located on the short arm of chromosome 20. A strong link was established between mutations in this gene and forms of prion disease with a familial predisposition (familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease [fCJD], Gerstmann-Str&auml;ussler-Scheinker syndrome [GSS], and fatal familial insomnia [FFI]). A single mutation can produce different clinical phenotypes in different individuals or families.
