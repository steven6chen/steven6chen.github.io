Neuropathic pain is usually burning, tingling, sharp, or stabbing. People can have the pain all the time, or the pain can come and go. Neuropathic pain is usually worse at rest and at night. Sometimes, people feel a lot of pain when they are touched gently.</p><p>Neuropathic pain can be severe and affect daily life. For instance, neuropathic pain can keep people from sleeping or eating well. This can lead to depression and anxiety.</p><p>In some cases, neuropathic pain goes away on its own. But in other cases, it can last months or years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18836200\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes neuropathic pain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different conditions can cause neuropathic pain, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetic neuropathy &ndash; This is a form of nerve damage that can happen in people with diabetes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postherpetic neuralgia &ndash; This is a condition that can happen after people have a painful rash called &quot;shingles.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stroke &ndash; A stroke is when a part of the brain is damaged because of a problem with blood flow. People can have neuropathic pain after a stroke.</p><p/><p>But sometimes, doctors can't figure out what's causing a person's neuropathic pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18836215\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. He or she might do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve tests to check whether your nerves are working normally</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18836230\"><span class=\"h1\">How is neuropathic pain treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments for neuropathic pain include both medicines and activities. No single treatment works for everyone. Your doctor or nurse will help you find the right mix of treatments for you.</p><p>Several different types of medicines can be used to treat neuropathic pain. The medicines used most often are ones that are also used to treat other conditions. Doctors treat neuropathic pain with medicines for depression, because they work on areas of the brain that process pain. Doctors also treat neuropathic pain with medicines that prevent seizures, because they help with overactive nerves.</p><p>Other medicines doctors sometimes use to treat neuropathic pain include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain-relieving or numbing medicines that go on the skin as a cream, patch, or spray</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injections (shots) of numbing or pain-relieving medicines that go into the spine or the area with pain</p><p/><p>Prescription pain medicines called opioids are sometimes used for neuropathic pain. However, these medications can lead to problems with abuse or addiction in some people. Opioids are also sometimes called &quot;narcotics.&quot;</p><p>Other kinds of treatments can also help with neuropathic pain. Some of these include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Working with a counselor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relaxation therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massage therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acupuncture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Devices that affect nerve signals</p><p/><p>To find the best treatment for you, you should be open to trying new treatments or combinations of treatments. Sometimes people have to try a few different things before they find the one that works best.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18836245\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a heating pad or cold pack on the painful area. Check with your doctor before trying this to make sure it is OK for your individual condition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Learn ways to relax your mind and body, such as doing deep breathing exercises. Relaxing your mind can help with how the body feels pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stay as active as possible. If you haven't been active for a while, start slowly and increase your activity slowly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tell your doctor or nurse if you feel depressed. Neuropathic pain and depression often go together, and each can make the other worse. Getting treatment for your depression can help you cope more easily with your pain.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18836260\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-damage-caused-by-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nerve damage caused by diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shingles-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Shingles (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alternative-medicine-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Alternative medicine (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Depression (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-neuropathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetic neuropathy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shingles-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Shingles (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Depression in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
