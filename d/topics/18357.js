Upper UTIs (ie, acute pyelonephritis) may lead to renal scarring, hypertension, and end-stage renal dysfunction. Although children with pyelonephritis tend to present with fever, it is often difficult on clinical grounds to distinguish cystitis from pyelonephritis, particularly in young children (aged &lt;2 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-children-long-term-management-and-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, we have defined UTI broadly here without attempting to distinguish cystitis from pyelonephritis. Acute cystitis in older children is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cystitis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-older-than-two-years-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cystitis: Clinical features and diagnosis in children older than two years and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The long-term management and prevention of UTI in children will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, diagnosis, acute management, and prognosis of UTI in children and UTI in newborns are discussed separately.

In a multicenter cohort of children 2 to 71 months of age with a history of UTI who did not receive prophylactic antibiotics, BBD at baseline was associated with increased risk of two-year recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio 2.07, 95% CI 1.09-3.93) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-children-long-term-management-and-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In combined analysis of data from two studies of children at risk for recurrent UTI, toilet-trained children with BBD and VUR were at greater risk for recurrent UTI than children with either BBD or VUR alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-children-long-term-management-and-prevention/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Treatment of bladder and bowel dysfunction should be initiated by the primary care provider. The first steps in the treatment of bladder and bowel dysfunction include timed voiding (scheduled voids every two to three hours), &quot;double&quot; voiding (asking children to sit and urinate again right after they voided), avoidance of C's (carbonated drinks, caffeine, citrus, chocolate, and food colorants), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the use of laxatives for children with constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-children-long-term-management-and-prevention/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

The management of VUR and bladder and bowel dysfunction are discussed elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-vesicoureteral-reflux\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of vesicoureteral reflux&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several randomized trials have evaluated the benefit of prophylactic antibiotics in preventing recurrent UTI in children, but most studies included only children with VUR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-children-long-term-management-and-prevention/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Three trials included children with and without VUR, but none was powered to detect differences in efficacy in the subgroup of children without VUR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-children-long-term-management-and-prevention/abstract/26,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28,29</a>]. A meta-analysis of individual data restricted to young children 2 to 24 months of age without VUR did not detect a benefit for prophylaxis in preventing recurrence (17 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-children-long-term-management-and-prevention/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Importantly, very few children in the three trials had history of recurrent UTIs. Thus, there are few data to guide care of children with frequent recurrent UTIs. Another meta-analysis of seven randomized trials including 1427 children &le;18 years (with and without VUR) found that antibiotic prophylaxis did not prevent renal scarring (5 versus 7 percent, risk ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.55-1.26) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-children-long-term-management-and-prevention/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The proportion of patients with recurrent UTI was not reported.</p><p>There is indirect evidence to suggest that prophylaxis may be effective in preventing recurrent UTIs. In two companion studies of children with and without VUR who were followed prospectively for two years, the rate of reinfection was lowest in children with VUR who were randomized to prophylaxis (12 percent), highest in children with VUR randomized to placebo (25 percent), and intermediate in children with no VUR who were followed without using prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-children-long-term-management-and-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Assuming that the antimicrobial prophylaxis treatment effect observed in the randomized intervention for VUR (RIVUR) study would apply to children with no VUR, the use of prophylaxis may reduce the risk of recurrent UTIs. As such, its use may be reasonable in subgroups of children with no VUR who have a very high likelihood of reinfection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3538909119\"><span class=\"h2\">Unproven interventions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2690407517\"><span class=\"h3\">Surveillance cultures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine surveillance cultures for asymptomatic children after their first UTI should not be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-children-long-term-management-and-prevention/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].
