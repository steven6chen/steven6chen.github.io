Although the term technically refers to nutrition given either by mouth or through a feeding tube, in common usage the term usually refers to tube feeding. In comparison to parenteral nutrition (the provision of nutrients via a venous catheter directly into the bloodstream), enteral nutrition offers several advantages, including lower costs, beneficial effects from utilization of the gastrointestinal tract, and avoidance of the many potential complications of parenteral nutrition. &#160;</p><p>For many pediatric patients with suboptimal nutrition, intake by mouth can be improved by offering high-calorie foods, oral supplements, or boosting the nutrient density of foods by adding high-energy supplements such as fats (oils, cream, or butter), carbohydrates (sugars and powdered supplements), and proteins (milk or other protein powders). Children who are still unable to take in sufficient energy through these approaches, or those who are unable to tolerate oral feedings because of the underlying disease, are candidates for enteral nutrition.</p><p>Related content can be found in the following UpToDate topic reviews:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-growth-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of growth in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parenteral nutrition in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parenteral nutrition in premature infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to enteral nutrition in the premature infant&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of short bowel syndrome in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4320422\"><span class=\"h1\">NUTRITIONAL ASSESSMENT IN CHILDREN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision about whether to initiate enteral nutrition in children should begin with a thorough, reliable, and valid evaluation of nutritional status. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3381963668\"><span class=\"h2\">General evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general assessment of nutritional status begins by obtaining, plotting and interpreting weight, length, and head circumference data on sex- and age-specific growth curves. For full-term infants and children up to 24 months of age, the growth charts developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) should be used; these standards were derived from healthy infants who were exclusively breastfed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For children 2 to 20 years old in the United States, the growth charts developed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) should be used. These growth charts include curves for weight for age, length (height) for age, as well as body mass index (BMI) on which an individual patients values can be plotted and tracked over time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-growth-in-children#H31542395\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of growth in children&quot;, section on 'Recommended growth charts'</a>.) </p><p>For premature infants, evaluation of the degree of prematurity is critical and often leads to a decision to initiate tube feedings until oral feeds are possible. Enteral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parenteral nutrition usually is required until a premature infant reaches approximately 34 weeks gestational age. Appropriate growth curves or correction for gestational age should be employed when judging the nutritional status of premature infants. The evaluation for and management of enteral feeds in premature infants are discussed in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to enteral nutrition in the premature infant&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-management-in-preterm-infants#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth management in preterm infants&quot;, section on 'Normative growth data'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2631728957\"><span class=\"h2\">Determination of malnutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several different schemes have been proposed for interpretation of anthropometric data to classify degrees of malnutrition, including the methods of Gomez, Waterlow, and others. In general, deficits in weight for age are classified as &quot;underweight&quot;, deficits in length for age are classified as &quot;stunting&quot;, and deficits of weight for length are classified as &quot;wasting&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83941\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83941 \">figure 1</a>). The severity of the deficits are categorized using Z-scores, which can be obtained from these calculators:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants zero to two years</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Girls (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-who-assessment-of-malnutrition-in-girls-0-to-2-years-old\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Boys (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-who-assessment-of-malnutrition-in-boys-0-to-2-years-old\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children two to five years </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Girls (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-who-assessment-of-malnutrition-in-girls-2-to-5-years-old\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 3</a>) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Boys (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-who-assessment-of-malnutrition-in-boys-2-to-5-years-old\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 4</a>) </p><p/><p>Details and comparison of techniques for assessing malnutrition in children are discussed in a separate topic review. It should be noted that nutritional assessment with standard anthropometric criteria are just as valid in children from resource-poor as well as resource-rich countries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malnutrition in children in resource-limited countries: Clinical assessment&quot;, section on 'Clinical assessment'</a>.) </p><p>Anthropometric measures of the arm provide helpful and supplementary data, especially in clinical scenarios when measurement of body weight is not possible or is altered by severe edema, or when height cannot be accurately measured (eg, cerebral palsy, critical illness). These include measures of triceps <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biceps skin fold thickness (TSF and BSF, respectively), and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC). TSF and BSF are measured with a skin fold caliper, and MUAC with a non-stretchable tape measure, both measured by trained personnel. Standard equations can calculate mid-arm muscle area (MAMA) from TSF and MUAC. MAMA is an estimate of peripheral lean body mass, and TSF and BSF are reasonable estimates of peripheral body fat composition (though not central adiposity).

It is relatively simple and practical to use. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other tools are the Nutrition Risk Score (NRS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], the Pediatric Nutritional Risk Score (PNRS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], the Screening Tool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Paediatrics (STAMP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and the Paediatric Yorkhill Malnutrition Score (PYMS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p/><p>The aim of all of these screening tools is to identify children at risk of malnutrition on hospital admission and determine the need for nutritional intervention during hospitalization. However, there are differences in the use of these tools. For example, SGNA is designed to evaluate the <strong>actual</strong> nutritional status of a child on admission, whereas STRONGkids is designed to predict the <strong>risk</strong> of children becoming malnourished during the hospital stay. A tool that predicts nutritional risk during the hospital admission may be more valuable because it is tied to clinical decision-making about nutritional interventions. However, a systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence to select one of these tools over the others, based on predictive accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4320429\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR ENTERAL NUTRITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any child who is unable to meet nutritional requirements by mouth is a candidate for enteral nutrition. The decision to treat and the route of supplementation depends on the underlying disease, its severity and anticipated course, and several other patient-specific considerations. &#160;</p><p>Regardless of the technique used for nutritional assessment, pre-existing undernutrition (as defined by low birthweight, underweight, or wasting) is an indication to begin enteral nutrition sooner than among well-nourished subjects. In under-nourished infants and children, repletion of body weight is a primary goal for enteral nutrition and measure of its efficacy. </p><p>Indications for enteral nutrition fall into one of the following general categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Impaired swallowing or oral motor development, or oral aversion </strong>&ndash; Underlying conditions include cerebral palsy or other neurologic problems (resulting in spasticity or poor coordination of skeletal muscles involved in eating), congenital anomalies of the gastrointestinal tract, and prematurity (in which developmental skills in oral intake are incomplete).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Excessive metabolic demands </strong>&ndash; Infants with sepsis, congenital heart disease, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia or children with critical illness commonly require enteral feeding to meet their nutrient needs, which are increased by the illness. As compared with adults, infants and children have proportionately lower reserves of body protein, carbohydrate, and fat, and also have increased metabolic needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. As a result, the threshold for beginning supplemental enteral nutrition is also lower than in adults: In infants and children with these diseases, insufficient oral intake for three to five days is a suitable threshold for intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Impaired absorption or digestion </strong>&ndash; This broad category includes children with short bowel syndrome, cystic fibrosis, Crohn's disease, some inborn errors of metabolism, chronic renal insufficiency, and others. The indications and type of enteral nutrition varies depending on the underlying condition, as discussed in the following section. </p><p/><p>The following sections present an overview of the indications for enteral nutrition for each of several disorders or categories. More detail is available in the linked topic reviews. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1171061692\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital heart disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Growth failure is a common complication of congenital heart disease. Malnutrition is probably caused by several mechanisms: These patients often have increased energy requirements due to increased work of breathing and cardiac effort, and may have malabsorption from poor oxygen delivery to the intestine. In addition, they often have inadequate energy intake because of anorexia, early satiety, and general feeding intolerance, caused by congestive heart failure that leads to dyspnea, tachycardia, and fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The severity and type of growth failure depends in part on the type of cardiac defect: cyanotic defects are typically associated with poor gains in both weight and length, while infants with acyanotic defects have poor weight gain but relatively preserved linear growth. Chronic hypoxia can be another factor resulting in poor growth. </p><p>Children with growth failure due to congenital heart disease usually are not able to meet their energy needs with oral feeds alone, and often require enteral feeding support. In some cases, infants and young children with congenital heart disease also have ischemic bowel disease, with mucosal damage and sometimes requiring surgical resection, so specialized formulas may be indicated. However, the majority of children with CHD can tolerate enteral feeding with intact protein formulas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-cyanotic-heart-disease-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and initial management of cyanotic heart disease in the newborn&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children#H476105926\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of isolated ventricular septal defects in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Nutritional support'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3862217793\"><span class=\"h2\">Cystic fibrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with cystic fibrosis frequently have growth failure, caused by the combination of malabsorption, increased energy needs, and reduced appetite. Initiation of enteral feedings is appropriate if the child's body mass index cannot be kept in the target range (body mass index [BMI] at or above the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile for age) despite optimization of pancreatic enzyme therapy and oral nutrition support. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Nutritional issues&quot;, section on 'Nutrition support'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4320450\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal disease and dysfunction</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14438566\"><span class=\"h3\">Short bowel syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both enteral and parenteral feeding are required for many infants and children with short bowel syndrome. Even small quantities of enteral feeding promote intestinal adaptation and enhance feeding tolerance; continuous feeding is usually better tolerated than bolus feeding. Over time, enteral feeds can and should be gradually increased to supply an increasing proportion of the patient's nutritional needs. Reducing dependence of parenteral nutrition is particularly important in infants with short bowel syndrome, who are at high risk for developing intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD) and recurrent central venous line infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of short bowel syndrome in children&quot;, section on 'Enteral feeding'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal failure-associated liver disease in infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2539927881\"><span class=\"h3\">Crohn disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and particularly those with Crohn disease, frequently have nutritionally- and inflammatory-mediated deficits in growth that often precede the diagnosis of the IBD. At the time of diagnosis of Crohn disease, approximately 25 percent of children have low body weight, 80 percent have reduced height velocity, and most have delayed pubertal development. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth failure and poor weight gain in children with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Clinical consequences'</a>.)</p><p>Nutritional support for children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease depends on the degree of nutritional deficits and response to medical treatment of the IBD, ranging from dietary counseling, to liquid supplements taken by mouth, to supplemental enteral nutrition. Close monitoring of nutritional status and growth and a proactive approach to supplemental nutrition is important to optimize growth and minimize consequences of malnutrition, including bone disease. In some cases, exclusive enteral nutrition (in which all nutritional needs are supplied as a liquid formula, taken by mouth or through enteral feeds), is used as primary therapy for the IBD itself. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth failure and poor weight gain in children with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Intervention'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents#H1252944020\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of Crohn disease in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Exclusive enteral nutrition'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3925897500\"><span class=\"h3\">Biliary atresia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nutritional problems in infants and children with biliary atresia and other cases of chronic cholestatic liver disease are common and difficult to overcome. They are caused by a combination of malabsorption due to cholestasis and chronic liver inflammation. Depending on the severity of the nutritional deficit, this is managed by increasing the energy content of oral feeds or by enteral nutrition, given by nasogastric tube <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> changing to a formula with higher MCT oil content. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biliary-atresia#H19844523\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biliary atresia&quot;, section on 'Nutrition'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4422335\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) frequently have nutritional problems due to poor appetite, decreased intestinal absorption of nutrients, and metabolic acidosis, which can impair growth and cognitive development. Nutritional management of children with CKD focuses on their unique energy, protein, vitamin, mineral, and electrolyte needs, and is discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-children#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic kidney disease in children&quot;, section on 'Nutrition'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease#H6760122\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodialysis for children with chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Inadequate nutrition'</a>.) </p><p>Growth may be further impaired by altered growth hormone production and metabolism, and this component responds to treatment with recombinant growth hormone.

The extent of hypermetabolism varies substantially and is difficult to predict with certainty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]; it may be less common with modern techniques for anesthesia and pain control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Overfeeding should be avoided because it increases the ventilatory work by increasing carbon dioxide production, and can induce hepatic steatosis and cholestasis, and hyperglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Children with critical illness should undergo nutritional assessment upon entry into the intensive care unit (ICU) to identify preexisting nutritional problems (either underweight or overweight) as well as risk factors for the development of nutritional complications (including expectations for when the patient will be able to eat, and predicted metabolic needs) due to critical illness or its therapy. A measured weight should be obtained if at all possible on admission, and periodically remeasured during the hospital stay. Serial measurements of weight are often overlooked in the ICU, but provide critical information about changes in the patient's nutritional and fluid status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Standard equations can be used to estimate energy needs, but are often unreliable, and can either underestimate or overestimate needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Therefore, the use of indirect calorimetry to measure energy needs has been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Periodic reassessment of nutrition needs and monitoring of actual input is important, because energy requirements change during the course of an illness, and because the quantity of enteral feeds actually administered is often well below the intended target, due to interruptions in the feeding schedule due to intolerance or competing medical procedures, such as fasting prior to medical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/15,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,24,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4320479\"><span class=\"h3\">Burns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with thermal injury have increased requirements for energy and protein, which must be met to achieve optimal outcomes. Their micronutrient status is probably altered as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/15,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,26</a>]. This is due in part to a hypermetabolic response to the burn injury, which markedly increases energy needs. As an example, the metabolic rate in children with burn injuries of more than 40 percent of their body surface area increases by about 180 percent, and remained elevated at 150 percent even after full healing of the wound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. As a result of these increased needs, nutritional support should be given to patients with moderate or severe burns (based on burn depth and surface area) within 24 to 48 hours of the injury, if the patient is stable but unable to consume sufficient calories by mouth. Nutritional management of patients with severe burns, including formula selection and equations for estimating energy needs in children, are discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional demands and enteral formulas for moderate-to-severe burn patients&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The hypermetabolic response to the injury also causes increased protein catabolism with muscle wasting, and peripheral insulin resistance, which leads to hyperglycemia. The prevention of hyperglycemia with intensive regimens including exogenous insulin has also been shown to improve outcomes in children with burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. However, maintaining a continuous insulin infusion in burn patients is difficult because of the need for frequent interruptions in their enteral feedings, with associated risks for hypoglycemia. These and other issues related to the hypermetabolic response in adults and children with burn injuries are discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypermetabolic response to severe burn injury&quot;, section on 'Glycemic control'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4320486\"><span class=\"h3\">Cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nutritional management of patients with cancer is critical during active disease and during the treatment regimens. Treatment such as chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery may cause anorexia, poor oral tolerance, and inadequate intake. Energy requirements are variable depending on stress and state of catabolism, and may be impacted by tumor burden. Tube feedings for total intake or as a supplement to oral intake can be considered to support a patient during treatment and when anorexia occurs. Standard feedings can be used unless there are issues with malabsorption, in which case a semi-elemental feeding may be advantageous.</p><p>Patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are particularly likely to require nutritional support. In many cases they require parenteral, rather than enteral nutrition, due to gastrointestinal dysfunction from preparative chemotherapy and radiation. These children may have lower energy needs than predicted by standard equations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], so direct measurement of nutritional needs by indirect calorimetry can help target energy intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4320493\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuromuscular impairment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuromuscular disease may either decrease or increase energy requirements. As examples, children with choreoathetoid cerebral palsy (but not spastic cerebral palsy) tend to have increased energy expenditure, whereas those with Down syndrome or myelomeningocele generally have lower energy requirements than expected for their age and size. The energy requirement also may depend on the child's nutritional status: the resting energy expenditure (REE) of malnourished children with severe cerebral palsy tends to be lower than expected prior to a nutritional intervention, but rises to normal after supplemental feeds are begun [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This pattern is similar to that seen in other children with malnutrition. Because of the variable energy needs of neurologically impaired children, it is important to monitor a child's nutritional status after beginning a nutrition intervention, and readjust energy intake as needed.</p><p>Some children with neuromuscular impairment are also at risk for aspiration due to swallowing dysfunction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gastroesophageal reflux; these are important considerations when selecting the route and regimen for enteral nutrition.

They are not recommended for the prevention of food allergies, or for feeding infants at risk for allergic disease (eg, siblings or children of an individual with allergic disease). Soy formulas are generally not recommended for infants with food protein-induced proctocolitis, because many of these infants are sensitive to both cow's milk and soy protein. Extensively hydrolyzed formulas are generally preferred for such infants.

Use of blenderized formulas require larger bore gastrostomy tubes to prevent clogging, and families need to be willing to invest time to prepare the blenderized formula, and to follow proper food safety measures. This approach is most practical for use if the patient can tolerate bolus feedings via syringe; this avoids use of a pump, which tends to cause more problems with occlusion. In addition, hang times for blenderized feedings are recommended to be two hours or less for food safety reasons. As with all enteral formulas, ongoing monitoring for tolerance, adequacy, and growth is essential. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Commercial blenderized formulas are also available and some are nutritionally complete. Since these commercial formulas are sterile, their hang time is not limited to two hours. Some of the newer commercial blenderized products may not be covered by insurance, and may or may not be nutritionally complete, so these require careful planning to ensure that micronutrient and fluid needs are met.

They are appropriate for most infants with food protein-induced proctocolitis or IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy. These formulas are lactose-free and most have some percentage of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medium-chain-triglycerides-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">medium chain triglycerides</a>, which can be useful in cases of fat malabsorption.

Infant formulas need to be provided in volumes of 150 to 175 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/day</span> to provide recommended requirements of energy, vitamins, and minerals (if given at standard concentrations). Younger infants or those needing catch-up growth will be on the higher end of this range.

On the other hand, older infants and children who are receiving the bulk of their nutrition via enteral nutrition due to medical or gastrointestinal diseases often rely on formula for all of their nutritional needs. The total fluid, energy, and macro- and micronutrient needs of these patients therefore should be reviewed serially.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3900072499\"><span class=\"h3\">Toddlers and older children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After one year of age, a variety of formulas are available, depending on the child's needs and some disease-specific considerations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53184%7EGAST%2F65947\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53184 graphicRef65947 \">table 4A-B</a>).

One approach is to target an energy intake about 200 kcals below the usual range for the child's age group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78274\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78274 \">table 6</a>). The intake can then be adjusted up or down to achieve gradual weight loss. When energy needs are restricted, it is imperative to evaluate the adequacy of other macronutrients and micronutrients provided in the volume of formula administered. Additional protein, calcium, sodium, potassium, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vitamin D may be required. In young children with obesity admitted for intercurrent illnesses, energy restriction to promote weight loss is probably not useful and may impede recovery from the illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23168346\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients on long-term enteral feeds, the adequacy of energy intake is monitored by serially measuring height and weight and plotting the results on a growth curve. For those with suboptimal growth, the caloric intake can be increased by increasing feeding volume <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> concentration.</p><p>For these patients, we also suggest periodic assessment of routine blood chemistries (eg, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, iron, and fat soluble vitamins) to ensure optimal nutrition.

Access can be intragastric (eg, orogastric, nasogastric, or gastrostomy tubes), or transpyloric (eg, nasoduodenal, nasojejunal). The choice depends on whether the anticipated need for enteral feeds is short- or long-term, and whether there is an aspiration risk: &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H917984853\"><span class=\"h2\">Short-term needs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Naso- or orogastric access can be used for infants and children who are predicted to have only short-term need for enteral feeds (eg, less than three months). In addition, they are often used as an interim measure to feed and assess tolerance of enteral feedings before placement of an ostomy for long-term enteral feeding. Placement of a nasogastric or orogastric tube does not require surgery or endoscopy, and parents can be taught how to replace the tube at home. Potential disadvantages with this route are interference with oral intake, easy dislodgement, irritation to the <span class=\"nowrap\">nasal/oral</span> area, infection, and, for older children, stigmatization with visible tube in place. The nasogastric route usually is preferred over gastrostomy for patients with biliary atresia or other causes of portal hypertension, because of the propensity to develop varices around the site of a gastrostomy. (See <a href=\"#H4320450\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal disease and dysfunction'</a> above.) </p><p>A soft, flexible feeding tube (eg, made from polyurethane or silicone) should be used if possible. Tube sizes of 4 French should be used for neonates and infants, and 8 French for children and adolescents. Smaller tubes are more comfortable for the patient, but may become clogged more quickly with formula and medication administration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1376427074\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term needs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrostomy tube (GT) feeding usually is appropriate if long-term enteral feeding is required, and they are usually easily placed laparoscopically or endoscopically. The gastrostomy can be fitted with a device that is easy to cover with clothes. Disadvantages of gastrostomy placement include local irritation, infection or granulation tissue, leaking, allergic reaction, and possible dislodgement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>Bolus intragastric feedings are generally preferred over continuous feeds if they can be tolerated, since they provide a more normal pattern of eating and can deliver larger volumes over a shorter period of time (generally 10 to 20 minutes per bolus). If the patient can tolerate a bolus by gravity infusion, a pump is not necessary. Bolus feeds may also reduce the risk of aspiration because they are typically administered while the infant or child is awake and upright. On the other hand, the bolus method feeding might also increase the risk of pulmonary aspiration if large volumes are given. If a bolus feed is given while the child is asleep, the head of the bed should be elevated to least at a 45 degree angle to help reduce aspiration risk.</p><p>Continuous feeding regimens are useful for infants and children who do not tolerate bolus feeds, either because of malabsorptive disease (eg, short bowel syndrome), feeding intolerance (eg, many infants with congenital heart disease), or gastroesophageal reflux with aspiration risk (eg, some children neurologic impairment). This method requires a pump, and appropriate measures to ensure freshness of the formula or breast milk in the reservoir. In addition, continuous nocturnal feeding is used for some children with a chronic illness to supplement to their daytime oral intake (eg, children with cystic fibrosis and growth failure). When feeds are given while the child is asleep, the head of the bed should be elevated, as described above for bolus feeds. Some children may have an additional surgical procedure (eg, a fundoplication) to provide additional protection against gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration.</p><p>Unless contraindicated by the patient's condition (eg, aspiration risk), some feeds should be provided by mouth even if this provides minimal caloric content. This is because patients who are not fed by mouth often develop a feeding aversion that can interfere with the transition back to oral feeds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

Transpyloric feeding requires a pump and continuous infusion schedule of feedings because infusion of boluses directly into the small intestine results in dumping syndrome and is contraindicated. Small pumps are available and can be carried by the child in a backpack to allow mobility. </p><p>Short-term transpyloric feeding is given through a nasojejunal (NJ). NJ tubes are most commonly used in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, when feeding courses are short and patient motion is minimal. Outside of the ICU setting, NJ tubes have a number of drawbacks: they are difficult to place correctly, and often require fluoroscopy to guide the tube through the pylorus and ensure appropriate tip location, with the associated risk of radiation exposure. Therefore, for patients requiring long-term administration of transpyloric feeds, surgical placement of a GJT or JT is preferable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H686565055\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Enteral nutrition offers several advantages over parenteral nutrition including lower costs, beneficial effects from utilization of the gastrointestinal tract, and avoidance of the many potential complications of parenteral nutrition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common indications for enteral nutrition in children fall into the following categories (which are not mutually exclusive) (see <a href=\"#H4320429\" class=\"local\">'Indications for enteral nutrition'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Impaired <span class=\"nowrap\">swallowing/oral</span> aversion or intestinal dysfunction (eg, prematurity, cerebral palsy or other neurologic problems or congenital anomalies of the gastrointestinal tract)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Excessive metabolic demands (sepsis, burns or other type of critical illness; congenital heart disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Impaired absorption or digestion (short bowel syndrome, cystic fibrosis, Crohn disease, some inborn errors of metabolism, chronic renal insufficiency) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selection of a formula for enteral feeding depends on the patient's age, ability to tolerate intact protein, and sometimes on disease-specific considerations. Separate formulas are used for infants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75231\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75231 \">table 3</a>) as compared with children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53184%7EGAST%2F65947\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53184 graphicRef65947 \">table 4A-B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4320500\" class=\"local\">'Formula selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When initiating enteral feeds, the target volume is calculated based on estimated needs for fluids and energy. For children whose growth is within a healthy range, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) provides an appropriate estimate of these needs, as shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78274\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78274 \">table 6</a>). These estimates are then adjusted up for children needing catch-up growth or those with a hypermetabolic disease state or adjusted down for those who are overweight. (See <a href=\"#H4320507\" class=\"local\">'Nutritional requirements'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients undergoing long-term enteral feeding should be periodically reassessed by plotting serial heights and weights, and the volume of feeds should be adjusted up or down to achieve optimal growth. Serial measurements of body weight are often overlooked in critically ill patients, but are important to ensure adequate nutrition for recovery and growth. (See <a href=\"#H4320507\" class=\"local\">'Nutritional requirements'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutritional requirements are particularly difficult to predict in patients with certain critical illnesses, including severe burn injuries or those undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In such cases, measurement of the resting metabolic rate by indirect calorimetry provides an estimate of the patient's nutritional needs, and can help to avoid under- and over-feeding. (See <a href=\"#H4320479\" class=\"local\">'Burns'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4320486\" class=\"local\">'Cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enteral feedings can be administered via intragastric (eg, orogastric, nasogastric, or gastrostomy tubes), or transpyloric (eg, nasoduodenal, nasojejunal, or gastrojejunal) tubes. The choice depends on whether the anticipated need for enteral feeds is short- or long-term, and whether there is an aspiration risk. Unless contraindicated by the patient's condition (eg, aspiration risk), patients requiring long-term enteral feeds should also be given some feeds by mouth, to avoid development of a feeding aversion. (See <a href=\"#H4320529\" class=\"local\">'Administration'</a> above.) </p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Grummer-Strawn LM, Reinold C, Krebs NF, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
