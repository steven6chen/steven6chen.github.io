Ovarian carcinoma is traditionally referred to as a single entity, but it consists of a heterogeneous group of neoplasms with multiple histologic subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Current management of these neoplasms is largely dependent upon factors such as tumor grade and stage. It is important, however, to accurately subclassify these neoplasms, since each is a biologically different disease with different epidemiologic and genetic risk factors, precursor lesions, patterns of spread, molecular biology, response to therapy, and prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Moreover, as new therapies are developed, it will be essential to determine which subtypes of ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal carcinomas respond to which treatment modalities.</p><p>The incidence, histopathology, and molecular biology of histologic subtypes of epithelial ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal carcinomas and borderline neoplasms will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of these neoplasms are discussed in detail separately.

The peak age range is 45 to 65 years with a mean of 57 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Most HGSC is diagnosed at an advanced stage (stage III or IV) and has a poor overall prognosis. HGSC that is confined to the ovary at diagnosis is rare (&lt;10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1295683471\"><span class=\"h2\">Gross pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HGSC can range in size from microscopic to greater than 20 cm in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The external surfaces of the neoplasm may be smooth or have friable surface papillae. The mass is typically cystic and multilocular with serous or bloody fluid and soft friable papillary excrescences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F91222\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91222 \">picture 1</a>). Other areas may be solid and range from soft to firm, depending on the tumor stroma. Hemorrhage and necrosis are frequently present.</p><p>Gross metastases are often found throughout the peritoneum and the omentum. These are typically firm nodules of various sizes that may coalesce into larger masses, often an omental cake. In up to 25 percent of cases, however, the omentum may appear grossly normal, but microscopic neoplasm is identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1295683478\"><span class=\"h2\">Microscopic pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microscopically, HGSC may have a variety of architectural patterns. These include: complex papillary, glandular, microcystic, and solid patterns. HGSC infiltrates, destroys, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> replaces the normal stroma. Psammoma bodies may be present, but are rarely as numerous as in low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC). (See <a href=\"#H1295683499\" class=\"local\">'Low-grade serous carcinoma'</a> below.)</p><p>The key feature of HGSC, regardless of the overall architectural pattern, is the marked cytologic atypia with prominent mitotic activity. The atypical nuclei are hyperchromatic with a threefold or greater variation in nuclear size, and tumor giant cells are common. The mitotic rate is often very high, with the threshold for HGSC defined as &ge;12 mitotic figures per 10 high-powered fields (HPF); if mitotic rate is low, LGSC or other diagnosis must be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

HGSC also expresses WT-1, estrogen receptor, and PAX-8 in most cases.

Conversely, women with these germline mutations have a 30 to 50 percent risk of developing ovarian carcinoma, mainly HGSC, by age 70. The possible role of fallopian tubal neoplasia in the development of apparent ovarian carcinoma is an area of active investigation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal serous carcinomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Approximately 50 to 80 percent of HGSCs, regardless of <em>BRCA </em>germline status, also have mutations in tumor protein p53 gene (<em>TP53</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. Loss of function <em>TP53</em> mutations have been identified in up to 80 percent of HGSC and have also been identified in the putative precursor lesion of many HGSCs, serous intraepithelial <span class=\"nowrap\">neoplasia/carcinoma</span>. Relatively few other specific genetic mutations have been identified in HGSC, although widespread chromosomal instability and DNA copy number changes are consistently found in HGSC. Mutations in <em>PTEN </em>and <em>PI3CA </em>have also been reported, but their mutation frequency is generally low (&lt;10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1295683499\"><span class=\"h1\">LOW-GRADE SEROUS CARCINOMA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1295683507\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence and disease characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSC) is uncommon and accounts for fewer than 5 percent of all cases of ovarian carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Like HGSC, LGSC is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage, and consequently the long-term prognosis is poor. However, these neoplasms are biologically distinct from HGSC and are slow-growing, indolent neoplasms with relative insensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>LGSC is often found along with a noninvasive serous borderline component. Borderline serous neoplasms are more common than LGSC, and LGSC most likely represents progression of a serous borderline neoplasm. (See <a href=\"#H1295683728\" class=\"local\">'Serous borderline neoplasm'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1295683514\"><span class=\"h2\">Gross pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LGSC is often grossly indistinguishable from HGSC or serous borderline neoplasms. LGSC can be solid and cystic and may have numerous friable papillary excrescences either within the cysts or on the surface. Compared with HGSC, there is often less prominent hemorrhage and necrosis, although this is not a reliable gross feature. Extra-ovarian implants are typically firm and gritty due to stromal reaction and abundant psammoma body formation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1295683521\"><span class=\"h2\">Microscopic pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histologically, LGSC is an invasive carcinoma that is distinguished from serous borderline neoplasms by the presence of destructive stromal invasion. The three main patterns of invasion include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infiltration of the stroma by single cells and small clusters of cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infiltration of the stromal by small nests of epithelial cells (micropapillary pattern)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infiltration of the stroma by large papillae with a broad central fibrovascular core lined by neoplastic cells (macropapillary pattern)</p><p/><p>LGSC is differentiated from HGSC by cytologic features. LGSC is composed of small papillae lined by neoplastic cells that exhibit uniform nuclei with less than threefold variability in size. This uniformity of nuclear size is one of the features that distinguishes LGSC from HGSC; this has been shown to be highly reproducible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. The other distinguishing feature of LGSC is that it has a much lower mitotic activity than that observed in HGSC, with &lt;12 mitoses present per 10 high-powered fields (HPF) as the defined threshold. However, LGSC may demonstrate an even lower mitotic rate than the 11 per 10 HPF and this feature is very helpful in differentiating it from HGSC.</p><p>Another distinct feature that may be found in LGSC is a hyalinized stroma with numerous psammoma bodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F91224\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91224 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1295683528\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunophenotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LGSC has an immunophenotype similar to both serous borderline neoplasms and HGSC, but with two important differences. LGSC typically have low Ki67 proliferative rates (corresponding to the lower mitotic rate) and weak or wild-type p53 expression. However, p53 expression by immunohistochemistry has been shown to not be statistically significant in predicting p53 mutational analysis, so aberrant p53 staining in either LGSC or HGSC should not override the histologic impression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. LGSC express WT-1, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and are negative for HNF-1 beta and calretinin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1295683535\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular biology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Molecular studies have demonstrated that both LGSC and serous borderline neoplasms frequently have mutations in <em>BRAF</em> and <em>KRAS</em>, rather than in p53 or <em><span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/2,</em></span> as in HGSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, LGSC and serous borderline neoplasms do not demonstrate the prominent chromosomal instability or widespread DNA copy alterations seen in HGSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p>These findings have led to the proposal of two pathways of serous carcinogenesis. One pathway is typical for HGSC, in which mutations in <em>p53</em> play an important role, and the second pathway is typical of low-grade serous neoplasms, in which <em>KRAS</em> and <em>BRAF</em> play a prominent role. These studies have further implicated serous borderline neoplasms as the precursor lesion to LGSC and support the hypothesis that LGSCs do not progress into HGSCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. These molecular differences may lead to important treatment decisions in the future as new agents are utilized to target the <em>KRAS</em> and <em>BRAF</em> pathways in low-grade serous neoplasms, which are otherwise relatively resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy.

Endometrioid carcinoma presents most frequently in women in their 40s and 50s, with a mean patient age of 56 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p>Endometrioid carcinomas are most often identified at an early stage (unlike serous carcinomas), consequently these patients have a much better prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Endometrioid carcinomas tend to be relatively chemosensitive (unlike low-grade serous or clear cell carcinoma), which also contributes to the better prognosis relative to other subtypes of ovarian carcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H1295683592\" class=\"local\">'Clear cell carcinoma'</a> below.)</p><p>Primary ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma is typically low-grade. However, high-grade endometrioid carcinomas are morphologically and molecularly indistinguishable from high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), with immunophenotypic and gene profiling studies suggesting that high-grade endometrioid carcinoma is not a distinct tumor type, but rather a subtype of HGSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Ovarian endometrioid carcinoma is often associated with and believed to arise from endometriosis (up to 42 percent of patients have evidence of ovarian or pelvic endometriosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/3,45,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,45,47,48</a>].

Endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary also closely resembles the uterine counterparts histologically. In the setting of a concurrent endometrial carcinoma, the likelihood that the ovarian neoplasm is a metastasis is quite high, although other possibilities are metastasis from the ovary to the endometrium and concurrent ovarian and endometrial primaries. Characteristics that help to determine the primary site of the neoplasm are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F91232\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91232 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1295683564\"><span class=\"h2\">Gross pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Grossly, endometrioid carcinoma can have a variable appearance.

It is usually confined to one ovary (bilaterality favors metastasis from endometrium).</p><p>The papillary excrescences seen in serous carcinomas are not present, although the neoplasm can be quite friable and areas of hemorrhage and necrosis can be present. Grossly identifiable areas of endometrioid adenofibroma with cysts separated by prominent firm fibromatous stroma are often seen in association with both endometrioid carcinoma and endometrioid borderline neoplasm.

Clear cell carcinoma constitutes a larger percentage of ovarian cancers in East Asia, although it is unclear whether this is due to genetic or environmental factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Like endometrioid carcinoma, ovarian clear cell carcinoma often presents at an early stage (stage I or II) and has a relatively good prognosis due to the absence of distant metastases. However, when clear cell carcinoma presents at an advanced stage, it has a worse prognosis than serous or endometrioid carcinoma. This is because clear cell carcinoma is not as sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy as the other histologic subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. Clear cell carcinoma is also associated with an increased risk of vascular thrombotic events and paraneoplastic hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>].</p><p>Similar to endometrioid carcinoma, clear cell ovarian carcinoma is often associated with, and likely arises from, endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/60,62,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,62,64</a>]. In fact, tubal ligation has been shown to be protective against the development of ovarian clear cell carcinoma. The mechanism of this may be that occlusion of the tubes prevents retrograde menstruation and the subsequent development of endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

The tumor usually consists of a thick-walled uni- or multilocular cyst with yellowish, fleshy nodules protruding into the lumen of the cyst(s), and watery or mucinous fluid within the cyst(s). However, the neoplasm may also be solid or have a honeycomb-cut surface, especially those arising in conjunction with a clear cell adenofibroma or clear cell borderline neoplasm.

The most common patterns are solid, tubulocystic, and papillary. Sheets of polyhedral cells with clear cytoplasm separated by fibrous stroma characterize the solid pattern. The tubulocystic pattern contains multiple complex tubules and cysts that may be intermixed with the other patterns. The papillary pattern is formed by fibrous papillae of varying complexity lined by the neoplastic cells. In both the tubulocystic and papillary patterns, the neoplastic cells often assume a hobnail appearance with the nucleus protruding into the cyst or lumen and from the papillae.</p><p>Regardless of the overall architectural pattern, clear cell carcinomas often contain a prominent hyalinized stroma. The neoplastic cells often have distinct cell borders with nuclei of varying sizes and shapes. There may be a wide range of nuclear atypia, although there are almost always areas with marked cytologic atypia. However, the epithelium lining the glands and cyst can be flattened, creating a deceptively bland appearance. Mitotic activity can be prominent, but is often variable and lower than that seen in other epithelial ovarian carcinomas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1295683628\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunophenotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clear cell carcinomas have a unique immunophenotype among the epithelial ovarian carcinomas, lacking expression of both estrogen receptors and WT-1.

Rarely, mucinous neoplasms arising from primary ovarian teratomas lead to pseudomyxoma peritonei, but this is the exception rather than the rule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/83,89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,89,90</a>].

The same histology is seen in mucinous borderline neoplasms.

Two patterns of &quot;invasion&quot; of mucinous carcinomas have been described: infiltrate invasion and expansile growth pattern. The infiltrative type of invasion has obvious destructive stromal invasion in the form of glands, cell clusters, or individual cells haphazardly infiltrating the stroma, often with an accompanying desmoplastic stromal reaction. The infiltrative pattern of invasion meets the standard definition of invasive carcinoma with destructive stromal invasion and has a corresponding worse prognosis.</p><p>By contrast, the expansile growth pattern does not demonstrate obvious stromal invasion, but has complex architecture with back-to-back glands and minimal to no intervening stroma. The expansile pattern of growth has been referred to as &quot;noninvasive carcinoma&quot; by some experts and mucinous carcinoma with expansile growth that is tantamount to invasion by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. In our institution, we prefer to classify this as mucinous ovarian neoplasms with complex architectural growth pattern with no definite invasion, since destructive stromal invasion is not identified. The expansile pattern of mucinous neoplasm has also been associated with a more favorable prognosis, further supporting the idea that these neoplasms are not truly invasive carcinomas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1295683678\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunophenotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ovarian mucinous carcinoma of the ovary often expresses gastrointestinal markers, including CK20 and CDX2, in addition to expression of CK7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/92-94\" class=\"abstract_t\">92-94</a>].

These tumors are typically large at presentation with abundant hemorrhage and necrosis, and present at an advance stage. The characteristic histologic feature of these neoplasms is the intimate admixture of malignant epithelial and stromal elements. The malignant epithelial component most commonly resembles HGSC, although other subtypes have been reported, and the malignant stromal component usually contains hyperchromatic rounded to spindled cells with marked nuclear atypia and a high mitotic index. Heterologous elements such as cartilage, osteoid, and rhabdomyoblasts are also frequently observed. The stromal components are often positive, at least focally, for epithelial markers and like endometrial carcinosarcomas, the majority of ovarian carcinosarcomas are monoclonal, suggesting they are metaplastic carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>].

Thorough sampling of the neoplasm is required to rule out an invasive component (LGSC).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1295683757\"><span class=\"h2\">Microscopic pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key microscopic feature of serous borderline neoplasms is a serous epithelial proliferation consisting of epithelial stratification and tufting, with hierarchical branching of successively smaller papillae arising from larger, more centrally located papillae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F91229\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91229 \">picture 8</a>). Such epithelial proliferation and stratification must be present in at least 10 percent of the tumor to warrant a diagnosis of serous borderline neoplasm. In cysts with less than 10 percent serous budding and tufting, the diagnosis should be serous cystadenoma with focal borderline change.</p><p>Occasionally, the epithelial tufting and stratification can become more complex, leading to a cribriform pattern, or the neoplasm can assume a nonhierarchical branching pattern comprised of elongated micropapillae arising directly from a central large papillae. If the cribriform or micropapillary architecture constitutes greater than 10 percent of the neoplasm or 5 mm of confluent area, some experts designate the neoplasm as micropapillary serous carcinoma. There is current controversy if these neoplasms carry a worse prognosis and tend to behave more like LGSC in the absence of definite invasion. In our institution, we prefer to designate these as serous borderline neoplasm with cribriform <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> micropapillary architecture to alert the clinician to a potentially worse prognosis, while at the same time differentiating these neoplasms from those that truly have destructive stromal invasion (carcinoma).</p><p>In addition to more complex architectural patterns, approximately 10 percent of serous borderline neoplasms can have areas of microinvasion. Microinvasion is defined as isolated cells, cell clusters, or haphazard nests of cells measuring less than 5 mm that are invading into the stromal core of the papillae or cyst wall. The invasive cells often have abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, and so a definite desmoplastic stromal response can be difficult to identify. In other cases, the invasive nests elicit a prominent stromal response and resemble that seen in LGSC. By definition, the microinvasive focus must be smaller than 5 mm, although there can be several foci of microinvasion throughout the tumor. If the invasive component measures greater than 5 mm, the neoplasm should be classified as a LGSC arising in a borderline neoplasm.</p><p>Peritoneal implants on the serosal and omental surfaces are found in association with serous borderline neoplasm in approximately 35 percent of patients at the time of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. There is a high correlation between the presence of exophytic neoplasm on the surface of the ovary and the presence of implants. The term &quot;peritoneal implant&quot; is used rather than &quot;peritoneal metastases&quot; to convey that these are noninvasive. Peritoneal implants are classified as &quot;invasive&quot; or &quot;noninvasive&quot; based upon the presence of destructive stromal invasion at the site of implantation. Approximately 85 to 95 percent of all peritoneal implants in women with serous borderline neoplasm are noninvasive and are typically plastered on the peritoneal surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>These implants can also be found in the sinuses of peritoneal lymph nodes. Desmoplastic implants, on the other hand, also have a &quot;plastered on&quot; appearance, but elicit a prominent fibrous or desmoplastic response that consists of cellular fibrous tissue with epithelial nests imbedded within the reactive stroma. However, noninvasive desmoplastic implants do not appear to invade and destroy below the surface upon which they have implanted. Invasive implants consist of epithelial cells and nests that often elicit a desmoplastic response but also invade the surrounding tissue.</p><p>Distinguishing between invasive implants of a serous borderline neoplasm and metastatic LGSC requires exclusion of invasive LGSC in the ovary. Overall, invasive implants from an ovarian serous borderline neoplasm are uncommon, with only 4 to 13 percent of patients with high-stage disease serous borderline neoplasm having implants that qualify as &quot;invasive&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. At our institution, if invasive disease is identified in any site with a borderline neoplasm in the ovary, we interpret the case as LGSC arising in the setting of serous borderline neoplasm, as we feel it is confusing to classify a case simply as a borderline neoplasm if there is invasion in an implant. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1295683764\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunophenotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serous borderline neoplasms have an immunophenotype similar to LGSCs, with a low Ki67 proliferative rate; weak or wild-type p53 expression; and nuclear expression of WT-1, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor.

Mucinous borderline neoplasm is classified based upon the histologic appearance of the epithelial lining with two general types: the gastrointestinal type and the endocervical, or seromucinous, type.</p><p>Most mucinous borderline neoplasms are of the gastrointestinal type, in which the proliferating mucinous cells have a gastrointestinal-type appearance, most commonly that of goblet cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/81,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,83</a>].

The epithelial lining of both the gastrointestinal type and the endocervical type have only mild to moderate cytologic atypia and no invasive carcinoma is identified. If a mucinous borderline neoplasm exhibits marked nuclear atypia but lacks invasion, it is considered a mucinous borderline neoplasm with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia. Some experts refer to these as having intraepithelial carcinoma, although in our institution we prefer the term high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, given the lack of stromal invasion.</p><p>Like serous borderline neoplasms, approximately 10 to 20 percent of mucinous borderline neoplasms exhibit microinvasion. This is defined as single cells, clusters, or haphazard nests of cells that invade and destroy the underlying stroma with a size less than 5 mm. If definite stromal invasion greater than 5 mm is identified, the neoplasm should be classified as an invasive carcinoma. Unlike serous borderline neoplasms, peritoneal implants have not been associated with mucinous borderline neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>].

Squamous morules are common and can make it challenging to differentiate between borderline endometrioid neoplasm and invasive endometrioid carcinoma.

Noninvasive or borderline neoplastic counterparts exist for some subtypes. (See <a href=\"#H1295683442\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The five main subtypes of epithelial ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal carcinomas and their relative proportions are: high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC; 70 percent); endometrioid carcinoma (10 percent); clear cell carcinoma (10 percent); low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC; &lt;5 percent); and mucinous carcinoma (3 percent). (See <a href=\"#H5702129\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HGSC is the most common type of cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum. Most HGSC is stage III or IV at diagnosis and has a poor prognosis. Molecular evidence supports that transitional cell carcinoma is a subset of HGSC in which the epithelium is morphologically similar to malignant urothelium. (See <a href=\"#H1295683456\" class=\"local\">'High-grade serous carcinoma'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1295683700\" class=\"local\">'Transitional cell carcinoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LGSC is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage. However, these neoplasms are biologically distinct from HGSC and are slow-growing, indolent neoplasms with relative insensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy. LGSC is often found along with a noninvasive serous borderline component. Borderline serous neoplasms are more common than LGSC, and LGSC most likely represents progression of a serous borderline neoplasm. (See <a href=\"#H1295683499\" class=\"local\">'Low-grade serous carcinoma'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1295683728\" class=\"local\">'Serous borderline neoplasm'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometrioid carcinomas are typically low-grade and most often identified at an early stage. They are relatively sensitive to platinum chemotherapy. These factors contribute to a better prognosis, in general, than for serous carcinomas. However, high-grade endometrioid carcinoma is likely not a distinct neoplasm, but rather a subtype of HGSC. (See <a href=\"#H1295683542\" class=\"local\">'Endometrioid carcinoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometrioid ovarian carcinoma is associated with carcinoma of the endometrium in 15 to 20 percent of cases. In such cases, it must be determined whether the primary site is the ovary or the uterus, or whether there are synchronous neoplasms at both sites (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F91232\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91232 \">table 2</a>).

It is usually unilateral, presents at an early stage, and does not cause pseudomyxoma peritonei. However, other mucinous neoplasms of the ovary account for 10 to 15 percent of all ovarian neoplasms. These include: benign mucinous cystadenomas, mucinous borderline neoplasms, and metastases, most frequently from the gastrointestinal tract.
