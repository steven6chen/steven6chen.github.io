However, although a substantial proportion of incident dialysis patients may be judged to be at high risk, an AV fistula can often be placed and used. </p><p>The risk factors associated with failure of hemodialysis AV fistula maturation and failure of a mature AV fistula are reviewed here. The choice of hemodialysis AV access and placement and care of the AV fistula are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chronic hemodialysis vascular access&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arteriovenous fistula creation for hemodialysis and its complications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula maintenance and thrombosis prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2750062341\"><span class=\"h1\">USE OF RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although risk factors are important, risk stratification schemes based on demographic and clinical parameters fail to accurately identify individuals in whom arteriovenous (AV) fistula placement is futile. The most important determinant in the success of an AV fistula is the quality of the available vessels (ie, hemodynamic factors). Individualization based upon preprocedural vascular mapping is critical. As an example, an older black diabetic female with good vessels is a superior AV fistula candidate compared with a young white nondiabetic male with poor vessels. No patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) should be excluded from consideration for an AV fistula without vascular mapping and evaluation by an experienced hemodialysis access vascular surgeon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient evaluation and vascular mapping prior to placement of hemodialysis arteriovenous access&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While the goal of patient evaluation prior to access placement is to facilitate the placement of an AV fistula, failure of AV fistula maturation remains a major problem with serious clinical consequences, not least of which is prolonging the period of catheter dependency. Thus, the patient with a low likelihood of AV fistula maturation based upon an individualized evaluation might be better served by placement of an AV graft. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-access#H568349\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chronic hemodialysis vascular access&quot;, section on 'Recommended strategy for chronic hemodialysis vascular access'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4055174970\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of poor arteriovenous (AV) fistula maturation or subsequent AV fistula failure can be regarded as related to either hemodynamic factors, patient-related demographic or clinical factors, or other technical issues. Among these, hemodynamic factors are the most important.

In these cases, the creation of an AV access in the forearm using graft material may be the best option. The purpose is twofold. The AV graft will provide a useable dialysis access, and the veins in the upper arm may develop over time such that a secondary AV fistula may be possible, if the AV graft becomes problematic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

What constitutes the best access for this group of patients is controversial. Older age is a risk factor for decreased life expectancy on dialysis in comparison with the non-ESRD population; however, the presence of comorbid burden appears to have a stronger effect on survival compared with incremental age alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Advancing age largely acts as a surrogate for an increasing burden of comorbidity, particularly diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Overall, age as an isolated variable should not greatly affect access decisions. </p><p>Older age has been cited as a risk factor for failure of AV fistula maturation and long-term functional survival, but it has also been suggested that this is not the case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As with patient mortality, the problem relates to the clinical conditions associated with aging. Another problem in analyzing data related to age is the variability of the age groups being studied. In a meta-analysis involving 13 studies of dialysis access outcomes, the most commonly used age for &quot;older patients&quot; was &gt;65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, age &gt;75 years is associated with the highest incidence rate of ESRD (per <span class=\"nowrap\">million/year),</span> with those 65 to 74 years having the second highest incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Defining older age as a homogeneous group &gt;65 years may lead to skewed results. </p><p>Older patients lose renal function at a slower rate than is typical for younger patients, making it difficult to predict dialysis initiation time and plan for AV fistula placement. There is also a concern that older patients may die in the time interval between AV fistula creation and initiating dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The data below suggest that based upon increasing age (and an increased comorbidity burden), achieving a functional AV fistula may be more difficult; however, once established, patency appears to be comparable with that of younger age groups. </p><p>Based upon 2016 United States Renal Data System (USRDS) data, the average interval of time from AV fistula placement and first use for age categories 22 to 44, 45 to 64, 65 to 74, and &lt;75 years were 129, 132, 136, and 133 days, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. AV fistula use at 3 and 12 months by these age categories was 22 and 63, 25 and 67, 27 and 65, and 24 and 60 percent, respectively. The AV fistula failure rates for age categories 22 to 44, 45 to 64, 65 to 74, and &lt;75 years were 32, 34, 37, and 40 percent, respectively. &#160;</p><p>In a study of 525 patients who were followed for three years after AV fistula creation (based upon vascular mapping), there were no significant differences for the primary failure rate or primary patency rates at one, two, and three years between groups stratified by age (&lt;65, 65 to 75, and &gt;75 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, age &gt;75 years was associated with worse secondary patency (hazard ratio [HR] 1.90, 95% CI 1.15-3.14). In another study of 461 patients ranging in age from 65 to 94 (mean age 73 years), primary, primary assisted, and cumulative patencies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F70111\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70111 \">table 1</a>) were 60, 94, and 97 percent at 12 months and 45, 90, and 95 percent at 24 months, respectively, with a mean follow-up of 17 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. When the patients were stratified by age into 65 to 74-, 75 to 84-, and 85 to 94-year groups, there were no significant differences in AV fistula outcomes. In addition, a comparison of primary, primary assisted, and cumulative patency rates for older (&ge;65 years) compared with younger (&lt;65 years) patients also showed no difference.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2322929093\"><span class=\"h3\">Gender</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with older age, gender also presents several unique features related to dialysis and vascular access. </p><p>Males have a higher level of kidney function compared with females at the same level of serum creatinine as a result of greater muscle mass and creatinine generation. This is important to recognize because referrals for vascular access at a fixed level of serum creatinine would systematically refer women with more advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, although there are some conflicting data, several studies have shown that the rate of renal deterioration is slower in women compared with men, and women have improved renal survival and lower overall mortality compared with men (104 versus 123 per 1000 patient-years at risk) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/6,11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11-16</a>]. </p><p>Most investigations have found significant differences in outcomes of AV fistula creation when comparing males and females, although there are reports to the contrary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. One report indicated that female compared with male gender is a significant risk factor for failure of AV fistula maturation (hazard ratio 2.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. According to a review using the USRDS in 2016, females had a higher overall rate of maturation compared with in males (41.6 versus 31.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, AV fistula maturation was delayed in females in comparison to males, with a longer interval in days between access placement and first use (143 versus 127 days). More males were using AV fistulas at the initiation of dialysis (18.4 versus 14.8 percent). In addition, the duration of patency was shorter in females compared with in males, with AV fistula use at 3 and 12 months at 26.2 and 55.9 percent versus 27.9 and 70.6 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The reasons for these gender differences are not clear. It has been suggested that females have smaller vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]; however, comparative studies of preoperative vascular mapping have not supported this premise. In one study involving 106 females and 86 males, no significant difference in vein size was observed at any of 17 sites that were examined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, arterial size was significantly smaller in females at 3 of 12 different sites that were measured. These sites were all in the distal forearm. In another study involving 84 females and 105 males with preoperative vascular mapping, no differences in vein diameters were noted between the genders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, arterial differences were also noted. Arteries used for AV fistula construction were smaller in females in both forearm and upper arm placements, but in a comparison between successful and unsuccessful AV fistulas, there were no differences in either arterial or venous diameters in either the forearm or upper arm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1278209117\"><span class=\"h3\">Race/ethnicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Race/ethnicity</span> exerts an effect on the incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), incidence of ESRD, hospitalization rates, mortality rate on dialysis, and success of an AV fistula.

A study was conducted using ESRD Medical Evidence Report data to determine the correlation between risk factors in AV fistula use in 195,756 adult patients initiating outpatient hemodialysis therapy who had six or more months of prior nephrology care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The likelihood of patients in the black racial group beginning outpatient dialysis therapy using an AV fistula was 60 percent lower compared with whites, and for Hispanics, 10 percent lower compared with non-Hispanics. Similarly, using the white racial group as the reference, a review of ESRD data for 2016 showed that blacks were less likely to start dialysis using an AV fistula (odds ratio 0.77), as were Native Americans (odds ratio 0.81) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Racial and ethnic differences in AV fistula failure rates were also evident in the 2016 USRDS data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. By ethnicity, the highest AV fistula failure rate occurred in non-Hispanics, with a rate of 36.2 versus 29.2 percent in Hispanics. Within the non-Hispanic group, the highest failure rate occurred in blacks (38.2 percent), followed by whites (35.7 percent). Although the case numbers were small, the remaining failure rates were given as 33.9 percent for Native Americans, 30.3 percent for Asians, and 27.3 percent for other non-Hispanics.</p><p>AV fistula use at 12 months was also lowest in the black group at 58.5 percent, compared with a high of 75 percent in the Native American group, 66.9 percent in the white group, and 69.7 percent in the Asian group. AV fistula use in the total group of prevalent patients, those on dialysis for &gt;90 days, was lowest for the black group at 57.7 percent. The values for other groups were 68 percent for Hispanics, 64.9 percent for whites, 75.1 percent for Native Americans, and 67.5 percent for Asians.</p><p>While these values show a <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> difference, the reasons for the difference are not totally clear. While a genetic difference between different <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> groups cannot be totally discarded, there are definite differences in comorbidities between the groups. As an example, there is a higher incidence of obesity in black hemodialysis patients compared with non-Hispanic white patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This can adversely affect AV fistula creation but have a positive effect on patient longevity due to the &quot;obesity paradox.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H1841892746\" class=\"local\">'Obesity'</a> below.)</p><p>There is a higher rate of both type 2 diabetes and hypertension in the black racial group compared with the white group, and the risk of type 2 diabetes in the Native American group and Hispanics is even higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In addition, there is a well-documented disparity in healthcare delivery, including the utilization of preventive services, based upon <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> identifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Each of these factors has the potential to affect the development of ESRD and the creation of an AV fistula for dialysis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H632530194\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical comorbidities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical risk factors for AV fistula failure include the presence of cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, peripheral arterial disease, diabetes, and obesity. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3145999175\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiac disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an important comorbidity among patients with CKD. In 2016, 68.8 percent of patients &gt;66 years of age with CKD had some form of CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The prevalence of heart failure was 28.2 percent, and atrial fibrillation was present in 25.3 percent (nearly one-half of patients with heart failure also had atrial fibrillation). In addition, CVD presents a mortality risk for the ESRD patient. Death from CVD is 10 to 20 times higher in these patients compared with in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>The relationship between CVD and CKD is complex. The two share risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension. In addition, CKD is associated with changes that can increase the risk of developing CVD, such as abnormalities of mineral metabolism, anemia, volume overload, and CKD-associated vascular changes. CVD can also increase the risk of CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In addition, all forms of CVD have an increased incidence in CKD patients. This close relationship should be given consideration in dialysis access planning. Classification during the predialysis period according to the severity of cardiac symptoms in one of four categories (New York Heart Association Functional class I to IV) can help guide the selection of the most appropriate hemodialysis access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of heart failure caused by hemodialysis arteriovenous access&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The heart is a critical part of the dialysis access circuit, providing the driving force for blood flow necessary to meet the demands of the dialysis access. The creation of an AV fistula produces a hyperdynamic state that increases cardiac workload (volume-loaded state) and exerts significant effects on cardiac systolic and diastolic performance. Many of the early cardiac changes are physiological and adaptive; however, there are those that are maladaptive and deleterious to cardiac function and can lead to increased cardiac strain and poor subendocardial perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p>For patients with relatively normal cardiac function, the creation of an AV fistula should not be expected to have adverse effects. Some reports have noted an improvement in cardiovascular function with the creation of an AV dialysis access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, poor cardiac function adversely affects blood flow to the developing AV fistula. In addition, by increasing demand for cardiac output, the AV fistula can adversely affect the heart. </p><p>ESRD patients with decreased cardiac reserve are at risk for developing heart failure after AV access construction while those with a history of heart failure are at risk for worsening their condition. The deleterious effect of an AV fistula on the heart is directly proportional to access blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Since flow rate is generally higher with a brachial artery-based AV fistula compared with a radial artery-based AV access, the increase in cardiac output will be proportionately more. In a prospective study involving 96 hemodialysis patients, 31 patients with an upper-arm AV fistula had a significantly higher mean flow rate, cardiac output, and flow rate to cardiac output ratio compared with 65 patients with a lower-arm AV fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. This difference was evident even in the early maturation period of AV fistula creation. In an observational study of 562 predialysis patients, the location of AV fistula was closely related to the incidence of heart failure (40 percent in brachial-cephalic versus 8 percent in radial-cephalic AV fistula) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This suggests that in a patient with decreased cardiac function, if an AV fistula is created, a radial artery-based access with a lower flow rate would be desirable. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2688858909\"><span class=\"h3\">Peripheral arterial disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To achieve a functional AV fistula, the feeding brachial artery must increase baseline blood flow 10- to 20-fold to deliver the required blood volume for the fistula, as well as to supply distal tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. To do this, the artery must increase diameter sufficiently by remodeling to accommodate the increased flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Peripheral arterial disease interferes with this process. In one study involving 784 incident hemodialysis patients, a history of peripheral artery disease was associated with a 24 percent higher risk of AV fistula failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>Peripheral arterial disease changes in the vessel wall are characterized by intimal hyperplasia and calcification. At a histologic level, the presence of calcium deposits within the vessel wall of radial and brachial arteries in patients with CKD has been correlated with increased arterial stiffness and decreased elasticity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>In a study involving 59 patients in whom a radial-cephalic AV fistula was created, surgically obtained arterial specimens were examined for intimal hyperplasia, which was found in 45 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Patients with intimal hyperplasia were older and had a higher incidence of diabetes. A strong correlation was seen between AV fistula failure and intimal hyperplasia. In another study involving 72 diabetic patients, macrocalcification (M&ouml;nckeberg type) in the vessel wall (determined radiologically) correlated with decreased long-term AV fistula patency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. It is of interest that in another publication, microcalcification (determined histologically) had no effect on AV fistula maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p>Tests directed toward detection of feeding artery pathology have been advocated (eg, resistive index, assessment of arterial stiffness and elasticity, hyperemic response) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. A number of studies have reported a positive correlation between poor results in these tests and AV fistula failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/51-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-56</a>]. As an example, in a small study of patients undergoing AV fistula placement, the average radial artery elasticity index (ie, less stiffness) was higher in the group that developed a mature AV fistula compared with the group in whom the AV fistula failed; however, the brachial artery elasticity index was not significantly different in the success and failure groups. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H239147603\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary disease is also an important comorbidity in those with CKD. Its presence can materially affect the life expectancy of the dialysis patient and influence dialysis access choices. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-hypertension-in-hemodialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary hypertension in hemodialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A high incidence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) occurs in patients with CKD, where it is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and overall mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. Although the highest level occurs in the dialysis patient, an increased incidence has been reported prior to the initiation of dialysis. In one study of 211 patients, an incidence of 21.6, 24.1, and 31.7 percent was reported in nondialysis patients with CKD stages 3, 4, and 5, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p>Although not directly related to renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant cause of mortality in the population at large; this is no less so for the patient with ESRD. In 2013, the overall incidence in the United States was 6.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In the years 2000 to 2010, the prevalence of COPD in the patient age group 60 to 79 years (the fastest-growing ESRD age group) was 13.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3477706283\"><span class=\"h3\">Diabetes mellitus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although diabetes mellitus is generally listed as a risk factor for AV fistula failure, the diabetic state does not exert a direct adverse effect on the success of the access; however, the comorbidities associated with diabetes do have definite effect. As was the case with advanced age, diabetes serves as a surrogate for other comorbidities. Individuals with diabetes have a high risk for developing cardiovascular disease, including peripheral arterial disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The relationship is even greater in patients with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There is also an interplay between other clinical and demographic risk factors. Type 2 diabetes and hypertension occur more frequently in the black racial group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]; the incidence of AV fistula maturation failure is highest in this racial group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1278209117\" class=\"local\">'Race/ethnicity'</a> above.)</p><p>Since it is not diabetes as such but the associated burden of comorbidities that exerts the effect, pre-access clinical and hemodynamic evaluation can make a marked difference in achieving success with AV fistula creation. While some reports indicate a negative effect of diabetes on AV fistula success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-67</a>], most investigators have reported that diabetes is not significantly associated with primary AV fistula failure and that the success rate of a forearm AV fistula is comparable in patients with and without diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/50,68-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,68-71</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1841892746\"><span class=\"h3\">Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two issues are of importance when considering the creation of an AV fistula in the obese patient. First, obesity is a major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, these patients frequently present with the same issues as discussed for the patient with diabetes (see <a href=\"#H3477706283\" class=\"local\">'Diabetes mellitus'</a> above). The second is the technical issue related to the depth of the vessels used to create the fistula. An added consideration is the obesity paradox (ie, higher body mass index [BMI] is paradoxically associated with better survival among renal failure patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74</a>]. This, in addition to the fact that morbidly obese patients may be excluded from transplant consideration, means that their accesses must last longer than those of other patients. </p><p>When presented with an obese patient, there is no reason to avoid the creation of an AV fistula, but evaluation of hemodynamic factors by vascular mapping becomes particularly important. A retrospective cohort analysis was performed using the USRDS Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Wave II data set to evaluate the relationships between obesity and vascular access outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Obesity was associated only with poorer AV fistula maturity at the highest BMI quartile (&ge;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> and not with increased AV fistula revision rates or failure. However, in another study comparing obese with nonobese patients, although the likelihood of fistula placement and primary patency rates were the same, secondary patency was significantly lower in obese patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. It has been suggested that the decreased secondary patency in these patients could be due to soft tissue compression of the venous outflow of the upper extremity in the adducted position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. </p><p>In addition, a technical problem can occur in obese patients related to the depth of the veins, which tend to be deep due to the adiposity of the extremity, particularly in the upper arm. If the AV fistula is located too deeply from the skin surface, a procedure can be performed to elevate the fistula, which has been reported to be very successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Alternatively, lipectomy or liposuction has also been proposed as a means to minimize the depth of AV fistulas in obese arms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/79-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-82</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H269443342\"><span class=\"h2\">Technical</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3794470592\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The training and experience of the surgeon available to create AV access vary and can affect the success of AV fistula creation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/83-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-88</a>]. Surgical training is key to both AV fistula placement and outcomes. In a study designed to investigate whether intensity of surgical training influenced type of vascular access placed and AV fistula survival, prospective data from 12 countries in the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) were analyzed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Significant predictors of AV fistula versus AV graft placement included number of AV fistulas placed during training and degree of emphasis on vascular access creation during training. During training, United States (US) surgeons created fewer AV fistulas (US mean 16 versus 39 to 426 in other countries) and noted less emphasis on vascular access placement compared with surgeons elsewhere. The risk of primary AV fistula failure was 34 percent lower when placed by surgeons who created &gt;25 (compared with &lt;25) AV fistulas during training. However, no difference was noted between categories of 25 to 75 or &gt;75 AV fistulas created during training. Neither the number of years the surgeon had been placing vascular accesses nor the number of years since surgical training was significantly related to AV fistula success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3053713048\"><span class=\"h3\">Creating the AV fistula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Related to training and experience is the appropriate choice of vessel and conduct of the procedure used to create the hemodialysis AV fistula.

Most patients have more than one risk factor, and the burden increases with age. It is difficult for the clinician to determine the relative importance of these potential risk factors and to assess the effect of combinations when assessing the likelihood of achieving a functional AV fistula in the individual patient. While evaluating risk factors is important, risk stratification schemes have failed to accurately identify individuals in whom AV fistula placement is futile. While comorbid conditions affecting vascular access success become increasingly more common with age, they are not necessarily present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Further, although potential demographic and clinical factors may be relevant, the most important determinant is the quality of the available vessels. Thus, no patient with end-stage renal disease should be excluded from consideration for an AV fistula without vascular mapping and evaluation by an experienced hemodialysis vascular access surgeon. Decisions should be based on the individual patient status as determined by the clinical comorbidities that are present. </p><p>A study was conducted toward the development of an algorithm to be used in assessing individual patients having a combination of risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The goals of the study were to identify clinical characteristics that predicted failure of AV fistula maturation and to develop and validate a risk equation using these characteristics to stratify patients according to their risk. A clinical prediction rule was used to assign a prediction score ranging from 0 to 10.5. These scores were then used to define four risk categories: low risk (score &lt;2), moderate risk (score 2 to 3), high risk (score 3 to 7), and very high risk (score &gt;7). The algorithm was externally validated using 445 patients receiving a new AV fistula derived from five large dialysis centers. The four defined categories predicted the risk of failure to mature as 24, 34, 50, and 69 percent, respectively. The authors suggested that this scoring system could be used to guide the aggressiveness with which the individual patient is evaluated prior to dialysis access placement and postoperatively to detect failure maturation. As an example, in the low-risk patient, vascular mapping by physical examination only may be possible with routine postoperative monitoring, while the patient in the high-risk category might require angiographic evaluation (both vein and artery) and very close postoperative monitoring, anticipating the need for aggressive intervention to facilitate maturation.</p><p>In a later study, 195,756 incident adult dialysis patients with an AV fistula who had been followed for at least six months by nephrologists prior to initiation of dialysis were examined based upon the presence of risk factors for AV fistula failure of maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The risk factors for AV fistula failure, determined by logistic regression, were substantially different from those predicted by the clinical prediction algorithm above. Based upon a comparison with the low-risk group, the likelihood of AV fistula use was 0.90 (95% CI 0.88-0.93) for the moderate-risk group, 0.80 (95% CI 0.78-0.83) for the high-risk group, and 0.68 (95% CI 0.63-0.73) for the very-high-risk group. </p><p>In assessing the importance of risk factors, it is important to realize that these two studies are based upon different patient populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/30,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,33</a>]. The first proposed a scoring system to predict problems with AV fistula maturation and emphasizes the importance of using this data in presurgical selection and postsurgical management of individual patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The second study demonstrates actual prevalence of AV fistula utilization, the results, presumably, a reflection of presurgical selection and postsurgical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3771174719\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recognition of risk factors, especially the presence of multiple risk factors, is important in planning arteriovenous (AV) access creation for hemodialysis.

Individualization is critically important.

Although patients with poor-quality vessels are not ideal candidates for an AV fistula initially, a secondary fistula may be possible after a period of AV graft use, if the AV graft becomes problematic.
