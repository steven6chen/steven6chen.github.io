Victims can be young and apparently healthy, and while many of these deaths are unexplained, a substantial number harbor underlying undiagnosed cardiovascular disease. As a result, there is great interest in early identification of at-risk individuals for whom appropriate activity restrictions can be implemented to minimize the risk of SCD.</p><p>The majority of SCD events in athletes are due to malignant arrhythmias, usually sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). In individuals with certain cardiac disorders (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, etc), athletics may increase the likelihood of <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> in two ways: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In certain susceptible individuals (ie, with inherited arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy), prolonged physical training may induce changes in cardiac structure (eg, interstitial fibrosis, disruption of normal myocardial architecture, dilation of right and left ventricle) that may create pathologic arrhythmogenic substrate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The immediate physiologic demands of intense athletics (eg, hemodynamic overload, catecholamine release, electrolyte imbalance) may trigger malignant arrhythmias in susceptible individuals with underlying cardiac abnormalities.</p><p/><p>The potential for SCD associated with athletic activity generates two questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How should individuals be identified prior to initiating athletic activity?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What restrictions (if any) should be placed upon individuals with known cardiovascular disease?</p><p/><p>Answers to these questions are complicated and controversial and vary based upon three factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The age of the individual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nature of the activity (ie, competitive versus recreational athletics)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The type of underlying heart disease</p><p/><p>This topic will review the major etiologies of SCD in athletes and recommendations for participation in sports in the presence of various cardiac abnormalities. The broader range of arrhythmias and conduction disturbances common in athletes, as well as the recommended approaches to preparticipation screening of athletes, are presented separately.

Such sports programs primarily include apparently normal and healthy individuals over the age of 35, although many participants are greater than 50 or 60 years of age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Competitive athletes &ndash; Competitive athletes engage in organized team or individual sports in which there is regular competition, placing a premium on achievement. This definition implies that individuals are regularly engaged in high levels of training and competition and may not have the will or the judgment to limit their activity. This most frequently applies to high school, college, and professional sports.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recreational athletes &ndash; Recreational athletes generally participate for health <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> enjoyment purposes and do not typically have the same pressures to excel. Activity levels may still be vigorous, and the distinction from competitive athletics may be elusive in the individual case. However, defining recreational athletics separately permits the development of guidelines for noncompetitive athletes with cardiovascular disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10177261\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPETITIVE VERSUS RECREATIONAL ATHLETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The literature on SCD during exertion has largely focused on competitive athletics. However, some recreational athletics can be as vigorous as competitive sport, so recreational activity limitations are also important in individuals with one of the cardiovascular diseases commonly associated with SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The balance between the risks and benefits of athletic activity depends upon several factors, including baseline fitness level, the nature and intensity of athletic activity, and the presence and extent of cardiac disease.</p><p>For patients with a congenital disorder, with either structural or arrhythmic substrate, the possible increased risk associated with participation in athletic activity generally requires some restriction on athletic activity. However, it must be acknowledged that these restrictions are usually based on expert opinion and not controlled studies. In general, patients with known genetic disorders that predispose to SCD (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right [left] ventricular cardiomyopathy, Marfan syndrome, long QT syndrome) should avoid recreational activities with the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Burst&quot; exertion, involving rapid acceleration and deceleration, as is common in sprints, basketball, tennis, and soccer. Activities with stable energy expenditure, such as jogging, biking on level terrain, and lap swimming are preferred.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extreme environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, and altitude) that impact blood volume and electrolytes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systematic and progressive training load focused on achieving higher levels of conditioning and excellence.</p><p/><p>Patients with unusual or high-risk clinical features may require greater restriction. These features include a history of syncope or presyncope, prior cardiac surgery, prior arrhythmic episodes, or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. However, for most other individuals, including those with stable coronary heart disease, the overall benefits of regular exercise far outweigh the risks. A prudent and gradually progressive exercise program is appropriate in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise and fitness in the prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The benefits and risks of exercise&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE OF SCD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is widely acknowledged that SCD is the leading medical cause of death in athletes, although its exact incidence remains unclear. The best available evidence, together with a close examination of reporting methods for case identification and population definitions, suggests that an overall incidence of between <strong>1:50,000 and 1:100,000 per year in young athletes</strong> is a reasonable estimate based on existing information from retrospective cohort studies and prospective observational and cross-sectional studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. This rate is notably higher in older adults, closer to 1:7000 healthy adult athletes per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Incidence data are imprecise since most are derived from retrospective analyses, and incidence varies depending upon the intensity of exercise, the athletic population considered, the time period of observation, and whether the definition of athletic SCD encompasses SCD outside of <span class=\"nowrap\">sport/exercise</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. Use of media reports or catastrophic insurance claims as the primary method for case identification has been demonstrated to underestimate (by approximately 50 percent) the risk of SCD in athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Male athletes are consistently found to be at greater risk, and there appears to be a disproportionately higher risk among male African American athletes. </p><p>Using data from the Rescu Epistry cardiac arrest database, which contains data from all out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrests (SCA, which includes deaths and resuscitated arrests) attended by paramedics in the province of Ontario, Canada, investigators retrospectively reviewed the incidence of SCA between 2009 and 2014 among an estimated 350,000 competitive athletes ages 12 to 45 years (in total 2.1 million athlete-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Among the 3825 out-of-hospital SCA presumed to be cardiac in nature that occurred over the six years, 74 were identified as occurring during or within one hour of sports activities (16 during competitive sports, 58 during recreational sports). Although the overall rate of SCA in athletes was 0.76 per 100,000 athlete-years, 44 percent survived to hospital discharge, leading to an overall rate of SCD of 0.42 per 100,000 athlete-years. The incidence rate was somewhat higher among athletes ages 12 to 17 years (SCA rate 1.17 per 100,000 athlete-years; SCD rate 0.65 per 100,000 athlete-years) but still lower than prior SCD estimates of 1:50,000 athletes per year.</p><p>The magnitude of the problem and the challenges inherent in screening are illustrated in reports of arrhythmic events associated with major endurance sporting events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. As an example, in a study examining SCD in 215,413 marathon runners participating in one of two marathons over a 19-year period, the following findings were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SCD occurred in four individuals during or immediately following the marathon, an incidence of approximately 1 in 50,000. This is substantially lower than the annual risk of premature death in the general population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>None of the four subjects had prior cardiac symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two of the four had completed several previous marathons.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three of the four had coronary artery disease on autopsy, although none had a previous infarction.</p><p/><p>Thus, the incidence of SCD in marathon runners is very low, and in this population, it appears unlikely that even a carefully taken medical history or routine screening with an electrocardiogram (ECG) or echocardiogram would have revealed potential risk. Although the incidence of SCD among marathon runners is low (one death per 215,000 hours), it is higher than for other types of exercise, such as noncompetitive jogging (one death per 396,000 hours), cross-country skiing (one death per 607,000 hours), or general, noncompetitive exercise (one death per 375,000 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY OF SUDDEN DEATH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Structural heart disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SCD in athletes often occurs in the presence of structural heart disease, although the underlying disorder is often undetected until the presenting arrhythmic event. Structural heart disease can increase the risk for SCD by one or more of the following mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By far the most frequent mechanisms are ventricular tachyarrhythmias, which are commonly due to reentrant arrhythmias that develop in abnormal myocardium <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> areas of fibrotic replacement of myocardial tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other possible mechanisms include bradyarrhythmia or asystole due to extension of the pathologic process into the conduction system, causing complete heart block without a reliable escape focus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syncope, in addition to arrhythmic causes, may result from cyanosis during exercise in the setting of certain congenital lesions with right-to-left shunts and from left ventricular outflow tract obstruction as is observed in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissection of the great vessels, as in patients with Marfan syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Athletes &lt;35 years of age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several large series have evaluated SCD in athletes less than 35 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/5,15-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15-22</a>]. In most cases, structural heart disease was present. When present, the most common structural heart diseases include HCM, anomalous origin of a coronary artery, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), myocarditis, and coronary atherosclerosis, albeit with some variation among the different series.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 1435 young competitive athletes from a United States registry in whom cardiovascular disease was evident on post-mortem examination following SCD, HCM (36 percent) and anomalous origin of a coronary artery accounted for more than half of the cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cohort of over six million military recruits in the United States (mean age 19, range 17 to 35), among whom 126 nontraumatic sudden deaths occurred (including 108 [86 percent] related to exercise), anomalous origin of a coronary artery (33 percent), myocarditis (20 percent), coronary atherosclerosis (16 percent), and HCM (13 percent) accounted for over three-quarters of the structural abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series from the United Kingdom Regional Registry of 357 consecutive athletes with SCD between 1994 and 2014 (mean age 29 years), sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS), likely representing undiagnosed primary electrical disease, was the most prevalent cause of death (42 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Myocardial disease was detected in 40 percent of cases, including idiopathic left ventricular hypertrophy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibrosis (16 percent), ARVC (13 percent), and HCM (6 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A different distribution was noted in a series of 49 athletes under age 35 with SCD from northern Italy, an area with a known higher prevalence of ARVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

A number of inherited arrhythmia syndromes predispose individuals to SCD, and the heart is usually structurally normal in these patients. Examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long QT syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital long QT syndrome: Epidemiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brugada syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brugada-syndrome-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brugada syndrome: Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and other polymorphic ventricular tachycardias with a normal QT interval&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short QT syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-qt-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short QT syndrome&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>In addition, in individuals with structurally normal hearts, arrhythmic events may be precipitated by trauma or occur as <span class=\"nowrap\">sporadic/idiopathic</span> phenomena, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Commotio cordis, in which SCD results from being struck in the precordium with a projectile object such as a baseball, hockey puck, or fist (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=commotio-cordis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Commotio cordis&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early repolarization syndrome (see <a href=\"#H3085169658\" class=\"local\">'Early repolarization syndrome'</a> below)</p><p/><p>Finally, several case reports describe SCD in young athletes who had no previously known heart disease but were taking androgens for performance enhancement; cardiac hypertrophy or myocarditis were found at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. It is not possible to establish causality in these sporadic cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-androgens-and-other-hormones-by-athletes#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of androgens and other hormones by athletes&quot;, section on 'Side effects and complications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">STRUCTURAL ABNORMALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH SCD</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persons with a probable or unequivocal clinical diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) should not participate in most competitive sports with the possible exception of those that are low intensity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105651\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105651 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. This recommendation is independent of age, gender, and phenotypic appearance and does not differ for those athletes with or without symptoms, left ventricular (LV) outflow obstruction, prior treatment with drugs, or major interventions including surgery, alcohol septal ablation, pacemaker, or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Some moderate-intensity and many low-intensity recreational activities are generally considered to be safe when performed in moderation, including biking, doubles tennis, swimming laps, golf, and skating. Lifting weights with weight-training machines may be safe, but intense static (isometric) activity may induce a Valsalva maneuver and exacerbate an LV outflow tract gradient.</p><p>HCM is a relatively common disease, occurring in approximately 1 out of 200 individuals in the general population. In most athletes with SCD due to HCM, the diagnosis of HCM was not previously established. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Etiology of sudden death'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-assessment-and-management-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-and-sudden-cardiac-death-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Assessment and management of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the screening and evaluation of athletes, a unique challenge involves distinguishing LV hypertrophy (LVH) due to HCM from physiologic increases in LV wall thickness, cavity size, and mass that develop in response to intensive endurance training (ie, &quot;athlete's heart&quot;). Imaging testing (echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance [CMR]) and, on occasion, family screening play a role in distinguishing HCM from athlete's heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F87658\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87658 \">figure 2</a>). Detailed discussions of the diagnosis of HCM and making the distinction between HCM and athlete&rsquo;s heart are presented separately.

Some data suggest a relatively low risk of ventricular arrhythmias and SCD in athletes with HCM regardless of the continuation or discontinuation of training and competition. In a cohort of 35 Italian athletes with HCM who were advised to discontinue training and competition (31 who were low risk by the ESC algorithm, 27 who were low risk by the AHA algorithm), 20 patients stopped exercising, but 15 continued to exercise against clinician advice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Over an average follow-up of nine years, approximately 2 percent of patients per year developed symptoms (syncope, palpitations), and only one cardiac arrest occurred (in an athlete but not during exercise), with no significant difference in the event rates between the sedentary and exercising groups.

At present, no compelling data are available that would preclude these patients from competitive sports, particularly in the absence of a family history of sudden death.

The presumed mechanism of SCD involves repeated bouts of silent ischemia secondary to an exaggeration of a sharp angle in the aberrant origin that occurs with exercise, especially as the artery traverses an expanded aorta and pulmonary arterial trunk. Chronic ischemia is considered responsible for myocardial fibrosis representing the ultimate substrate for induction of tachyarrhythmias during exercise.</p><p>Patients with congenital coronary anomalies may present with syncope or presyncope, especially with exercise and with angina in a limited proportion of cases.

Clinicians should be aware that competitive athletes may minimize symptoms that occur during exertion.</p><p/><p>In patients over age 35, the most frequent cause of exercise-related SCD is CAD. Ventricular arrhythmias can originate from myocardial scar (from prior MIs), or from acute ischemia. In addition, ischemia during exertion can result either from fixed, chronic coronary stenosis that precludes increased myocardial oxygen delivery during exercise (ie, demand ischemia), or from an acute coronary syndrome. Autopsy examination of adults with exercise-related SCD usually reveals advanced CAD <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an acute coronary lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/24,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,63</a>].

However, it is likely that the risk of a cardiac event during exercise increases with the presence of increasingly severe CAD, type of lesion (soft plaques are at higher risk of rupture), left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, and ventricular arrhythmias, as well as with the intensity of the competitive sport and the individual's effort. As a result, risk assessment should involve a full evaluation of cardiac status.</p><p>Prior to initiating systematic training or competition, athletes with previously documented CAD should have an assessment of LV function. Exercise testing should be done, both to assess exercise capacity and to determine the extent of ischemia. Whenever possible, such testing should be performed while the patient is taking prescribed medications and should approximate the cardiovascular and metabolic demands of the planned athletic activity.

Victims can be young and apparently healthy, and while many of these deaths are unexplained, a substantial number harbor underlying undiagnosed cardiovascular disease. The majority of SCD events in athletes are due to malignant arrhythmias, usually ventricular tachycardia (VT) degenerating into ventricular fibrillation (VF) or primary VF itself. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The balance between the risks and benefits of athletic activity depends upon several factors, including baseline fitness level, the nature and intensity of athletic activity, and the presence and extent of cardiac disease. Although there are exceptions, for most individuals, the overall benefits of regular exercise far outweigh the risks. (See <a href=\"#H10177261\" class=\"local\">'Competitive versus recreational athletics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of SCD among young athletes is actually quite low, estimated to be between 1:50,000 and 1:100,000 young athletes per year. This rate is notably higher in older adults, closer to 1:7000 healthy adult athletes per year. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Incidence of SCD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The potential etiologies of SCD include certain structural heart diseases, inherited arrhythmia syndromes, and coronary heart disease; the exact distribution of etiologies varies according to age and geography, among other variables. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Etiology of sudden death'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some level of activity restriction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105651\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105651 \">figure 1</a>) is recommended for nearly all individuals with underlying heart disease. The precise restrictions vary depending on the underlying disease process and other comorbidities and are discussed in detail within the body of the topic.
