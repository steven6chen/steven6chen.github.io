Over 50 percent of uremic men complain of symptoms that include erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and marked declines in the frequency of intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. These problems may improve but rarely normalize with the institution of maintenance dialysis, commonly resulting in a decreased quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/2,3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,5</a>]. By comparison, a well-functioning renal transplant is much more likely to restore sexual activity; however, some features of reproductive function may remain impaired, particularly reduced libido and erectile dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Sexual dysfunction in uremia is primarily organic in nature, as demonstrated by abnormal nocturnal penile tumescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of male sexual dysfunction&quot;</a>.) It is presumed that the uremic milieu plays an important role in the genesis of this problem. Other organic (and not necessarily uremic) factors that may contribute to erectile dysfunction include peripheral neuropathy, autonomic dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease, and pharmacologic therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">STRESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychologic and physical stresses that may contribute to disturbances in sexual function are also commonly present in patients with chronic renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/2,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-8</a>]. One study surveyed a randomly selected group of 68 patients treated with chronic peritoneal dialysis about their actual and desired level of sexual function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The following results were obtained:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sixty-three percent reported never having intercourse.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nineteen percent had intercourse less than or equal to two times per month.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eighteen percent had intercourse more than two times per month.</p><p/><p>There was no difference among the three groups with respect to age, the amount of dialysis received, or the serum albumin concentration. Standard psychologic questionnaires indicated that the patients who never had intercourse were more depressed and anxious and assessed their overall quality of life at a level that was significantly lower than that of the other two groups. In this uncontrolled study, however, it is not possible to determine if the stress was the cause of the infrequent intercourse or vice versa. Similar observations have been made in patients on maintenance hemodialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-TESTICULAR FUNCTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Spermatogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic renal failure is associated with impaired spermatogenesis and testicular damage, often leading to infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. Semen analysis typically shows a decreased volume of ejaculate, oligo- or complete azoospermia, and a low percentage of motile sperm. Testicular histology shows decreased spermatogenic activity varying from reduced numbers of mature spermatocytes to complete aplasia of germinal elements. Other findings include damage to the seminiferous tubules, atrophy of Sertoli cells, and interstitial fibrosis and calcifications.</p><p>The factors responsible for testicular damage in uremia are not well understood. It is possible that plasticizers in dialysis tubing, such as phthalate, may play a role in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Testosterone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uremia also impairs gonadal steroidogenesis. The serum total and free testosterone concentrations are typically reduced, although the binding capacity and concentration of sex hormone-binding globulin are normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Low serum testosterone levels are associated with increased mortality in dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Another manifestation of diminished testosterone secretory capacity is the subnormal and delayed testosterone response to the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), which has the biologic effect of luteinizing hormone (LH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. By comparison, the serum estradiol concentration is typically normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Gonadotropins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The serum concentration of LH is elevated in uremic men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]; this is due to diminished testosterone feedback.</p><p>Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion is also elevated, although to a more variable degree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. Elevated FSH levels are probably the result of decreased testosterone and inhibin, a Sertoli cell product. The plasma FSH concentration tends to be highest in those uremic patients with the most severe damage to seminiferous tubules and presumably the lowest levels of inhibin. It has been suggested that increased FSH levels may portend a poor prognosis for recovery of spermatogenic function after renal transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Prolactin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevated plasma prolactin concentrations are found in the majority of dialyzed men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] due to a threefold increase in prolactin production. The metabolic clearance rate of prolactin is also decreased but only by 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, the control of prolactin is abnormal. As an example, dopamine infusion or the administration of oral L-dopa fails to decrease basal prolactin levels. On the other hand, procedures that normally increase prolactin secretion, such as arginine infusion, insulin-induced hypoglycemia, or thyrotropin-releasing hormone infusion, elicit no or only a blunted response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>The clinical significance of enhanced prolactin release in uremic men is incompletely understood. In men who have normal renal function, hyperprolactinemia tends to cause a decrease in LH and consequently in testosterone, independently causing hypogonadism. In men with renal failure, however, LH is higher than normal. When <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a> was administered to men with renal failure, it lowered prolactin levels to near normal, but the effect on libido and potency was inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>] and the incidence of side effects, particularly hypotension, was high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]; the incidence with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabergoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabergoline</a> would be expected to be much lower.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Gynecomastia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gynecomastia occurs in approximately 30 percent of men on maintenance hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This problem most often develops during the initial months of dialysis and then tends to regress as dialysis continues. The pathogenesis of gynecomastia in this setting is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] but may be related to starvation-refeeding gynecomastia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-causes-of-gynecomastia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and causes of gynecomastia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough history and physical examination are essential first steps in the evaluation of the uremic male with sexual dysfunction. The principal complaint is impotence, which occurs in approximately 80 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Among such individuals, the following findings may suggest a particular cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a history of normal erectile function prior to the onset of renal disease may have a secondary cause, such as a neuropathy or peripheral vascular disease. The presence of a neurogenic bladder suggests an underlying neuropathy, while findings of peripheral vascular disease point toward inadequate penile blood flow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lack of secondary sexual characteristics combined with small, soft testes suggests hypogonadism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ingestion of a number of medications, such as beta blockers and tricyclic antidepressants, may be a cause of erectile dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low serum testosterone indicates hypogonadism; an elevated luteinizing hormone (LH) indicates that the hypogonadism is due to a testicular cause.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated serum prolactin can also cause a low testosterone.</p><p/><p>Among those without an obvious cause of impotence after an initial evaluation, consideration should be given to a psychologic difficulty, such as stress (as above) or depression. The administration of a nocturnal penile tumescence test may help distinguish between an organic and a psychologic disorder; the absence of an erection during sleep suggests underlying organic dysfunction. A positive test, however, does not exclude a physical cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of male sexual dysfunction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many different tests may be performed to help discriminate between a neurogenic or vascular cause; however, such examinations are principally performed in men who do not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a> (see below) and who may therefore be considered for a penile prosthesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of uremic men with sexual dysfunction begins by maximizing the delivered dose of dialysis, discontinuing culprit medications (if possible), and correcting the anemia of chronic renal disease. As an example, the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to raise the hematocrit to 33 to 36 percent may enhance sexual function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. It is likely that the associated improvement in wellbeing probably plays an important role in this response (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-anemia-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of anemia in nondialysis chronic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyporesponse-to-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyporesponse to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>), but there is also evidence of normalization of the pituitary gonadal feedback mechanism: Testosterone levels are increased, along with reductions toward normal in the serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and prolactin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p>Subsequent treatment is based upon findings from the history, physical examination, and possibly laboratory studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74246\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef74246 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Phosphodiesterase inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sildenafil</a>, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, is effective therapy for erectile dysfunction in both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients (as well as kidney transplant patients) and is often used as first-line therapy for psychologic, vascular, or neurogenic causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/23,29-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,29-36</a>]. As an example, a systematic review of three randomized, controlled trials that included 101 patients found that, compared with placebo, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors significantly improved erectile function in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In the largest placebo-controlled study in hemodialysis patients, sildenafil was highly effective (85 versus 9.5 percent improvement for placebo) and well tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, a large number of individuals were excluded from this study, including those older than 70 years of age or taking nitrates <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> patients with cirrhosis, diabetes, angina, severe anemia, a recent stroke or myocardial infarction, or an anatomically abnormal penis. Furthermore, in a study examining the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil, the drug was not cleared by hemodialysis. In addition, intradialytic hypotension did not occur when a single 50 mg dose was given to 15 men prior to hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Other phosphodiesterase inhibitors are available for clinical use, but have not been adequately studied in patients undergoing renal replacement therapy.</p><p>To limit the possibility of hypotension among hemodialysis patients, some clinicians recommend the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a> on nondialysis days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], although one small study found that sildenafil did not promote intradialytic hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Concurrent use of sildenafil and nitrates in any form, regularly or intermittently, is contraindicated.

The effectiveness of such therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antidepressant medications in uremic men is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Dopamine agonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bromocriptine</a> has shown some efficacy in improving sexual function in men with increased serum prolactin. However, its usefulness has been limited in some, but not all, studies by a relatively high frequency of side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/20,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,38,39</a>]. Thus, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabergoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabergoline</a>, which causes nausea much less often than bromocriptine and is at least as effective in treating hyperprolactinemia, should therefore be tried first (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a>). Other dopaminergic agonists, such as lisuride, also seem to be better tolerated than bromocriptine but have only been used in small, short-term studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Testosterone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Replacement of testosterone in men who have a low serum testosterone concentration generally results in clinical improvement in other forms of hypogonadism (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-treatment-of-male-hypogonadism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Testosterone treatment of male hypogonadism&quot;</a>). By contrast, the administration of testosterone to uremic men usually fails to restore libido or potency, despite normalized serum testosterone and reduced LH and FSH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>].

In a review of the experience of one renal impotence clinic, vacuum tumescence devices were utilized in 26 impotent patients, all of whom had a normal pituitary-gonadal axis or hypogonadism corrected with testosterone replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

It is supplied in an applicator that is inserted in the urethra.

The major side effects of intrapenile alprostadil therapy are penile pain, priapism, and bleeding. Given the presence of platelet dysfunction with uremia, intracavernosal injections should be used with <strong>caution</strong> in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Zinc</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Zinc deficiency has also been suggested as a cause of gonadal failure. Uremic patients are often deficient in zinc, probably due to reduced dietary intake, zinc malabsorption, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> possible leaching of zinc by dialysis equipment. In a controlled trial, supplemental zinc resulted in significant increases in the plasma testosterone concentration and sperm counts, as well as significant declines in LH and FSH levels as compared with a control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].
