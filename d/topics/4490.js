Try these steps:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat foods that have a lot of fiber. Good choices are fruits, vegetables, prune juice, and cereal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52349\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52349 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink plenty of water and other fluids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When you feel the need to go to the bathroom, go to the bathroom. Don't hold it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take laxatives. These are medicines that help make bowel movements easier to get out. Some are pills that you swallow. Others go into the rectum. These are called &quot;suppositories.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33678086\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your symptoms are new or not normal for you</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You do not have a bowel movement for a few days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The problem comes and goes, but lasts for longer than 3 weeks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are in a lot of pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have other symptoms that also worry you (for example, bleeding, weakness, weight loss, or fever)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other people in your family have had colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33678093\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests I should have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will decide which tests you should have based on your age, other symptoms, and individual situation. There are lots of tests, but you might not need any.</p><p>Here are the most common tests doctors use to find the cause of constipation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rectal exam &ndash; Your doctor will look at the outside of your anus. He or she will also use a finger to feel inside the opening.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy &ndash; For these tests, the doctor puts a thin tube into your anus. Then, he or she advances the tube into your large intestine. The large intestine is also called the colon. The tube has a camera attached to it, so the doctor can look inside your intestines. During these tests, the doctor can also take samples of tissue to look at under a microscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52258\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52258 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>X-rays or MRI &ndash; These create images of the inside of your body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manometry studies &ndash; Manometry allows the doctor to measure the pressure inside the rectum at various points. It can help the doctor find out if the muscles that control bowel movements are working right. The test also shows whether the person's rectum can feel normally.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33678100\"><span class=\"h1\">How is constipation treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on what is causing your constipation. First, your doctor will want you to try eating more fiber and drinking more water. If that doesn't help, your doctor might suggest:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that you swallow or put in your rectum</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changing the medicines you are taking for other conditions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A treatment called an &quot;enema.&quot; For this treatment, a doctor or nurse will squirt water into your rectum. He or she might also use a thin tool to help break up bowel movements that are still inside you.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biofeedback &ndash; This is a technique that teaches you to relax your muscles so you can let go and push bowel movements out.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33678107\"><span class=\"h1\">Can constipation be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chances of getting constipation again by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eating a diet that is full of fiber (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52349\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52349 \">table 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drinking water and other fluids during the day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Going to the bathroom at regular times every day</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33678114\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhoids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hemorrhoids (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-adolescents-and-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in adolescents and adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-fiber-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High-fiber diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-symptoms-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pregnancy symptoms (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Constipation in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
