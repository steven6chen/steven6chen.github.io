The goal of this plan is to prevent another heart attack and lower your chance of dying prematurely from heart disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29400752\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to take medicines?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Most people need to take at least 3 heart medicines every day. Doctors can prescribe different types of heart medicines. The ones you take will depend on your heart condition and how your heart attack was treated. Some heart medicines help prevent chest pain and other heart symptoms. Other heart medicines help prevent future heart attacks and help you live longer. To prevent another heart attack, you will probably need to take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>, a medicine called a &quot;beta blocker,&quot; and a cholesterol-lowering medicine.</p><p>If you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes (high blood sugar), your doctor will likely prescribe medicines to treat those conditions. Having untreated high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes can increase your chance of having another heart attack.</p><p>It's important to take your medicines exactly the way your doctor says. Let your doctor or nurse know if you have any side effects or problems with the medicines. You should also let him or her know if you can't afford your medicines. There are often ways to solve these problems.</p><p>Your doctor might also tell you to <strong>avoid</strong> certain medicines, like nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29400759\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to make lifestyle changes?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might. After a heart attack, your doctor or nurse will talk with you about:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quitting smoking, if you smoke &ndash; Quitting smoking can lower your chance of getting or dying from heart disease. To stop smoking, some people find it helpful to:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Use nicotine patches, gum, or nasal sprays instead of cigarettes &ndash; Nicotine is the main drug found in cigarettes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Work with a counselor to find ways to make it easier to quit</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Take a prescription medicine to reduce cigarette cravings</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting exercise &ndash; Getting regular exercise can keep your heart healthy. Your doctor or nurse will suggest an exercise program that is safe for you. Most doctors recommend that people exercise 30 to 60 minutes a day, 5 or more days of the week. In your exercise program, you should include 3 main types of exercise:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Aerobic exercise&quot; to raise your heart rate &ndash; Examples of aerobic exercise include walking, swimming, and jogging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Resistance training&quot; to make your muscles stronger &ndash; People can use weights or exercise bands to do these exercises.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stretching your muscles</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improving your diet &ndash; Eating the right foods can help keep you healthy. Fruits, vegetables, and foods with fiber can help prevent heart disease and strokes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79063\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79063 \">figure 1</a>). Try to avoid eating foods that can make heart disease worse. These include &quot;trans&quot; fats, which are found in many fast foods. If you are overweight, it's important to lose weight. Losing extra weight lowers your chance of having another heart attack.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29400766\"><span class=\"h1\">What is cardiac rehab?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Cardiac rehab&quot; is short for &quot;cardiac rehabilitation.&quot; It is a special type of care people receive after having a heart attack. In your cardiac rehab program, doctors, nurses, and other health professionals will teach you how to keep your heart healthy. This includes ways to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise safely</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improve your diet, stop smoking, and control your other health conditions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cope with feeling sad or worried after your heart attack</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29400773\"><span class=\"h1\">When can I have sex again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Having sex during the first 2 weeks after a heart attack might be more exercise than your doctor recommends. Check with your doctor about when it is safe to start having sex again. The timing will depend on the size of your heart attack, if you had problems after your heart attack, and if you still have symptoms.</p><p>After a heart attack, some people are less interested in sex or do not enjoy sex as much. This can be caused by certain heart medicines. It can also happen if people are worried about having a heart attack during sex. If you have problems with sex, let your doctor or nurse know. He or she might be able to treat those problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29400780\"><span class=\"h1\">When can I drive again and return to work?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Check with your doctor about when it is safe for you to drive again and return to work. Most people can drive again 1 week after their heart attack. Many people can return to work within 2 weeks of having a heart attack.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29400787\"><span class=\"h1\">What symptoms should I watch for?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After you have a heart attack, you should watch for chest pain or symptoms of another heart attack (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52579\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52579 \">figure 2</a>). People who have a heart attack have a higher than normal chance of having another heart attack and other heart problems.</p><p>If you think you might be having another heart attack, <strong>call for an ambulance right away (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>. Do not try to get to the hospital on your own.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29400655\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-after-a-heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines after a heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chest pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Exercise (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diet-and-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diet and health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High cholesterol (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary heart disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-can-go-wrong-after-a-heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What can go wrong after a heart attack?
