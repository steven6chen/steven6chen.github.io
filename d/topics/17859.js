This results in the &quot;sicca complex,&quot; a combination of dry eye (xerophthalmia) and dry mouth (xerostomia). A variety of other disease manifestations may also be present, including ocular or systemic extraglandular features.</p><p>The term &quot;keratoconjunctivitis sicca&quot; was coined by Henrik Sj&ouml;gren in 1933 to describe the ocular surface disease resulting from severe aqueous tear deficiency in a series of 19 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This term has been largely supplanted in the medical literature by &quot;dry eye.&quot;</p><p>SS occurs in a primary form not associated with other diseases and in a secondary form associated with other autoimmune rheumatic conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.</p><p>The treatment of moderate to severe dry eye in patients with SS will be reviewed here. General principles of therapy, initial treatment, and the approach to mild dry eye in patients with SS are discussed separately, as are other issues in SS including the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of SS, the treatment of dry mouth and other non-ocular sicca symptoms in patients with SS, and the treatment of extraglandular manifestations of SS.

Among these is multidisciplinary care, including collaboration with an eye care clinician. The aims of therapy for dry eye are twofold: to provide relief of symptoms, including dryness, burning, a sandy-gritty ocular irritation, pain, ocular fatigue, fluctuating or diminished vision, and pressure behind the eye; and to prevent damage to the eye due to ongoing inflammation of the ocular surface, such as corneal epithelial erosions, sterile keratitis with or without ulceration, and, eventually, neovascularization and scarring of the cornea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy#H3377142\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of dry eye in Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome: General principles and initial therapy&quot;, section on 'General principles'</a>.)</p><p>There are only a few large, well-designed, randomized trials that have evaluated the ability of specific treatments to improve dry eye signs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms in patients with SS. No studies have assessed the ability of any form of treatment to prevent ocular complications such as corneal melt or sterile ulcers. A 2011 systematic literature review summarized results of available published evidence with regard to treatment outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In 2016, a consensus panel provided recommendations for the evaluation and management of dry eye associated with SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Our general approach is based upon the available data from published studies as well as our clinical experience and is generally consistent with previous consensus recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. The choice of therapies depends upon the severity of the disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy#H3377156\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of dry eye in Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome: General principles and initial therapy&quot;, section on 'Initial therapy and mild disease'</a> and <a href=\"#H2046180389\" class=\"local\">'Moderate disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1850298031\" class=\"local\">'Severe disease'</a> below.)</p><p>The management of dry eye disease is typically staged, beginning with treatments that are low risk, readily accessible, and inexpensive; then proceeding to those that are more advanced if the patient's symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ocular signs do not improve with the simpler measures. Treatment decisions for dry eye are predicated not only on severity of symptoms and signs but also on whether or not there is an underlying ocular or systemic <span class=\"nowrap\">inflammatory/autoimmune</span> disease (eg, SS, graft-versus-host disease, sarcoidosis, atopy, rosacea) that is likely to be progressive. Successful management requires serial slit lamp examinations to assess ocular surface integrity and tear film stability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H411514473\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL THERAPY AND MILD DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial management in all patients should focus on symptomatic relief and prevention of ocular surface damage. Such treatment may be sufficient in patients with mild or only episodic discomfort and in those with only mild signs of local disease, such as mild ocular surface staining or mildly increased tear osmolarity. These strategies, which are generally applicable to patients with moderate and more severe disease as well, are described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy#H3377156\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of dry eye in Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome: General principles and initial therapy&quot;, section on 'Initial therapy and mild disease'</a>.)</p><p>Briefly, these include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient education regarding the disease and its complications, including counseling regarding home, workplace, and other environmental factors that may worsen symptoms; self-management techniques for tear conservation; and instruction regarding the signs and symptoms of blepharitis, which are distinct from those of aqueous tear deficiency and require daily eyelid hygiene measures for relief.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of prescription and nonprescription systemic medications that may cause or exacerbate symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

When present, they may include variable corneal staining, mild debris of tear film or decreased breakup time, or an abnormal Schirmer test, which is a test done to measure tear production.

The latter should be prescribed in collaboration with an ophthalmologist, as frequent measurement of intraocular pressure should be performed during this treatment. Topical steroids should only be used for short periods to avoid well-known complications such as cataracts and glaucoma.

However, among SS patients with moderately severe dry eye, this discordance in ocular and oral disease is very uncommon. Patients with dry mouth who use these medications sometimes experience symptomatic relief and decreased ocular dryness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].

Only a small amount (such as <span class=\"nowrap\">1/8</span> inch [2 to 3 mm]) should be used. Patients using lubricant ointments at night can clean their eyes using warm water and diluted baby shampoo (about 1 part in 300) in the morning to prevent blurred vision.

We recommend topical cyclosporine as the initial choice, given its long track record of safety and efficacy, and use it at the starting dose of twice daily for a period of three months before considering a dose increase in patients with persistent symptoms or signs (eg, persistent ocular surface staining). (See <a href=\"#H2700260282\" class=\"local\">'Topical cyclosporine'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients with moderate to severe dry eye, we often use a starting dose of four times daily and may supplement with a topical steroid drop (in collaboration with the patient's ophthalmologist) for several weeks to suppress the inflammation quickly and alleviate the ocular discomfort sometimes associated with the initial use of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>.</p><p>We switch to topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lifitegrast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lifitegrast</a> in patients on topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> who have persistence of symptoms or moderately severe ocular surface staining or who experience undue discomfort with its instillation (see <a href=\"#H2437314200\" class=\"local\">'Topical lifitegrast'</a> below). We typically treat patients with persistent symptoms or signs with topical cyclosporine in doses up to four times daily for a year before considering it a treatment failure. (See <a href=\"#H2700260282\" class=\"local\">'Topical cyclosporine'</a> below.)</p><p>Although there have been no head-to-head comparisons, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lifitegrast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lifitegrast</a> may provide more rapid relief of symptoms and less ocular irritation than topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>. However, long-term efficacy and safety have only been established for topical cyclosporine. Lifitegrast is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for individuals under the age of 18. The combined use of these two drugs has not been studied and thus cannot be advised.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2700260282\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical cyclosporine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> (0.05% ophthalmic emulsion in 0.4 mL vials) is administered as one drop twice daily and can be used together with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a>. However, the efficacy increases substantially with more frequent daily dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Use is contraindicated in patients with active ocular infections. Plasma cyclosporine levels are generally undetectable with the use of the 0.05% ophthalmic emulsion, even with eight times a day dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. A preservative-free multidose preparation of cyclosporine is also available for patients who have difficulty using the vials.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> drops can be prescribed by non-ophthalmic health care professionals because of the minimal risk of adverse effects. We generally try cyclosporine drops prior to tear duct occlusion, as this procedure is invariably associated with a transient decrease in aqueous tear secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Initial use of cyclosporine prior to tear duct occlusion might have an additional benefit of decreasing the local level of inflammatory mediators while avoiding risk of high local concentrations of such mediators and metalloproteinases that may result from occlusion without adequate antiinflammatory therapy. Although the initial phase III trials of topical cyclosporine did not show benefit in the subgroup of patients with punctal occlusion, the combination of both cyclosporine and punctal plugging may be of greater benefit than either treatment alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4113383405\" class=\"local\">'Punctal occlusion'</a> below.)</p><p>The benefits of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> for patients with Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome (SS) were shown in a series of randomized trials, which compared it with placebo and with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a>, and also in observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/10,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,15</a>]. Clinical benefits in both subjective and objective measures of dry eye and in changes in the corneal surface occur in about 60 to 75 percent of patients with twice-daily dosing, and treated patients show a decrease in infiltrating T cells in conjunctival biopsies and other improvements in histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/10,11,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,16-18</a>].

Accordingly, we typically treat patients with persistent symptoms or signs with topical cyclosporine in doses up to four times daily for a year before considering it a treatment failure.</p><p>Examples of evidence supporting the effectiveness and limited adverse effects of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 877 patients randomly assigned to receive twice-daily instillation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> (0.05 or 0.1%) or vehicle alone, there was improvement in objective measures (corneal staining and Schirmer testing) and subjective measures (blurred vision, need for concomitant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a>, and clinicians' global evaluation of response to treatment) at time points between three and six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. As examples, the mean improvements in blurred vision and in artificial tear use after six months were greater for the patients using cyclosporine 0.05% compared with those using the vehicle alone (reductions of approximately 0.5 versus 0.1 to 0.2 on a four-point scale, and reductions of nearly one-half versus one-tenth to one-fifth of a <span class=\"nowrap\">drop/day,</span> respectively). The clinician's subjective assessment of global response was improved in all groups at six months (slight response or better in 63 to 69 percent, and moderate response or better in 32 to 39 percent). There was no additional benefit of a higher dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The most common adverse effect was a mild to moderate, usually transient, burning sensation or stinging in the eyes after administration (18 percent of patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> [0.05% solution] versus 8 percent of controls); only 2 percent of patients in the cyclosporine or control groups discontinued treatment because of burning or stinging.

The response to cyclosporine 0.1% ophthalmic emulsion was examined during the extension (mean duration of treatment of 19.8 months). Most survey respondents reported that their symptoms had begun to resolve in the first three months of cyclosporine treatment. During the extension, further improvements in objective and subjective measures of dry eye disease were modest, presumably because of the prior treatment.

Alternatively, we may consider cauterization in patients who have failed topical therapies over the course of at least one year and in whom punctal plugs have provided benefit.</p><p>There is disagreement among experts regarding the type of punctal plug and the best timing for these procedures. Inflammation and local infection, such as blepharitis, should be controlled prior to performing these procedures to help avoid retention of proinflammatory tear components that could cause further injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10</a>].

We prefer silicone plugs, since they are hypoallergenic, durable, and easily removed if necessary. Temporary collagen punctal plugs are primarily used after corneal surgery to retain tears on the ocular surface for a self-limited period, such as refractive laser procedures. They often do not block the tear duct adequately and thus should not be used to judge whether occlusion of the tear ducts with permanent (eg, silicone) punctal plugs would be beneficial. Intracanalicular plugs are made of various different materials, including a hydrogel.</p><p>The effectiveness of punctal occlusion has been shown in small randomized trials, including a trial in which occlusion was performed unilaterally in a randomly chosen eye and compared with the contralateral eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], and in uncontrolled studies in which comparisons were made with baseline assessments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. In these reports and in our experience, a majority of patients describe improvement in symptoms and a decreased need for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a>, although less than 25 percent of patients have improvement in an objective measure of dryness or corneal surface injury. About 25 to 35 percent of plugs are extruded during follow-up requiring reinsertion. In a study of 19 SS patients who underwent partial lacrimal punctal occlusion of both eyes, there was improvement from baseline at 24 weeks and 24 months in Schirmer test values and ocular surface staining scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Complications of &quot;permanent&quot; (silicone) punctal plugs include local infections and pyogenic granuloma formation around the plugs; and plug extrusion or migration into the canaliculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. The potential risk for lacrimal sac infection (eg, dacryocystitis) is a concern but is low. Discomfort may occur with plug insertion. Another complication in some patients is epiphora due to inadequate drainage.</p><p>When indicated, laser or handheld thermal cautery can be used for a permanent closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Closing the punctum with a surgical suture is also an alternative. Permanent closure of the tear duct should only be done if one is confident that it will not result in epiphora. Punctal occlusion is a tear preservation strategy; as a result, it is of little benefit unless supplemented with artificial lubricants in those with minimal to no tear production.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1850298031\"><span class=\"h1\">SEVERE DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with frequent or constant symptoms should be managed initially using the measures described for mild and moderate disease, but they may not respond adequately to these approaches alone.

Topical lifitegrast is a reasonable alternative, particularly in patients with undue discomfort with instillation of cyclosporine. Topical cyclosporine (0.05% ophthalmic emulsion) is administered as one drop (0.4 mL) twice daily. Topical lifitegrast (5% ophthalmic solution) is administered as one drop (0.4 mL) twice daily.

Topical steroids may also be helpful as temporary adjunctive therapy early in the course of topical cyclosporine or lifitegrast to ease the side effects of burning or stinging. Topical steroids have potential risks and they should be administered under the direction and continued supervision of an ophthalmologist or an optometrist with monitoring of intraocular pressures. Treatment is usually of limited duration because of concern regarding adverse effects such as glaucoma and cataract formation.
