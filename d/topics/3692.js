The meninges consist of three parts: the pia, arachnoid, and dura maters. Bacterial meningitis reflects infection of the arachnoid mater and the CSF in both the subarachnoid space and the cerebral ventricles.</p><p>Approximately 1.2 million cases of bacterial meningitis occur annually worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Meningitis is among the 10 most common infectious causes of death and is responsible for approximately 135,000 deaths throughout the world each year. Neurologic sequelae are common among survivors.</p><p>The clinical and laboratory features of acute bacterial meningitis in adults will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, epidemiology, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of acute bacterial meningitis in adults and issues related to acute bacterial meningitis in children and to chronic and recurrent meningitis are discussed separately.

Healthcare-associated bacterial meningitis may also occur in patients with internal or external ventricular drains or following trauma (ie, cranial trauma or after basilar skull fracture with or without clinical evidence of leak of cerebrospinal fluid).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with bacterial meningitis are usually quite ill and often present soon after symptom onset. In a series of 301 adults, for example, the median duration of symptoms before admission was only 24 hours (range one hour to 14 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Presenting manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic triad of acute bacterial meningitis consists of fever, nuchal rigidity, and a change in mental status, although an appreciable number of patients do not have all three features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Most patients have high fevers, often greater than 38&ordm;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], but a small percentage have hypothermia. Almost no patients have a normal temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Headache is also common. The headache is typically described as severe and generalized. It is not easily confused with a normal headache.</p><p>The following findings at presentation and during hospitalization were noted in a review of 279 episodes of community-acquired meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The frequency of headache was not noted.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever was present in 95 percent at presentation and developed in another 4 percent within the first 24 hours. Among survivors in whom such data were available, 19 percent had fever for 10 or more consecutive days, but most had other possible causes of continued fever. Patients with no identifiable source of fever other than meningitis had an average of four consecutive days of fever (range 0 to 14 days).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nuchal rigidity was present in 88 percent on initial examination and persisted for more than seven days in some patients despite overall improvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mental status was altered in 78 percent. Most were confused or lethargic, but 22 percent were responsive only to pain and 6 percent were unresponsive to all stimuli.</p><p/><p>Similar findings were noted in three other large series of adults with acute bacterial meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>]. At presentation, fever was present in 77 to 85 percent, neck stiffness in 83 to 94 percent, headache in 79 to 94 percent, and altered mental status in 83 percent, including coma in 14 to 16 percent.</p><p>One or more of the classic findings on history (fever, neck stiffness, altered mental status) or physical examination (nuchal rigidity) are absent in many patients with bacterial meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/2,3,5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,5,7</a>]. In a 2004 prospective study of 696 cases of community-acquired bacterial meningitis, only 44 percent had the clinical triad of fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], although almost all patients (95 percent) presented with at least two of four symptoms (ie, headache, fever, stiff neck, and altered mental status). The classic triad was much more likely to occur in patients with pneumococcal compared with meningococcal meningitis (58 versus 27 percent). It must be noted that older adults (especially those with underlying conditions such as diabetes mellitus or cardiopulmonary disease) may present insidiously with lethargy or obtundation, no fever, and variable signs of meningeal inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>However, virtually all patients have at least one of the findings of the classic triad of fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status (sensitivity 99 to 100 percent for the presence of at least one finding in a 1999 critical appraisal of 10 studies of 845 episodes of meningitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Similarly, 99 percent had at least one classic feature in the 2004 series of 696 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, the absence of all of these findings essentially excludes the presence of bacterial meningitis.</p><p>In addition to the classic findings, a number of other manifestations, both neurologic and nonneurologic, can occur in patients with bacterial meningitis, and some findings may be suggestive of a particular bacterial etiology:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic complications such as seizures, focal neurologic deficits (including cranial nerve palsies), and papilledema may be present early or occur later in the course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/3-5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,9</a>]. In an observational study of 696 patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis, cerebral infarction occurred in 25 percent of episodes and in 36 percent of patients with pneumococcal meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Seizures have been described in 15 to 30 percent of patients and focal neurologic deficits in 10 to 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/2-4,9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,9,11</a>]. Hearing loss is a late complication. Papilledema is observed in &lt;5 percent of patients at the time of initial presentation. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dexamethasone</a> therapy may reduce the rate of neurologic sequelae, particularly in selected patients with pneumococcal meningitis of intermediate severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-to-prevent-neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dexamethasone to prevent neurologic complications of bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with <em>Listeria</em> meningitis have an increased tendency to have seizures and focal neurologic deficits early in the course of infection, and some patients may present with a syndrome of rhombencephalitis (manifested as ataxia, cranial nerve palsies, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nystagmus). In a review of 367 episodes of central nervous system infections caused by <em>L. monocytogenes</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], the most common findings were fever (92 percent of patients) and altered sensorium (65 percent of patients). In a prospective study of 30 adults with <em>Listeria</em> meningitis, 43 percent of patients had the triad of fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status; only 37 percent of patients had focal neurologic deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Listeria monocytogenes infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain bacteria, particularly <em>N. meningitidis</em>, can cause characteristic skin manifestations, such as petechiae and palpable purpura. In two large series of patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis, rash was present in 11 and 26 percent; among those with rash, 75 and 92 percent were associated with meningococcal meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In another study of 258 adults with meningococcal meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], rash was present in 64 percent and characterized as petechial in 91 percent of patients. However, others have observed a rash in &le;26 percent of cases of meningococcal meningitis and, if present, the rash was more likely to be scanty or more atypical appearing than the rash seen in patients with meningococcal septicemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A petechial rash is not specific for meningococcal infection, and some patients with meningococcal meningitis have a maculopapular rash [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of meningococcal infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthritis occurs in some patients with bacterial meningitis. In a case series of 696 episodes of community-acquired bacterial meningitis, arthritis was diagnosed in 48 (7 percent) of the episodes, with <em>N. meningitidis</em> the etiologic agent in two-thirds of these joint infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Joint fluid aspiration was performed in 23 patients and was positive by culture in six (26 percent). Recognition of the concurrent arthritis is important since prolonged antibiotic therapy is necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=septic-arthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Septic arthritis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacterial meningitis tends to spare other organs unless severe sepsis ensues. However, if meningitis is the sequela of an infection elsewhere in the body, there may be features of that infection still present at the time of diagnosis of meningitis (eg, otitis or sinusitis).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Examination for nuchal rigidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although patients may not complain specifically of a stiff neck, it is easy to demonstrate nuchal rigidity. Passive or active flexion of the neck will usually result in an inability to touch the chin to the chest. Difficulty in lateral motion of the neck is a less reliable finding.</p><p>Tests to illustrate meningismus (such as Kernig and Brudzinski signs) were originally developed and tested in patients with severe, late stage meningitis (such as that caused by tuberculosis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82677\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82677 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic Brudzinski sign refers to spontaneous flexion of the hips during attempted passive flexion of the neck.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Kernig sign refers to the inability or reluctance to allow full extension of the knee when the hip is flexed 90 degrees. The Kernig test is usually performed in the supine position, but it can be tested in the seated patient.</p><p/><p>Although nuchal rigidity and Kernig and Brudzinski signs were described over a century ago, their accuracy was not assessed in a large, well-designed prospective study until a 2002 report of 297 patients with suspected meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Suspected meningitis was defined as the presence of clinical symptoms (eg, fever, headache, stiff neck, photophobia, nausea, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting) that led to performance of a lumbar puncture to exclude meningeal inflammation.</p><p>When meningitis was defined as &ge;6 white <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the sensitivity was extremely low (5 percent for each sign and 30 percent for nuchal rigidity); the specificity was 95 percent for each sign and 68 percent for nuchal rigidity. Neither Kernig nor Brudzinski signs performed much better among the 29 patients with moderate meningeal inflammation or the four patients with severe meningeal inflammation, defined as &ge;100 and &ge;1000 white <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> respectively. Nuchal rigidity was present in all four patients with severe meningeal inflammation but had a specificity of only 70 percent.</p><p>Jolt accentuation of headache may be a more sensitive maneuver for the diagnosis of meningitis. A positive test consists of accentuation of headache by horizontal rotation of the head at a frequency of two to three times per second. The diagnostic value of this maneuver was evaluated in a study of 34 patients presenting to an outpatient clinic or emergency department with headache and fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]; jolt accentuation of headache had a sensitivity of 97 percent and a specificity of 60 percent for the diagnosis of CSF pleocytosis. However, more recent studies have shown conflicting results. In one study of 230 patients who had CSF analysis, 47 had pleocytosis and 197 had headache, making them eligible for jolt accentuation testing; the sensitivity of jolt accentuation was only 21 percent and the specificity was 82 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], indicating the jolt accentuation was poorly predictive in patients with CSF pleocytosis. In another study of 531 adult patients, 139 of whom had meningitis, the sensitivity and specificity of jolt accentuation were 64 percent and 43 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], indicating that the absence of jolt accentuation of headache cannot exclude the possibility of meningitis in adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determinants of the pace of bacterial meningitis are related to both host and microbial virulence factors. Any form of bacterial meningitis that is untreated or treated very late in its course is almost uniformly fatal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacterial meningitis is associated with appreciable mortality and risk of late sequelae in survivors. These issues are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial therapy and prognosis of bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Mortality'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic complications of bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Baseline features can be used to estimate the individual patient's risk for an adverse outcome. A prognostic model was derived from a cohort of 176 adults and then validated in another cohort of 93 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The in-hospital mortality was 27 percent, and 9 percent had a neurologic deficit at discharge. Three baseline clinical features (hypotension, altered mental status, and seizures) were independently associated with an adverse outcome (defined as in-hospital death or neurologic deficit at discharge) and stratified the patients into three risk groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low risk (no clinical risk factors) &ndash; 9 percent adverse outcome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermediate risk (one clinical risk factor) &ndash; 33 percent adverse outcome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High risk (two or three risk factors) &ndash; 56 percent adverse outcome</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2895219066\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pretreatment evaluation for presumed bacterial meningitis is discussed in detail separately.

The white blood cell count is usually elevated, with a shift toward immature forms; however, severe infection can be associated with leukopenia. The platelet count may also be reduced. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia have correlated with a poor outcome in patients with bacterial meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Coagulation studies may be consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation. Results of serum chemistry tests are usually commensurate with the severity of the overall process and may reveal an anion gap metabolic acidosis or hyponatremia; in one series, hyponatremia was present in 30 percent of patients but was usually mild and did not require specific treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood cultures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood cultures are often positive and can be useful in the event that cerebrospinal fluid cannot be obtained before the administration of antimicrobials.

Those who underwent immediate LP without CT received antibiotics 1.6 hours earlier than those who underwent CT prior to LP.

(See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Blood cultures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two sets of blood cultures should be obtained from all patients prior to the initiation of antimicrobial therapy.

(See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Relative contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is not uncommon for LP to be delayed while a computed tomographic (CT) scan is performed to exclude a mass lesion or increased intracranial pressure, which rarely leads to cerebral herniation during subsequent CSF removal. However, a screening CT scan is not necessary in the majority of patients. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Indications for CT scan before LP'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CT scan of the head before LP should be performed in adult patients with suspected bacterial meningitis who have one or more of the following risk factors:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Immunocompromised state (eg, HIV infection, immunosuppressive therapy, solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>History of central nervous system disease (mass lesion, stroke, or focal infection)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>New onset seizure (within one week of presentation)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Papilledema</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abnormal level of consciousness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Focal neurologic deficit (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Indications for CT scan before LP'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If LP is delayed or deferred, blood cultures should be obtained and antimicrobial therapy should be administered empirically before the imaging study, followed as soon as possible by the LP. In addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenously every six hours) should be given shortly before or at the same time as the antimicrobial agents if the preponderance of clinical and laboratory evidence suggests bacterial meningitis with a plan to stop therapy, if indicated, when the evaluation is complete. Adjunctive dexamethasone should not be given to patients who have already received antimicrobial therapy because it is unlikely to improve patient outcome. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'If LP is delayed'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The usual CSF findings in patients with bacterial meningitis are a white blood cell count of 1000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">5000/microL</span> (range of &lt;100 to &gt;10,000) with a percentage of neutrophils usually greater than 80 percent, protein of 100 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> and glucose &lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (with a CSF:serum glucose ratio of &le;0.4). Despite these typical CSF findings, the spectrum of CSF values in bacterial meningitis is so wide that the absence of one or more of the typical findings is of little value (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76324\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76324 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When clinical findings strongly suggest meningitis, CSF analysis including Gram stain and culture will help differentiate between bacterial and viral infection if the Gram stain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> culture is positive.
