It is caused by a virus called &quot;human parvovirus B19.&quot; Another name for erythema infectiosum is &quot;fifth disease.&quot;</p><p>Fifth disease is common in children. Adults can also get it. If a pregnant woman gets fifth disease, it can be dangerous for her unborn baby, but this is rare. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18905277\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of fifth disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with fifth disease have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. Most people feel better in a few weeks.</p><p>When symptoms do occur, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sore throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itching</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upset stomach &ndash; With diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sneezing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conjunctivitis (also called &quot;pinkeye&quot;) &ndash; This is an eye infection or irritation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle aches</p><p/><p>These first symptoms last 2 to 5 days. After that, symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rash on the face &ndash; Often called a &quot;slapped cheek&quot; rash, this rash makes a child's cheek looks bright red, as if someone just slapped it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83120\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83120 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rash on the chest, back, arms, and legs &ndash; This usually shows up after the face rash. The rash makes a pattern that looks like lace (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83122\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83122 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint pain &ndash; Usually in hands, wrists, knees, and feet. These are more common in adults who get fifth disease. Children do not get them as often.</p><p/><p>Children often feel better by the time they get a rash. Sometimes, the rash comes back after it goes away. Sunlight, temperature changes, exercise, or stress can make it come back.</p><p>People with certain medical conditions can get sicker with fifth disease than other people. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who have problems with the body&rsquo;s infection-fighting system, called the &ldquo;immune system.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who have certain conditions that affect red blood cells, such as sickle cell disease or thalassemia. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18905292\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for fifth disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A doctor or nurse can usually tell if someone has it by learning about the symptoms and doing an exam. If there is any doubt, he or she can order a blood test for the virus that causes fifth disease.</p><p>If you are pregnant and have symptoms of fifth disease, or are around someone who has it, tell your doctor or nurse right away. He or she can order a blood test to see if you have the infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18905307\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child has an immune or blood disorder and has symptoms of fifth disease, see the doctor or nurse.</p><p>If you or your child has symptoms for more than a month, see your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18905324\"><span class=\"h1\">How is fifth disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with fifth disease get better without treatment. If your child has itching or joint pain, the doctor or nurse might recommend medicine to help your child feel better. For example, the doctor might recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) to treat pain.</p><p>So far, doctors do not have a good medicine to treat the virus that causes fifth disease. Antibiotics <strong>do not work</strong> on fifth disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18905338\"><span class=\"h1\">Can fifth disease be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can lower your chances of getting fifth disease by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Washing your hands often with soap and water, or using an alcohol hand rub. Teach your children to do the same.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not sharing food and drinks with other people.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18905353\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are pregnant and were around someone with the virus that causes fifth disease, ask your doctor or nurse about your risk of infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18905368\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=avoiding-infections-in-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Avoiding infections in pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fever in children (The Basics)</a> </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=avoiding-infections-in-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Avoiding infections in pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
