These syndromes may affect any part of the nervous system, from cerebral cortex to neuromuscular junction and muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50304 \">table 1</a>), either damaging one area (eg, Purkinje cell, presynaptic cholinergic synapses) or multiple areas (eg, encephalomyelitis).</p><p>This topic provides an overview of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of paraneoplastic disorders. Individual syndromes are discussed separately.

The immunologic response is directed against shared antigens that are ectopically expressed by the tumor, but otherwise exclusively expressed by the nervous system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56327\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56327 \">picture 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], or rarely by the nervous system and testes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. For unknown reasons, the immune system identifies these antigens as foreign and mounts an immune attack against them. One report suggests that the immune system can mount a T-cell response to a normal protein when it is expressed in a cancer cell, suggesting that normal self-antigens may be processed differently in cancer cells than in the normal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Antibodies that occur in paraneoplastic disorders have been divided in two categories depending on the location of the antigen.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies directed against intracellular neuronal proteins (called classical paraneoplastic or onconeuronal antibodies) &ndash; These antibodies belong to the category of &quot;well-characterized&quot; paraneoplastic antibodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77919 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F111054\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111054 \">table 3</a>), and their detection almost always indicates the presence of an underlying tumor. Examples include Hu (also known as type 1 anti-neuronal nuclear antibody [ANNA-1]), Ri (also known as type 2 anti-neuronal nuclear antibody [ANNA-2]), Yo (also known as Purkinje cell cytoplasmic antibody type 1 [PCA-1]), amphiphysin, Ma2, Tr (also known as <span class=\"nowrap\">delta/notch-like</span> epidermal growth factor-related receptor [DNER]), collapsin response-mediator protein-5 (CRMP-5), and recoverin. These antibodies are surrogate markers of the paraneoplastic disorder, but in most of these disorders, the pathogenic mechanism is believed to be mediated by cytotoxic T-cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies directed against neuronal cell surface or synaptic proteins &ndash; Examples include antibodies against the anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77919 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F111054\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111054 \">table 3</a>). These antibodies may occur with or without a cancer or tumor association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The frequency of a tumor association varies according to the antibody. These antibodies appear to have direct pathogenic effects on the target antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>To date, antibodies with a direct pathogenic effect on the target neuromuscular or neuronal antigens have only been found in a few disorders of the peripheral nerve or neuromuscular junction and in a substantial number of autoimmune encephalitides with antibodies against cell surface or synaptic proteins. Detection of these antibodies does not necessarily imply the presence of an underlying tumor, given that they can also occur in the nonparaneoplastic setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

In keeping with this hypothesis, some reports suggest a more limited disease distribution and better outcome among patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) who develop immunity to paraneoplastic antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. However, review of most large series of patients demonstrates that the oncologic outcome of patients with antibody-associated paraneoplastic syndromes does not significantly differ from that of patients who do not have the antibodies or a paraneoplastic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system/abstract/28-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-33</a>].</p><p>Cell-mediated immunity also appears to play an important role in paraneoplastic neurologic disorders. T-cell responses directed against the same tumor antigens can be demonstrated in some patients, although the relative contribution of cellular and humoral immunity to the clinical and pathologic manifestations is an unresolved issue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].</p><p>This topic review will focus on those neurologic syndromes that are associated with paraneoplastic antibodies.

One or more paraneoplastic neurologic disorder is present in up to 9 percent of patients with SCLC (mostly LEMS, sensory neuronopathy, and limbic encephalitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]; for most other solid tumors, the incidence is far less than 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Paraneoplastic peripheral neuropathies affect 5 to 15 percent of patients with plasma cell dyscrasias associated with malignant monoclonal gammopathies. More than 50 percent of patients with the rare osteosclerotic form of myeloma develop a predominantly motor paraneoplastic peripheral neuropathy. Patients with all forms of myeloma, but usually the osteosclerotic type, can develop a severe, symmetric, sensorimotor neuropathy with muscle atrophy in association with the POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, and skin).

Since the development of both disorders is highly disabling, and LEMS usually responds to treatment, all patients with SCLC who develop paraneoplastic cerebellar symptoms should be examined for LEMS. In almost all patients with LEMS, lower extremity reflexes are absent; sometimes they reappear after exercise. Another association is the development of LEMS in about 6 percent of patients with anti-Hu associated paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Nevertheless, electrophysiologic findings that confirm the underlying syndrome may still be helpful by directing the search for the neoplasm to specific organs (eg, lung with LEMS, and thymus with MG).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Occult malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While paraneoplastic syndromes are most often diagnosed in the setting of a known malignancy, it is common for a paraneoplastic disorder to develop before a cancer is identified.</p><p>The clinical syndrome and identification of certain paraneoplastic antibodies may suggest a specific underlying tumor and direct investigations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77919 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F111054\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111054 \">table 3</a>). In most other instances, the tumor is revealed by computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Additional tests, such as mammogram, breast MRI, or ultrasound of the pelvis or testes, are ordered when suggested by the clinical syndrome and identification of certain paraneoplastic antibodies or the presence of other risk factors.</p><p>Whole body FDG-PET combined with CT is useful in demonstrating occult neoplasms or small metastatic lesions and is a reasonable alternative to sequential testing starting with CT and mammography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>].

Results from another small study found that FDG-PET combined with CT scanning increased sensitivity and accuracy of tumor diagnosis in patients with paraneoplastic syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>A negative <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scan does not rule out underlying cancer; use of other imaging modalities (eg, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound) or repeating <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scan after a several-month interval can be fruitful. A 2010 taskforce recommended repeat cancer screening in three to six months after an initial negative evaluation, followed by screening every six months up until four years, if testing remains unrevealing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

The likelihood of response varies by syndrome; additional predictors of response are not well understood.</p><p>In general, in the paraneoplastic disorders with antibodies against intracellular antigens (classical paraneoplastic or onconeuronal antibodies), in which the underlying pathogenic mechanism is thought to be cytotoxic T-cell mediated, the response to treatment (antitumor plus immunotherapy) is less satisfactory than in those disorders associated with antibodies against cell surface or synaptic proteins, in which the pathogenic mechanism is antibody-mediated. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syndromes likely to respond to treatment &ndash; Immunosuppression is beneficial for some conditions, such as the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) and myasthenia gravis (MG). In these conditions, plasma exchange or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) (eg, 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> daily for five days) is usually effective in suppressing the immune response and improving neurologic status, at least in the short term.

These disorders are usually treated with first line immunotherapeutics (steroids, IVIG or plasma exchange), and if these fail, second line therapies such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> are often effective.

For peripheral neuropathies, and particularly those with predominant demyelinating features, plasmapheresis, IVIG, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> can be effective.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In cancer-associated disorders that are probably antibody-mediated, such as opsoclonus myoclonus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>], stiff-person syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>], and dermatomyositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>], the approach to treatment is usually similar to that used for syndromes associated with antibodies against cell surface antigens.

In these patients, the treatment approach of removing the antibodies from serum (eg, plasma exchange, IVIG) usually fails; immunotherapies addressing T-cell mechanisms should be considered early (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, which decreases B-cell antigen presentation to T-cells) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

The failure of the neurologic syndrome to respond to treatment may be due to irreversible neuronal damage that occurred before the diagnosis was made and treatment begun. Rare patients may develop a second paraneoplastic syndrome, after recovering or stabilizing from the first. In one case series of eight such patients, the second paraneoplastic syndrome revealed cancer relapse in five and a second cancer in one patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes are a heterogeneous group of disorders caused by mechanisms other than metastases, metabolic and nutritional deficits, infections, coagulopathy, or side effects of cancer treatment. These syndromes may affect any part of the nervous system from cerebral cortex to neuromuscular junction and muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50304 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes are believed to result when an immunologic response is directed against shared antigens that are ectopically expressed by the tumor, but otherwise predominantly expressed by the nervous system.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients suspected of having a paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome should be examined for paraneoplastic antibodies. Testing of serum alone may suffice for &quot;well-characterized&quot; or &quot;classical&quot; paraneoplastic antibodies, but is not sufficient for some autoimmune encephalitides associated with antibodies against cell surface or synaptic proteins. When these disorders are suspected, CSF should be examined (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77919 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F111054\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111054 \">table 3</a>). Important caveats include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Low levels of some paraneoplastic antibodies may be seen in the serum of cancer patients without paraneoplastic syndromes. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Well-characterized paraneoplastic antibodies rarely, if ever, occur in normal individuals. The presence of such antibodies should demand a careful search for an underlying neoplasm. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Some, but not all, paraneoplastic antibodies may be associated with different neurologic syndromes and the same neurologic syndrome may be associated with different paraneoplastic antibodies.
