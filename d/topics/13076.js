At one extreme are the kinds of obesity caused by single-gene mutations. At the other extreme are the kinds of obesity caused by various diseases (such as damage to the ventromedial hypothalamus) in subjects in whom obesity would otherwise not occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the types of obesity caused by single-gene defects, the genetic susceptibility to obesity, and the pathogenetic mechanisms that operate within this genetic framework to cause differences in total body fat content and in regional fat distribution.</p><p>Other risk factors associated with the development of obesity, such as diet, lifestyle, drugs, and endocrine disorders, are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-etiology-and-natural-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Etiology and natural history&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H930467506\"><span class=\"h1\">HERITABLE FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies of twins, adoptees, and families all suggest the existence of genetic factors in humans with obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The heritability of obesity estimated from twin studies is high, ranging from 60 to 90 percent, with only slightly lower values in twins raised apart compared with those raised together. Similarly, in adoptees, the body mass index (BMI) correlates with that of their biologic parents rather than that of their adoptive parents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1161052685\"><span class=\"h2\">Common obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obesity is a heritable trait, but the genes that contribute to the more common forms of obesity have been a challenge to identify. A combined meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (n = 82) and Metabochip studies (n = 43) in nearly 340,000 individuals identified 97 loci associated with BMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These loci accounted for approximately 2.7 percent of the variation in BMI, and the authors estimated that as much as 21 percent of BMI variation can be accounted for by common genetic variation.</p><p>Moreover, 49 genetic loci have been associated with waist-to-hip ratios adjusted for BMI and show sexual dimorphism among these genes, which are often expressed in adipose tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The relationship of BMI with the number of genes is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F87759\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87759 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/9-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-16</a>].</p><p>Environmental factors appear to modify the known genetic associations with BMI. In an observational study of 8788 adults aged 50 years or older (born between 1900 and 1958), the magnitude of association between BMI and a polygenic risk score (a weighted sum of alleles of 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms) was higher in recent birth cohorts compared with earlier birth cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The difference was thought to be related to exposure to the &quot;obesogenic&quot; environment (lifestyle changes that developed in the late 1970s, including increased food and sugar-sweetened beverage intake and a decrease in physical activity). More recent cohorts were exposed to this environment beginning early in life, while earlier birth cohorts were not exposed until late in life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2058738121\"><span class=\"h2\">Fat mass and obesity (FTO) variants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among the genes identified by GWAS, the <em>FTO</em> gene on chromosome 16 (fat mass and obesity associated) has the strongest genetic association with obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/10,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18</a>]. A variant in this gene predisposes to type 2 diabetes through an effect on BMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, two studies suggest that this variant also affects the risk of obesity in the general population. In one, 16 percent of adults in 13 European cohorts were homozygous for the risk allele and weighed, on average, 3 kg more than those without the risk allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Both studies found an approximate 1.5-fold increase in the risk in obesity with the inherited risk genotype, which was seen in both children and adults. Several reports suggest that the at-risk <em>FTO</em> haplotype accounts may account for up to 15 to 20 percent of common obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/10,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18,19</a>].</p><p>The mechanisms of the association between <em>FTO</em> variants and obesity have been unclear. However, a noncoding causal variant in <em>FTO</em> has now been identified that changes the function of adipocytes from energy utilization (beige fat) to energy storage (white fat) and a fivefold decrease in mitochondrial thermogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. When the effect of the variant was blocked in genetically engineered mice, thermogenesis increased and weight gain did not occur, despite eating a high-fat diet. Blocking the gene's effect in human adipocytes also increased energy utilization. This observation has important implications for potential new anti-obesity drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3994812260\"><span class=\"h1\">SINGLE-GENE DEFECTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3331310712\"><span class=\"h2\">Prader-Willi syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Prader-Willi syndrome is a neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by genetic abnormalities of the long arm of chromosome 15 (q11-13). The majority of patients have a deletion of paternal DNA in this region; most of the remainder have two copies of maternal chromosome 15 (uniparental disomy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The key genetic material usually lacking is the <em>SNRPN </em>gene, which codes for a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein thought to be involved in imprinting genes from both parents. The deletions can often be detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization; molecular analysis of the <em>SNRPN</em> gene can be done if a deletion is not detected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and genetics of Prader-Willi syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-genetic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of genetic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Affected infants have poor muscle tone and feed poorly at birth. Later, their appetite becomes voracious and they become obese, have behavior problems (irritability, tantrums), delayed development, short stature, and later, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Most boys have cryptorchidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Little information is available about adult patients with Prader-Willi (given their small numbers). However, in one report of 32 girls over age 15 years, primary amenorrhea was seen in 18 of 32 cases (56 percent), while 14 of 32 (44 percent) had spontaneous menarche (usually followed by irregular menses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This raises the question of the need for contraception in some adult patients with Prader-Willi syndrome.

There is no effective treatment for most of the problems, although administration of GH accelerates growth and decreases body fat.

Disordered function of the primary cilia may be a fundamental defect in this syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2738047776\"><span class=\"h2\">Leptin gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ob or Lep gene codes for a protein called leptin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Leptin-deficient mice (ob mice) have hyperphagia, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and infertility. Administration of leptin to these mice reverses all the features of this syndrome, indicating that it is the missing signal.</p><p>Leptin is produced in fat cells, the placenta, and, to a lesser degree, in the gut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. It signals the brain about the quantity of stored fat. This and other observations have led to the suggestion that, with increasing adiposity, resistance to the action of leptin occurs, blunting the negative feedback &quot;adipostatic&quot; signal to brain centers to reduce energy intake. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-leptin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of leptin&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Obesity due to leptin deficiency has been found primarily in consanguineous families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, most people with obesity do not have any abnormalities in the leptin gene, their serum leptin concentrations are high reflecting their increased fat mass, and in preliminary studies, administration of supraphysiological doses of leptin resulted in only minimal weight loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-leptin#H1956595964\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of leptin&quot;, section on 'Obesity'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-leptin#H3855746235\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of leptin&quot;, section on 'Leptin and disease'</a>.)</p><p>The aggregate of findings suggest that the primary role of leptin is to indicate whether somatic fat stores are sufficient for growth and reproduction. Inadequate stores would be signaled by a decline in serum leptin concentrations below a threshold that may be genetically or developmentally set; the result is hyperphagia, low energy output, and infertility. In contrast, a serum leptin concentration above this threshold may have little or no physiologic effect, resulting in neither hypophagia nor hypermetabolism.

A systematic review from the Human Genome Epidemiology (HuGE) project showed convincingly that the three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs rs6232, rs6234, and rs6235) in <em>PCSK1</em> are associated with obesity in Caucasians but not in Asians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3638439266\"><span class=\"h2\">Melanocortin-4 receptor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital deficiency of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) is associated with early-onset obesity and taller-than-average height. Evidence from one patient with a homozygous mutation in the receptor suggests that MC4R mediates most of the anorectic effects of leptin in early childhood but not the effect of leptin on linear growth and other endocrine axes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-leptin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of leptin&quot;</a>). In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 16,000 individuals (and confirmed in additional populations), common variants near the MC4R were associated with increasing body mass index (BMI) in both children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Heterozygous mutations in this gene are reported to be the most common monogenic cause of severe obesity in childhood in some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/30,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1348135128\"><span class=\"h2\">Proopiomelanocortin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) transmits the anorexic effect of leptin through the MC4R (see <a href=\"#H3638439266\" class=\"local\">'Melanocortin-4 receptor'</a> above). Individuals with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the proopiomelanocortin (<em>POMC</em>) gene present with adrenal crisis in neonatal life due to corticotropin (ACTH) deficiency. ACTH is produced from POMC in the hypothalamus, as is alpha-MSH, an important factor for reducing food intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Therefore, patients with these POMC mutations also have early-onset obesity due to severe hyperphagia. Selective melanocortin receptor agonists have been tested in two patients with POMC deficiency with some success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349762897\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional genes can also play a significant role in the development of obesity. Two of these are brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its tyrosine kinase receptor tropomyocin-related kinase B (TrkB). Children with mutations have severe hyperphagia and obesity, impaired short-term memory, hyperactivity, and learning disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Patients with Wilms tumor-aniridia syndrome (WAGR) have a subset of deletions on chromosome 11p.12, encompassing the BDNF locus. These patients also have early-onset obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The second gene is single-minded 1 (<em>SIM1</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]; patients deficient in SIM1 are hyperphagic with evidence of autonomic dysfunction, which is also seen in MC4R deficiency, suggesting that some aspects of the clinical phenotype can be explained by altered melanocortin signalling. Carriers of the <em>SIM1</em> mutation may have speech and language delay and exhibit neurobehavioral abnormalities including autistic types of behavior. These features can be seen in Prader-Willi syndrome but are not recognized features of MC4R deficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2993585007\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF OBESITY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2667115826\"><span class=\"h2\">Adaptation to weight loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An increase in body fat (both visceral and nonvisceral [subcutaneous]) requires that energy intake be higher than energy expenditure. Nevertheless, precise estimation of each is more complex than previously thought. For example, intrauterine, environmental, and genetic exposures can differentially impact both handling and storage of dietary calories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Poor adaptation to weight loss, which may contribute to weight regain, has been shown in several studies. In one study of 18 obese and 23 never-obese subjects who were monitored during caloric restriction and caloric excess, weight loss of 10 to 20 percent was associated with a decrease in total and resting energy expenditure, a change that retarded further weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Similarly, weight gain was associated with an increase in energy expenditure, which retarded further weight gain. These observations suggest a mechanism that tends to maintain body weight and lends support to the theory that behavior is not the sole determinant of obesity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Behavioral therapy&quot;, section on 'Maintenance of weight loss'</a>.)</p><p>In another study, individuals were put on a very low-calorie diet for 10 weeks and then followed throughout the remainder of the year, during which time a variety of measures were taken [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Hunger ratings initially fell but rebounded after the very low-calorie diet. The gastrointestinal peptide ghrelin, which stimulates appetite, increased after diet-induced weight loss. Other circulating mediators that inhibit intake (eg, leptin, peptide YY, cholecystokinin, pancreatic polypeptide) decreased. These hormonal adaptations favoring weight gain persisted for at least one year after diet-induced weight loss.</p><p>One consequence of these changes in energy expenditure is that a formerly obese subject would require 15 percent fewer calories to maintain a &quot;normal&quot; body weight than someone with the same body composition who was never obese. The reductions in energy expenditure persist, even in adults who have maintained a reduced body weight for three to five years. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4154453427\"><span class=\"h2\">Microbiome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The microbiome in the gut can influence the calories the body absorbs. Body weight is affected by the calories that are absorbed, not calories ingested. Human enzymes convert starches into simple sugars (which are absorbed easily), but human enzymes are unable to digest many dietary polysaccharides. However, microbial enzymes can turn those polysaccharides into digestible sources of energy. While the composition of gut microbiota can influence obesity, it appears that obesity can influence the composition of gut microbiota [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. For example, when obese people lose weight, the proportion of microbiota changes (<em>Bacteroidetes</em> increases relative to <em>Firmicutes</em>). Conversely, when obese people resume their previous diets and gain weight, the proportion of <em>Firmicutes</em> increases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H721561818\"><span class=\"h2\">Determinants of energy expenditure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low energy expenditure is one factor that can promote weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Approximately 70 percent of energy expenditure is utilized for basal or resting metabolic processes. These include the energy involved in maintaining body temperature and ion gradients across cell membranes, cardiac and respiratory muscle function, gastrointestinal motility and secretion, and other metabolic storage and mobilization processes. Another 10 percent of energy expenditure is dissipated through the thermic responses to food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The final component of energy expenditure is activity and exercise.</p><p>There is a strong relationship between total daily energy expenditure as well as resting energy expenditure and fat-free mass.

Through a process called adaptive thermogenesis, uncoupling protein 1 (<em>UCP1</em>), a marker gene for BAT, allows mitochondria to generate heat instead of ATP, thereby maintaining normal body temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>BAT activity increases through childhood into adolescence, peaking at approximately 13 years of age in both boys and girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Thereafter, the amount of BAT decreases with age, and BAT was previously thought not to play a role in adult thermogenesis. However, observational studies using positron emission <span class=\"nowrap\">tomography/computed</span> tomography (PET-CT) scanning have demonstrated the presence of metabolically active brown adipose tissue in adults, particularly in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. Colder temperatures enhance 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake by BAT, allowing visualization on PET-CT, which was not seen in a warm climate.</p><p>BAT is predominantly located in the supraclavicular and neck areas, and BAT activity is inversely related to body mass index (BMI) and percent body fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Thus, activation of BAT may be an important component of cold-stimulated energy expenditure in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2685306926\"><span class=\"h3\">Food</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The macronutrient composition of food affects energy expenditure but not fat storage. In a randomized trial designed to determine whether the level of dietary protein affects body composition, weight gain, and energy expenditure, 28 individuals were randomly assigned to overfeeding with diets containing 5, 15, or 25 percent of energy from protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Overconsumption of a diet with normal (15 percent of energy) or high (25 percent) compared with low (5 percent) protein increased resting energy expenditure and lean body mass. Although overall weight gain was less with a low-protein diet (approximately 3 versus 6 kg), body fat accumulation was similar and was related to excess calories consumed rather than the protein composition of the diet.</p><p>The thermic effect of food has an obligatory and a facultative component. A low thermic effect of food is associated with the development of obesity. This effect may be mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. Beta-adrenergic receptor knockout mice develop severe obesity, due to a failure of diet-induced thermogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2906718809\"><span class=\"h3\">Activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The final component of energy expenditure is activity and exercise, known as activity thermogenesis, which includes both exercise and nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT).

The central nervous system receives afferent signals from the periphery about deficits or surpluses of foods or alterations in the rate of fuel utilization. The brain processes this information and initiates metabolic and cognitive responses according to whether food is needed and if so, when and where to get it. The brain also initiates signals that alter metabolism of nutrients and the cognitive processes for food seeking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H300122679\"><span class=\"h3\">Afferent signals from fat and the gastrointestinal tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The afferent signals that carry messages about surpluses or deficits of nutrients include neural circuits, circulating hormones, and nutrients themselves. Among them, leptin is one of the most potent. Leptin production is closely correlated with body fat mass, and leptin can reduce food intake and increase the activity of the sympathetic nervous system.

Food intake increases in early life to reach a peak in the second decade, after which it declines. Men consistently eat more than women in concert with their higher fat-free mass. The age-related decline in caloric intake in men and women is associated with a slow decline in their energy expenditure. The fact that both men and women become more obese in middle age implies that the decline in energy expenditure is faster than the decline in food intake.

Gonadal steroids play a major role in the distribution of body fat. At the onset of puberty, boys experience a decrease in fat mass and increase in lean body mass, whereas women increase their body fat relative to their muscle mass. These differences persist throughout life.</p><p>Both gonadal steroid and GH secretion decline with age. This may explain the increase in visceral fat in men. In postmenopausal women, the decline in estrogen after menopause and age-associated decrease in GH may explain the relatively rapid increase in visceral fat.</p><p>The distribution of body fat is important clinically. Visceral fat is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (hypertension and coronary heart disease) and metabolic disorders (type 2 diabetes mellitus).
