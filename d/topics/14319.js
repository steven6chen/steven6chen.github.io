When severe, it interferes with the performance of daily activities, often leading to absenteeism from school, work, and other responsibilities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21086905\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY DYSMENORRHEA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For clinical purposes, dysmenorrhea is divided into two broad categories, primary and secondary:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary dysmenorrhea refers to the presence of recurrent, crampy, lower abdominal pain that occurs during menses in the absence of demonstrable disease that could account for these symptoms. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary dysmenorrhea has the same clinical features, but occurs in women with a disorder that could account for their symptoms, such as endometriosis, adenomyosis, or uterine fibroids. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H52181096\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In surveys, 50 to 90 percent of reproductive-aged women worldwide describe experiencing painful menstrual periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-10</a>]. The majority of these women are young and have primary dysmenorrhea. The prevalence of primary dysmenorrhea decreases with advancing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of women with primary dysmenorrhea do not have any risk factors for the disorder. In a systematic review that evaluated risk factors for dysmenorrhea, multiple demographic, environmental, gynecological, and psychological factors appeared to be associated with the disorder, including age &lt;30 years, body mass index &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> smoking, menarche before age 12, longer menstrual <span class=\"nowrap\">cycles/duration</span> of bleeding, irregular or heavy menstrual flow, and history of sexual assault [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Younger age at first childbirth and higher parity were associated with a reduced risk. There appears to be a (small) familial predisposition to primary dysmenorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prostaglandins released from endometrial sloughing at the beginning of menses play a major role in inducing contractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These contractions are nonrhythmic or incoordinate, occur at high frequency (more than 4 or 5 per 10 minutes), often begin from an elevated basal tone (more than 10 mmHg), and result in high intrauterine pressures (frequently more than 150 to 180 mmHg, sometimes exceeding 400 mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. When uterine pressure exceeds arterial pressure, uterine ischemia develops and anaerobic metabolites accumulate, which stimulate type C pain neurons resulting in dysmenorrhea. Activation of stretch receptors likely also play a role in the perception of pain.</p><p>This hypothesis is supported by multiple lines of evidence:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometrial concentrations of prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2 alpha are elevated in primary dysmenorrhea and correlate with the severity of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exogenous administration of prostaglandins reproduce the symptoms (uterine contractions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, backache) associated with primary dysmenorrhea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doppler studies show that women with primary dysmenorrhea have elevated uterine artery Doppler indices (ie, higher resistance to blood flow in the uterine arteries) during menses compared to women without dysmenorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with primary dysmenorrhea treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) note an improvement in symptoms over time in parallel with the decrease in intrauterine <span class=\"nowrap\">pressure/contractility</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59146\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59146 \">figure 1</a>) and menstrual fluid prostaglandin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21088032\"><span class=\"h3\">Presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary dysmenorrhea typically begins during adolescence, after ovulatory cycles first become established. Maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis leading to ovulation occurs at different rates; approximately 18 to 45 percent of adolescents have ovulatory cycles two years postmenarche, 45 to 70 percent by two to four years, and 80 percent by four to five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>The pain starts one to two days before or with the onset of menstrual bleeding and then gradually diminishes over 12 to 72 hours. It is recurrent, occurring in most, if not all, menstrual cycles. The pain is usually crampy and intermittently intense, but may be a continuous dull ache. It is usually confined to the lower abdomen and suprapubic area. Although the pain is usually strongest in the midline, some women also have severe back <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thigh pain. Nonmidline pain, especially if unilateral, suggests a uterine anomaly or alternative diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>The severity of the pain ranges from mild to severe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65347\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65347 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Secondary dysmenorrhea is the occurrence of painful menses in the presence of a disease that could account for the pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78903 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21086905\" class=\"local\">'Definitions of primary and secondary dysmenorrhea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary dysmenorrhea is caused by intense uterine contractions that result in uterine ischemia. Prostaglandins release from the endometrium at the beginning of menses and are a major cause of these contractions. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain begins with the onset of menses and gradually diminishes over 12 to 72 hours. Additional symptoms that may be present include nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, and a general sense of malaise. (See <a href=\"#H21088032\" class=\"local\">'Presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of primary dysmenorrhea is based upon the presence of characteristic clinical features in the absence of demonstrable disease that could account for the pain. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary dysmenorrhea is excluded primarily by history and physical examination. The most common causes of secondary dysmenorrhea are pelvic inflammatory disease and endometriosis. Laboratory tests and imaging studies are not mandatory to exclude disorders associated with secondary dysmenorrhea, but should be performed, as indicated, if pelvic disease is suspected. (See <a href=\"#H52181654\" class=\"local\">'Exclusion of secondary dysmenorrhea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combination of crampy pelvic pain and uterine bleeding is also characteristic of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. These disorders should be suspected in a woman with new onset of pelvic pain and recent menstrual irregularity, and are readily excluded by a negative pregnancy test. (See <a href=\"#H52181351\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Campbell MA, McGrath PJ.
