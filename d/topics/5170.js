By definition, these disorders do not meet diagnostic criteria for overt, symptomatic multiple myeloma or a lymphoproliferative disorder. The term MGRS was proposed in 2012 by the International Kidney and Monoclonal Gammopathy Research Group to collectively describe patients who would otherwise meet the criteria for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) but demonstrate renal insufficiency and monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition in the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-renal-significance/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The goal was to differentiate patients with MGUS, who have no evidence of end-organ damage, from those with MGRS, who are at risk of developing progressive renal disease. MGRS can also be associated with other hematologic disorders, including smoldering multiple myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-renal-significance/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>], smoldering Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-renal-significance/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-renal-significance/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>MGRS-associated kidney diseases encompass a wide spectrum of renal pathology and include such lesions as immunoglobulin-associated amyloidosis, monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease (MIDD), proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits (PGNMID), C3 glomerulopathy with monoclonal gammopathy, light chain proximal tubulopathy (Fanconi syndrome), and several others.</p><p>This topic will review the diagnosis and treatment of MGRS.

However, most of the kidney diseases that are associated with multiple myeloma, with the exception of light chain cast nephropathy and acute kidney injury caused by hypercalcemia, can occur in the absence of multiple myeloma or other hematologic malignancy. These renal disorders that are caused by the deposition of monoclonal immunoglobulins or their components meet criteria for the diagnosis of MGRS. The following studies illustrate the range of findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-renal-significance/abstract/7-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 474 patients with immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis, only 8 percent had evidence of multiple myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-renal-significance/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In two independent series of patients with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease (MIDD), 59 to 65 percent of patients had clinical evidence of multiple myeloma by virtue of having &gt;10 percent plasma cells in the bone marrow, and approximately 3 percent had evidence of a lymphoproliferative disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-renal-significance/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. A third study of patients treated for MIDD reported a diagnosis of multiple myeloma in only 20 percent when myeloma-defining events were used to establish the diagnosis of myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-renal-significance/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the largest series of patients with proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits (PGNMID), only 1 of 37 patients (3 percent) had multiple myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-renal-significance/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low rates of multiple myeloma have also been reported among patients with fibrillary glomerulonephritis (&lt;1 percent), immunotactoid glomerulopathy (13 percent), and light chain proximal tubulopathy (31 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-renal-significance/abstract/12,13,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,15,16</a>].</p><p/><p>Although MGRS is considered a nonmalignant or premalignant hematologic condition, its effects on the kidney are <strong>not</strong> benign, and patients with MGRS frequently develop progressive kidney disease and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In a study of 19 patients with MIDD, 12 of whom did not have evidence of myeloma, overall patient survival at five years was 70 percent, but renal survival was only 37 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-renal-significance/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Similarly, a retrospective study of 37 patients with PGNMID found that 38 percent developed persistent renal dysfunction, and 22 percent progressed to ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-renal-significance/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, patients with MGRS, most of whom would have been previously classified as having monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), have generally been undertreated or untreated. The reluctance to treat MGRS with chemotherapy directed against the pathogenic plasma cell or B cell clone is largely due to the fact that these patients do not meet criteria for the diagnosis of multiple myeloma or lymphoproliferative disorder. As an example, in a study of 63 patients with MIDD (22 of whom did not have multiple myeloma), nearly 30 percent of those without myeloma were not treated with cytotoxic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-renal-significance/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Among patients who did receive treatment, none received the standard myeloma therapy at the time of the study.</p><p>MGRS-related kidney diseases recur in most patients after kidney transplantation and can lead to rapid allograft loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-renal-significance/abstract/18-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-26</a>]. Recurrence rates are as high as 60, 71, and 86 percent among patients with fibrillary glomerulonephritis associated with monoclonal gammopathy, monoclonal membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and MIDD, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-renal-significance/abstract/18,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,23,24</a>].

These monoclonal proteins, which may be light chains, heavy chains, or intact immunoglobulins, are produced by small, nonmalignant or premalignant plasma cell or B cell clones. Deposition of the monoclonal proteins may occur within the glomeruli, tubules, vessels, or interstitium of the kidney, depending upon the specific biochemical characteristics of the pathogenic light <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> heavy chains involved.

By definition, these disorders do not meet diagnostic criteria for overt, symptomatic multiple myeloma or a lymphoproliferative disorder. The term MGRS collectively describes patients who would otherwise meet the criteria for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) but demonstrate renal insufficiency and monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition in the kidney. Although MGRS is considered a nonmalignant or premalignant hematologic condition, its effects on the kidney are <strong>not</strong> benign, and patients with MGRS frequently develop progressive kidney disease and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). (See <a href=\"#H3058111848\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4208192472\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In MGRS, the renal lesions are primarily caused by the abnormal deposition of monoclonal proteins in the kidney. These monoclonal proteins, which may be light chains, heavy chains, or intact immunoglobulins, are produced by small, nonmalignant or premalignant plasma cell or B cell clones. In addition to the deposition of monoclonal proteins within the kidney, other mechanisms for the pathogenesis of MGRS have been described. (See <a href=\"#H283393412\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MGRS-associated kidney diseases encompass a wide spectrum of renal pathology and can be categorized according to the ultrastructural characteristics of the deposits in the kidney. Deposits can be divided into those that are organized (ie, with substructure) and those that are nonorganized (ie, granular, without substructure). In some cases of MGRS, there are no visible deposits within the kidney. (See <a href=\"#H3679052794\" class=\"local\">'Classification according to pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney disease in patients with MGRS can present as a complication of a previously diagnosed nonmalignant or premalignant hematologic disorder (eg, MGUS, smoldering multiple myeloma) or as the initial clinical manifestation of a monoclonal gammopathy. MGRS can present with acute or subacute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, proteinuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nephrotic syndrome, or electrolyte abnormalities. The most common presenting symptoms are renal impairment and proteinuria, with or without hematuria. (See <a href=\"#H1529225576\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of MGRS should be suspected in the following patients:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All patients with a <strong>nonmalignant or premalignant</strong> monoclonal gammopathy (eg, MGUS, smoldering multiple myeloma, smoldering Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia, or monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis [MBL]) who present with unexplained renal impairment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteinuria. (See <a href=\"#H2364316923\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of MGRS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All patients who present with unexplained renal impairment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteinuria and are found to have a monoclonal gammopathy (ie, by serum or urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation or by serum free light chain assay) during their evaluation of renal disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In <strong>most</strong> patients suspected of having MGRS, we perform a kidney biopsy, unless contraindicated. The presence of monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits in the kidney establishes the diagnosis of MGRS. However, a kidney biopsy can be deferred in the following clinical circumstances:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients presenting with albuminuria or nephrotic syndrome who already have an established diagnosis of immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis based upon biopsies of nonkidney tissues. A presumptive diagnosis of renal AL amyloidosis can be made in these patients without a kidney biopsy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with monoclonal gammopathy who present with laboratory abnormalities consistent with Fanconi syndrome (eg, aminoaciduria, normoglycemic glycosuria, hypophosphatemia, hypouricemia, subnephrotic range proteinuria). Such patients have a presumptive diagnosis of light chain proximal tubulopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits in the kidney indicates the existence of a plasma cell, B cell, or lymphoplasmacytic clone that is responsible for the production of the monoclonal protein. In <strong>all</strong> patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MGRS, we perform monoclonal protein testing and a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy to characterize this clone in order to guide appropriate therapy. In patients who do <strong>not</strong> have a detectable clone with this testing <strong>or</strong> who have an IgM monoclonal protein, additional imaging studies (such as a computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, combined with positive emission tomography [PET], if available) to search for a B cell clone may be required. In addition, we perform flow cytometry of peripheral blood lymphocytes, which can detect small, low-grade clones. (See <a href=\"#H1052424639\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MGRS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of MGRS is determined primarily by the pathologic type of renal injury, the nature of the clone (either plasma cell, B cell, or lymphoplasmacytic) that is producing the nephrotoxic monoclonal immunoglobulin, and the likelihood of reversal of the renal damage. Once the specific renal lesion has been identified by kidney biopsy, we prefer a treatment approach that employs chemotherapy directed against the pathologic clone, with the primary goal of preserving kidney function. (See <a href=\"#H2564665860\" class=\"local\">'Overview of our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal therapy for patients with monoclonal gammopathy-associated proliferative glomerulonephritis (proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits [PGNMID] or C3 glomerulopathy with monoclonal gammopathy) is not known. Our treatment approach is based primarily upon our clinical experience. (See <a href=\"#H1140855288\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of proliferative glomerulonephritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with PGNMID who have a monoclonal protein of the same isotype detectable in the serum or urine, we treat with chemotherapy to eradicate the clone responsible for producing the monoclonal protein. In patients who have a <strong>non</strong>-IgM type (eg, IgG or IgA) monoclonal protein in the serum (or urine) and kidney, we administer a treatment regimen similar to that used to treat multiple myeloma. In patients who have an IgM monoclonal protein in the serum (or urine) and kidney, we administer a treatment regimen similar to that used to treat Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia. (See <a href=\"#H3671589232\" class=\"local\">'Patients with a detectable monoclonal protein in the serum or urine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with PGNMID who do <strong>not</strong> have a detectable monoclonal protein in the serum or urine, we prefer a more conservative approach to treatment. We treat these patients with antiproteinuric therapy (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) and blood pressure control for up to three months. We continue to monitor the patient for a monoclonal protein by serum and urine electrophoresis and immunofixation and serum free light chain assay. In patients who show no reduction in proteinuria or improvement in renal function, a trial of chemotherapy is reasonable. In this setting, however, we prefer to use less aggressive agents, given the uncertainty about the existence of a pathologic clone and the risk of adverse effects of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3518570225\" class=\"local\">'Patients without a detectable monoclonal protein in the serum or urine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with C3 glomerulopathy with monoclonal gammopathy, we typically treat with chemotherapy based upon the isotype of the circulating monoclonal protein detected in the serum or urine. This approach is similar to that used in patients with PGNMID who have a detectable serum or urine monoclonal protein. (See <a href=\"#H785774627\" class=\"local\">'Patients with C3 glomerulopathy with monoclonal gammopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In all patients with MGRS who are being actively treated, we obtain a serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation; 24-hour urine collection for total protein, protein electrophoresis, and immunofixation; serum free light chain assay; and serum creatinine on a monthly basis to monitor both the hematologic and renal response to therapy. In patients who have completed active treatment, we perform these studies every two to three months. However, a significant proportion of patients with MGRS do not have detectable circulating monoclonal proteins at baseline. In such patients, it is not possible to assess a hematologic response, and serum creatinine and quantification of proteinuria may be the only parameters that can be used to monitor the response to therapy.
