The prognosis was highly variable, and for over three decades the pathophysiology and treatment of this disease remained a mystery. With developments in molecular genetics, our understanding of the pathogenesis of PAP has improved significantly. At the same time, there were case reports of atypical forms of PAP arising in neonates, infants, and children. Today there is mounting evidence that most cases of pediatric PAP result from a genetic or acquired defect in surfactant metabolism, leading to excessive accumulation of this material in air spaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical features, and treatment of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in infants and children are discussed in this topic review.

The common characteristic is the accumulation of pulmonary surfactants in the alveolar space, which can be due to altered surfactant production, removal, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In infants and young children, PAP is most likely to be caused by inborn errors of surfactant metabolism or immune deficiencies, whereas the vast majority of cases in adults are autoimmune (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F115856\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115856 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital form</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The congenital form of PAP, also known as congenital alveolar proteinosis (CAP), includes inborn errors of surfactant metabolism, lysinuric protein intolerance, and mutations in the components of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor.</p><p>It is now recognized that the histopathologic manifestations of the congenital form are primarily interstitial changes, often with a relatively minor component of alveolar proteinosis, in contrast with the autoimmune (classic) form of PAP in which the alveolar proteinosis is prominent.

These rare disorders may produce familial or sporadic lung disease, with clinical presentations ranging from neonatal respiratory failure to childhood- or adult-onset interstitial lung disease. An overview of these disorders is presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71981\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71981 \">table 2</a>).

Thus, unlike adults with PAP, the majority of infants and children with PAP do not have the autoimmune form of the disease. As an example, in a study of 15 children with PAP, none had anti-GM-CSF antibodies in the serum and only one had anti-GM-CSF antibodies in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary form</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As in adults, acquired PAP in children can be seen with the following categories of disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in adults&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections &ndash; eg, Nocardia asteroides, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, Pneumocystis jirovecii, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematologic malignancies &ndash; eg, lymphoma, leukemia and GATA2 haploinsufficiency (which is often associated with a myelodysplastic syndrome).

In about one-third of infants with pathologic features suggesting a surfactant defect (interstitial expansion, type II epithelial cell hyperplasia, and limited lipoproteinaceous material in the alveolar spaces), no surfactant mutations have been identified. However, because of the similarities in histopathology it is likely that many of these children have defects in intracellular surfactant metabolism that have yet to be discovered. Because older children with PAP do not have anti-GM-CSF antibodies, the etiology in these patients remains unknown. It is possible that some of these children have mutations in CSF2RA, as pediatric patients with idiopathic PAP were reported prior to the discovery of this mutation.

Examination of the sediment using light microscopy reveals large amounts of amorphous, lipoproteinaceous material that stains brightly positive with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS); large macrophages may also be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-children/abstract/1,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,27,28</a>]. The differential cell count of BAL fluid shows macrophage predominance without inflammatory cells. EM is not routinely needed for diagnosis but can be helpful in validating the light microscopy findings. Also, infections should be excluded with this evaluation.</p><p>Although diagnosis of noncongenital PAP can be made based on clinical presentation and HRCT and BAL findings, histologic confirmation is often required. Studies in adults show that transbronchial biopsies are as reliable as open lung biopsies in establishing the diagnosis of PAP and should be utilized more often [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The diagnostic findings of PAP are accumulation of PAS-positive, lipoproteinaceous material in air spaces of otherwise preserved lung tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although genetic testing is the gold standard for the diagnosis of the congenital forms of PAP, lung biopsy can be useful in certain circumstances. In the neonate with respiratory failure, genetic testing that takes up to four weeks may delay timely diagnosis and referral for lung transplantation. In this case, lung biopsy can be virtually diagnostic of an inborn error of surfactant metabolism, especially if abnormal lamellar bodies are demonstrated. Also, some children have a lung biopsy consistent with an inborn error of surfactant metabolism, but no mutations are found. This suggests that there are mutations in other genes associated with surfactant metabolism that have yet to be discovered. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Idiopathic form'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonates with surfactant protein B (SFTPB) or ABCA3 mutations usually require mechanical ventilation for severe respiratory failure and are sometimes treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation because early diagnosis is difficult (lung biopsy is often deferred due to the severity of illness, and genetic testing takes time). In general, these interventions are futile. Treatment with corticosteroids, exogenous surfactant therapy, and whole lung lavage are also ineffective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Lung transplantation is the only treatment that appears to improve outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A retrospective review from a single institution reported lung transplantation for 28 infants with SFTPB, surfactant protein C (SFTPC), ABCA3 and NKX2.1 mutations, with significant morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Survival was 82 percent at one year posttransplant, and 56 percent at five years. </p><p>Treatment of lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) consists of protein-restricted diet and supplementation with oral citrulline. Transplantation is contraindicated for children with LPI and end-stage lung disease as fatal recurrence in the transplanted lung has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Infants and older children</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Antiinflammatory therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In infants and children with PAP caused by SFTPC and ABCA3 mutations, antiinflammatory therapy (eg, corticosteroids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydroxychloroquine</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>] has been suggested, but whether these treatments provide clinical benefit is unclear. The rationale for treatment is that abnormal protein folding as a result of these mutations leads to protein degradation within the endoplasmic reticulum and release of toxic mediators. Despite therapy, the disease is often slowly progressive and may ultimately require lung transplantation.

In young children, the small caliber of the airway poses a major obstacle. In some of these cases, partial or whole lung lavage has been accomplished using standard endotracheal tube intubation and hyperbaric oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-children/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>] and combined intubation and flexible bronchoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

In general, the objective is to lavage repeatedly until the recovered fluid contains little sedimentable material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Improvement of clinical symptoms and arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) is usually achieved within a few days. Resolution of pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiographs or computed tomography (CT) scans may take longer.

Many authors advocate massive pulmonary lavages only for children suffering from respiratory distress or the debilitating effects of the disease (ie, exercise intolerance, poor growth, and pulmonary hypertension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-children/abstract/28-30,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30,39,40</a>].

Four forms of PAP are recognized in children: congenital, autoimmune, secondary, and idiopathic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77313\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77313 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F115856\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115856 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The congenital form of PAP is usually caused by inborn errors of surfactant metabolism or by a defect in the plasma membrane transport of cationic amino acids (known as lysinuric protein intolerance [LPI]). The clinical presentation can range from severe respiratory failure in the neonatal period to more insidious symptoms of chronic interstitial lung disease in older children. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Congenital form'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Congenital PAP should be suspected in patients presenting with severe unexplained lung disease in the newborn period, or infants and children with diffuse disease involving the entire lung on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). These patients should be tested for an inborn error of surfactant metabolism (surfactant protein B [SFTPB], surfactant protein C [SFTPC], ABCA3, and NKX2.1), as well as for SLC7A7, colony-stimulating factor 2 receptor alpha (CSF2RA), and colony-stimulating factor 2 receptor beta (CSF2RB) mutations to detect lysinuric protein intolerance and mutations of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For neonates with severe congenital PAP, lung transplantation is the only treatment that appears to improve outcome. Prolonged mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and treatment with corticosteroids, exogenous surfactant therapy, or whole lung lavage are ineffective. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Neonates'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoimmune (acquired) PAP is mediated by antibodies to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (anti-GM-CSF) antibodies. This form accounts for almost all cases of PAP in adults but is rare in children. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Autoimmune form'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In older children, the diagnosis of PAP is usually raised during the course of an evaluation for nonspecific symptoms and signs of pulmonary disease. The diagnosis is suggested by radiographic findings, and confirmed by bronchoscopy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lung biopsy. These children should also be tested for anti-GM-CSF antibodies to evaluate for autoimmune PAP, although this form is rare in children.
