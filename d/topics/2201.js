Prescription medicines go by at least 2 different names: the generic name and a brand name. For example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">atorvastatin</a> is the generic name for a cholesterol-lowering medicine. Its brand name is &quot;Lipitor.&quot; Non-prescription medicines also go by different names.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82695867\"><span class=\"h1\">What is a generic name?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The generic name of a medicine is the name of the active ingredient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82695874\"><span class=\"h1\">What is a brand name?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The brand name of a medicine is the name given by the drug maker. The brand name can be easier to say than the generic name, but they are still the same medicine. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82695881\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I find out the brand and generic names of my medicine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The generic name is usually printed near the brand name on the prescription label (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F91797\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91797 \">figure 1</a>). You can also ask your doctor or pharmacist. You should know both names for each of your medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82695888\"><span class=\"h1\">What are generic medicines?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generic medicines are copies of brand-name medicines. They are usually less expensive. Generic medicines have the same active ingredient as the brand-name medicine they copy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82695901\"><span class=\"h1\">Do all medicines come as a generic copy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><strong>No</strong>. Although all medicines have a generic name, for many newer medicines you can't buy a generic version. That's because the maker of the brand has a patent. A patent means only the maker of the brand version is allowed to sell the medicine for several years. When the patent expires, other companies are allowed to make and sell generic copies. The table shows some examples of brand name medicines, their generic names, and whether less expensive generic copies are available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52676 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82695908\"><span class=\"h1\">What is the difference between a generic medicine and a brand?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The generic medicine can have a different shape, color, coating, or flavoring than the original brand name version. Also, generic medicines usually cost less.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82695922\"><span class=\"h1\">Why do generic medicines usually cost less than brand?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Makers of generic medicines can charge less for a medicine than the brand maker because they do not have to pay for developing or advertising the medicine. Developing new medicines and studying them can be very costly. When there is more than one maker of a generic drug, competition can help keep the price down.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82695935\"><span class=\"h1\">Are generic medicines as good as brand?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><strong>Yes</strong>. Makers of generic medicines must follow the same government rules about strength, quality, and purity as makers of brand-name medicines. In the US, Canada, and Europe, the government requires careful testing of generic copies to make sure they will work as well as the brand medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82695942\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I switch to a generic medicine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you would like to save money by buying generic medicines instead of brand, ask your doctor or pharmacist if there are generic medicines that could work for you.</p><p>Anytime you switch a medicine, you must work closely with your doctor. With some switches, your doctor might need to check to be sure it is working right for you.</p><p>Anytime you replace one medicine with another, for any reason, make sure you learn what the new medicine looks like and which one it is replacing. People sometimes accidentally take the same medicine twice because the brand name and generic pills look different and they think they are taking 2 different medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82695949\"><span class=\"h1\">If there is a generic will I get it automatically?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not always. It depends on laws in your area and instructions from your doctor. Check with your pharmacy and find out if there is a generic copy and if you are getting it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29401161\"><span class=\"h1\">Do non-prescription medicines also have brand and generic names?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><strong>Yes</strong>. A medicine you buy without a prescription is also called an &quot;over-the-counter&quot; medicine. These are sold under many different brand names and many different store brands, even though each has the same medicine in it.</p><p>One example is the common non-prescription pain reliever &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a>,&quot; (called &quot;paracetamol&quot; outside the United States). Acetaminophen is sold under many different brand names, such as Tylenol and Panadol, and under store brands with names like &quot;Extra-Strength Pain Relief&quot; tablets or &quot;Non-Aspirin&quot; tablets. All of these can contain the same medicine, acetaminophen. Also, there are many cold and cough products that contain several different medicines, often including acetaminophen.</p><p>Taking too much of the same medicine could be harmful. Always read the generic names on the label of your non-prescription medicines to be sure you are not taking more than one product that has the same medicine in it. In the US, the generic names of non-prescription medicine are on the label or box where it says <strong>Drug Facts</strong> and <strong>Active ingredient</strong> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73468\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73468 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29401311\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=side-effects-from-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Side effects from medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
