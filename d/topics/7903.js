First, the response to growth hormone is highly variable, probably because of the heterogeneous endocrinologic profile in children with ISS, and those children who respond to growth hormone treatment may have only modest increases in linear growth. Second, there is little evidence that short stature represents a substantial psychosocial burden to most short children. The possible psychosocial benefit must be weighed against the substantial cost and possible adverse effects of treatment.</p><p>The efficacy and potential risks of growth hormone and alternative treatments for children with ISS are discussed below. The clinical evaluation of children with short stature is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-short-stature\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of short stature&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H998221225\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic short stature (ISS) is a clinical description rather than a disease. A practical definition of ISS is a height below 2 standard deviations (SD) of the mean for age (ie, below the 2.3<sup>rd</sup> percentile), in the absence of any endocrine, metabolic, or other disease that explains the short stature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In defining ISS for the indication of growth hormone treatment, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) uses the more stringent criterion of 2.25 SD below the mean (ie, the 1.2<sup>nd</sup> percentile), and a predicted adult height that is below the normal range; this corresponds to an adult height &lt;63 inches for males and &lt;59 inches for females. The clinical approach to diagnosis of ISS is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature&quot;</a>.) </p><p>ISS is generally considered a normal variant of growth (since pathological causes are excluded, by definition). Other normal variants are familial short stature (FSS) and constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP), sometimes called constitutional short stature for prepubertal children. There is ongoing controversy about the nomenclature of ISS. We use the term to refer to nonfamilial cases, but some other experts consider FSS and CDGP to be subcategories of ISS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. In either case, it is clear that there is considerable overlap between these variants, and many healthy children with short stature have growth characteristics consistent with more than one of these categories. The term ISS is generally reserved for children at the more severe end of the spectrum in each category, but the distinction between normal and abnormal growth patterns is not clear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-short-stature#H297546528\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of short stature&quot;, section on 'Normal variants of growth'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocrine findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with ISS often have normal height velocity (often near or at the lower limit of normal), no biochemical or other evidence for a specific growth-restricting condition, and have normal results of growth hormone stimulation tests. Thus, children with ISS do not have growth hormone deficiency according to the classic criteria. </p><p>Nonetheless, some children with ISS have relatively low serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and normal or elevated serum growth hormone, suggesting that they may be relatively insensitive to the effects of growth hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. These children may respond to supraphysiologic levels of growth hormone given as treatment or to direct stimulation by IGF-I. However, a reduced level of IGF-I, in combination with a normal or minimally elevated growth hormone level, is much more often the result of chronic illness or undernutrition, which is often concomitantly present in a short child. IGF-I results should be interpreted in the context of the child's age because levels normally increase with age, especially during puberty. These caveats should be considered when interpreting the endocrine findings of a child with short stature. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Other treatments'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency in children&quot;, section on 'IGF-I and IGFBP-3'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Exclusion of other diagnoses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many systemic diseases and conditions may contribute to short stature, including renal, neoplastic, pulmonary, cardiac, gastrointestinal, immunological, and metabolic disease. In addition, some therapies such as corticosteroid treatment can cause growth failure. Presence of significant disease in these categories precludes the diagnosis ISS. </p><p>The evaluation for short stature always begins with analysis of height velocity using serial measurements of height, interpretation of the child's growth trajectory in the context of parental heights, and, in most cases, radiographic determination of bone age to permit an estimate of adult height and to evaluate for growth potential. However, even with bone age determination, adult height predictions have only moderate accuracy. In otherwise healthy children, the yield of additional laboratory testing is extremely low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. There is some controversy about the extent of testing that should be performed for children and adolescents with presumed ISS. Because of the low diagnostic yield and high cost, we suggest performing laboratory testing only selectively in otherwise asymptomatic children, as outlined in a separate topic review. Due to the possibility of skeletal dysplasia in children with presumed ISS, careful attention should be paid to body proportions (limbs disproportionately short for the trunk, or vice versa). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature#H31798098\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature&quot;, section on 'Features suggesting genetic or endocrine disease'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1145908467\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial functioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with ISS have normal psychosocial functioning. In a population-based sample, negative stereotypes regarding the social adjustment of individuals were noted (eg, teasing and bullying, less social acceptance, and fewer friends) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A few short children had problems with peer relationships, but short stature could not be established as the <strong>cause</strong> of the disturbance. In most children with extremes of short or tall stature, there is minimal impact on peer perceptions of social behavior, friendship, or peer acceptance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, the psychosocial effects of severe short stature (height &lt;-2.5 SD) have not been adequately studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is likely that there is substantial variation in the psychological effects of short stature, and that shortness has adverse effects on some individuals but not in others. </p><p>Clinic-based populations may display greater psychosocial dysfunction. Children referred for treatment may have significantly more externalizing behavior problems and poorer social skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, in this population, most problems were identified by the parents' report, and children tended to score normally on measures of self-esteem and functioning when based on the child's self-report or report of teachers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Children referred for medical treatment for their short stature likely represent a population selected for a higher level of parental concern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">GROWTH HORMONE THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Growth hormone therapy for children with idiopathic short stature (ISS) is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The indication is for children with current height below -2.25 standard deviations (SD) of the mean, in whom the epiphyses are not closed, and whose expected adult height (based on bone age) is below the normal range; this corresponds to an adult height less than 63 inches (160 cm) for males and 59 inches (150 cm) for females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Growth hormone is not approved for treatment of ISS in most other countries, including the European Union. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature#H64002967\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature&quot;, section on 'Prediction of adult height'</a>.) </p><p>Growth hormone therapy should ideally be initiated in early childhood, for optimal efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H998223393\"><span class=\"h2\">Decision to treat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite FDA approval, the use of growth hormone for children and adolescents with ISS remains controversial. Guidelines recommend <strong>against</strong> the routine use of growth hormone for every child with ISS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Instead, the decision about whether to use growth hormone should be made on a case-by-case basis after a detailed discussion with the child and family. This is because there are several limitations and uncertainties about the use of growth hormone therapy for children with ISS. Understanding these limitations informs a practical approach to selecting patients for growth hormone therapy. &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Limitations and uncertainties</strong>: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A majority of children with short stature will experience some catch-up growth during puberty <strong>without</strong> growth hormone treatment. In one study of children with ISS who were not treated with growth hormone, height was approximately 2.7 SD below the mean during puberty, but increased to approximately 1.5 SD below the mean by adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The adult heights were 5 to 6 cm below target height. Other studies report a spontaneous height increase of between 0.5 and 1.9 SD in untreated children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Spontaneous increase is most likely in children with constitutional delay in growth and puberty (CDGP) as compared with the familial short stature (FSS) pattern of growth (because of delayed bone age in the former, but not in the latter). That said, the distinctions between these two groups are not always clear and the degree of spontaneous catch-up growth cannot be accurately predicted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-short-stature#H297546528\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of short stature&quot;, section on 'Normal variants of growth'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There is little evidence that short stature has a consistent detrimental effect on an individual's psychosocial or physical functioning. (See <a href=\"#H998223496\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial considerations'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The available evidence suggests only modest efficacy for growth hormone treatment in children and adolescents with ISS, which must be weighed against the potential adverse physiological, psychosocial, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> financial effects of the treatment. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Safety'</a> below and <a href=\"#H998223496\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial considerations'</a> below and <a href=\"#H998223883\" class=\"local\">'Costs'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There is substantial interindividual variability in responsiveness to GH among children with ISS, and some children probably do not respond to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Moreover, it is difficult to predict responsiveness to growth hormone treatment for the typical short child, due to the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of the condition, inconsistent criteria used for the definition of ISS, and variable growth hormone treatment doses used in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. Clinical trials tend to enroll children with more severe short stature, so the reported growth response may not be generalizable to the less severe short stature seen in a clinical population. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Practical solutions</strong> &ndash; These uncertainties yield the following practical approaches to decisions about growth hormone therapy:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The evaluation should attempt to identify children with growth patterns consistent with CDGP because they are likely to have catch-up growth without growth hormone treatment. Clinical evidence supporting CDGP includes delayed bone age <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> history of delayed growth and puberty in a parent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51582\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51582 \">table 1</a>). Moreover, adolescent boys with CDGP and moderate short stature (taller than -2.5 SD) are more appropriately treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">testosterone</a> replacement rather than growth hormone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Testosterone'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The family should be aware that short stature does not generally have a detrimental effect on psychosocial functioning. At the same time, efforts should be made to determine if this is likely to be the case for the individual patient. (See <a href=\"#H998223496\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial considerations'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>It is essential to establish realistic expectations about the likely growth outcome of growth hormone therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1145907380\" class=\"local\">'Expectations'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If growth hormone therapy is undertaken for ISS, growth should be reevaluated after a treatment trial and therapy continued only for children with accelerated growth. (See <a href=\"#H998222055\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The decision to treat should be made collaboratively with the family and patient after a full discussion of each of these issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The psychosocial considerations should be emphasized because they depend on individual patient characteristics and are often misunderstood, as detailed in the following section. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H998223496\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychosocial considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to treat children and adolescents with ISS using growth hormone requires complex psychosocial considerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/9,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,20</a>]. Growth hormone treatment should be considered only if the short stature represents a disability to the child and is not amenable to counseling and reassurance, and if growth augmentation is likely to provide psychosocial benefit to the child. If growth hormone treatment achieves an increase in height, it might be expected to improve a child's self-image and social efficacy. On the other hand, growth hormone treatment could have adverse psychosocial consequences due to the extreme focus on a child's stature conferred by the treatment itself, in addition to the treatment burden from daily subcutaneous injections. In addition, a meaningful <span class=\"nowrap\">benefit/cost</span> assessment must be applied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>As noted above, most patients with ISS have normal psychosocial functioning, and that short stature has minimal impact on peer acceptance or friendships. However, the psychosocial effects of severe short stature have not been adequately studied, and it is likely that shortness have adverse effects in some individuals but not in others (see <a href=\"#H1145908467\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial functioning'</a> above). Thus, the decision to treat requires objective assessment of the psychosocial effects of short stature in the individual patient, using interviewing techniques <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a standardized instrument that measures health-related quality of life, such as the QoLISSY instrument that was specifically developed for children and adolescents with short stature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In addition, the provider should explain to the patient and family that short stature does not have negative psychosocial effects for most individuals, as outlined below. Nonpharmacologic options for promoting psychosocial adjustment also should be considered, including coping strategies and social support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Treatment with growth hormone appears to have little or no effect on psychosocial outcomes, according to the few small studies that have addressed this issue. (See <a href=\"#H1145908596\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial outcomes'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1145907380\"><span class=\"h3\">Expectations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When considering growth hormone therapy, it is essential to establish realistic expectations. Children presenting for growth hormone therapy often believe that the treatment will make them of average height or taller than average. However, even if the treatment is successful, most patients will still be short as adults. As an example, if a person's predicted adult height is 155 cm (61 inches), and growth hormone therapy is successful in adding 5 cm (2 inches), the adult height will be 160 cm (63 inches). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H998223883\"><span class=\"h3\">Costs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment costs of growth hormone therapy are substantial and present an important consideration for allocation of medical resources. In 2011, the estimated cost of growth hormone therapy in Europe was about &euro;20,000 per year of treatment, which corresponds to about &euro;27,000 per centimeter gained (or $90,000 per inch) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]; corresponding costs of treatment in the United States are likely to exceed $100,000 per inch. This is a significant expense for any health system and potentially diverts a limited pool of resources away from other needs. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1145908508\"><span class=\"h3\">Height outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of the published clinical trials of growth hormone treatment in children and adolescents with ISS is complicated by the use of variable inclusion criteria, growth hormone doses, and outcomes, small sample sizes, high dropout rates (usually skewed to those with the smallest response), and lack of an adequate control group (in most studies). The studies generally support the view that growth hormone treatment results in modest increases in short-term growth rates and in adult height, although treated individuals remain relatively short compared with their peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/15-19,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19,24</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis that included controlled and uncontrolled trials performed from 1985 to 2000 showed that growth hormone treatment leads to increases in short-term height velocity and adult height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. There was an average increase of 0.84 SD in patients treated with growth hormone therapy as compared with untreated patients, corresponding to a height increase of approximately 4 to 6 cm (range, 2.3 to 8.7 cm). The mean treatment duration in these studies was 5.3 years.

Placebo-controlled trials have generally shown no increase in these or other adverse effects as compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>], but these studies are not adequately powered to detect rare adverse events, have limited length of follow-up, and use a variety of dosing schemes.

These include edema, cardiomyopathy, insulin resistance, stroke, increased intraocular pressure, arthropathy, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and gynecomastia. Some, but not all, studies of adults with acromegaly have suggested an increased incidence of colonic and uterine neoplasia. The risks of giving excessive doses of exogenous growth hormone may theoretically be reduced by using IGF-I targeted dosing strategies.

We choose this target based on general considerations of cost-effectiveness and to avoid theoretical safety concerns that may be associated with excessive growth hormone dosing. If IGF-I levels are consistently elevated (&gt;2.5 SD), we reduce the growth hormone dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. We check IGF-I levels approximately four weeks after beginning therapy or changing the growth hormone dose, and approximately every 6 to 12 months thereafter, similar to the approach we use for patients with growth hormone deficiency. Optimization and cost-effectiveness of this technique require further study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

The utility of this approach for children with ISS is inferential and based on preliminary data. The rationale is that children with ISS may have a variety of abnormalities in the growth hormone-IGF-I axis, conferring varied levels of growth hormone resistance. Some studies in children with growth hormone deficiency or ISS suggest growth hormone responsiveness is closely associated with IGF-I levels during treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/15,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,40</a>]. In addition, some side effects of growth hormone, such as arthralgias and edema, are associated with supraphysiologic IGF-I levels in other populations. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Safety'</a> above.)</p><p>Preliminary evidence supporting IGF-targeted dosing in children with ISS comes from a randomized trial in 102 children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Growth hormone dosing was adjusted to produce a low-target IGF-I level (0 &plusmn; 0.5 SD from the mean for age and gender) or a high target IGF-I level (2 &plusmn; 0.5 SD). Children with the higher IGF-I target level grew at a faster rate, although they required more than 2.5 times the amount of growth hormone (median dose of 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/day)</span> as compared with the low-IGF-I target group. There was a wide range of final doses (up to 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/day)</span>. Adverse event profiles were similar in both groups. Within each treatment group (low and high IGF-I target), the ISS subjects showed significantly less growth than a group of growth hormone deficient subjects, consistent with the hypothesis that some children with ISS have growth hormone resistance. This study is consistent with other observations suggesting that the response of IGF-I to growth hormone administration correlates with growth hormone responsiveness in populations with ISS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. </p><p>For patients with ISS and significant growth hormone resistance (ie, those with very low IGF-I levels, sometimes referred to as &quot;partial growth hormone insensitivity&quot; or &quot;partial IGF-I deficiency&quot;), the optimal approach to treatment is unclear. Some of these children may require higher growth hormone doses to achieve a growth response, whereas others seem to respond particularly well to standard doses of growth hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature/abstract/39,41,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,41,43</a>]. Moreover, this is also the group for which direct replacement of IGF-I may be most effective. Clinical trials will be necessary to determine the roles of growth hormone versus recombinant IGF-I, or growth hormone combined with recombinant IGF-I, in subsets of children with ISS.

In this setting, it is reasonable to proceed with a trial of growth hormone therapy, recognizing that responsiveness to growth hormone is highly variable in this group of patients.

If the family desires growth hormone therapy for such children, we offer a six-month trial of growth hormone treatment to determine growth hormone responsiveness. If growth does not accelerate significantly during the treatment trial, then we do not continue treatment. In this case, treatment with recombinant IGF-I might be considered. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Endocrine findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Other treatments'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">testosterone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxandrolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxandrolone</a> is an option for boys with mild or moderate short stature and whose puberty and bone age are delayed but with predicted adult height in the normal range (ie, those with features of constitutional delay of growth and puberty [CDGP]). Testosterone increases height velocity and pubertal development but does not increase adult height.
