IE among IDUs has historically been more common in males (ratio 3:1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-injection-drug-users/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]; however, data from the United States suggest an increasing proportion of females, with a similar proportion of males and females in the 15- to 24-year-old age category [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-injection-drug-users/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The average age of patients with IE and IDU is generally younger than for the age of patients with IE and no history of IDU (31 versus 42 years in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-injection-drug-users/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In the United States, use of heroin nearly doubled between 2006 and 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-injection-drug-users/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The rate of IDU-related IE has increased concomitantly from 6 to 8 percent of hospitalizations (between 2000 and 2008) to 12 percent (in 2013). Over this interval, IDU-related IE has trended toward younger patients, a higher proportion of whites, and a more similar distribution of males versus females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-injection-drug-users/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

One study of IDU-related IE in San Francisco found a possible association between heroin use and tricuspid valve involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-injection-drug-users/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Pulmonic valve involvement is relatively uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-injection-drug-users/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In an autopsy series including 80 IDUs with a history of IE, isolated tricuspid valve involvement was observed in 30 percent of cases, aortic or mitral valve involvement was observed in 41 percent of cases, and involvement of both right and left-sided valves was observed in 16 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-injection-drug-users/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Therefore, a number of studies have examined short-course (two-week) or alternative therapeutic regimens for patients with a history of IDU and staphylococcal IE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55417\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55417 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>In general, short-course intravenous or oral regimens are not suitable for patients with IE involving the aortic or mitral valve, patients with IE due to highly resistant organisms (such as methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em>), or patients with complications (such as heart failure or perivalvular abscesses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-injection-drug-users/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In addition, unacceptably high rates of failure have been observed with short-course regimens for <em>S. aureus</em> infections that utilize <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> or other non&ndash;beta-lactam antimicrobial agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-injection-drug-users/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p>There are data demonstrating some efficacy of combination therapy for treatment of IE in IDUs, although, in general, the studies have not been randomized or blinded, and follow-up of all treated patients was not always possible. For example, among patients with right-sided IE due to methicillin-sensitive strains of <em>S. aureus</em>, combination therapy with a semi-synthetic penicillinase-resistant beta-lactam agent plus an aminoglycoside has been shown to be as successful as a longer course of therapy using a beta-lactam agent alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-injection-drug-users/abstract/35,37,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,37,39,40</a>]. In addition, some success has been observed among small groups of patients with right-sided staphylococcal IE and a history of IDU using combination therapy with oral regimens, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>, with or without a short course of intravenous therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-injection-drug-users/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>].</p><p>One randomized prospective study of right-sided endocarditis in 44 IDUs showed that combination oral therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> was as effective as parenteral therapy for staphylococcal endocarditis in patients in whom oral therapy could be closely supervised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-injection-drug-users/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In this trial, all patients received parenteral therapy for the first five days; thereafter, 19 patients completed one month of therapy with oral rifampin and ciprofloxacin, and 25 received one month of parenteral therapy. There was no significant difference in treatment failures among patients receiving oral versus parenteral therapy (1 of 19 for oral versus 3 of 25 for parenteral therapy).</p><p>In light of these limitations, we rarely utilize oral regimens to treat IE in IDUs; candidates to be considered for such therapy should meet strict criteria, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tricuspid valve involvement only</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection due to an organism with in vitro susceptibility to oral agents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term intravenous therapy is difficult or impossible for social or logistic reasons</p><p/><p>Careful outpatient follow-up and monitoring of response to therapy is important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for surgery in patients with IE and concurrent IDU are generally the same as for other patients with IE.

IE among IDUs is more common in males, although the proportion of females is increasing. The average age of patients with IE and IDU is generally younger than for the age of patients with IE and no history of IDU. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of factors may uniquely predispose IDUs to IE. These include injection of particulate matter that causes endothelial damage to the tricuspid valve, as well as systemic injection of microorganisms present on the skin or in the drug, diluents, or filters. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> accounts for more than one-half of cases of IE among IDUs. Streptococci and enterococci are the next most common pathogens. Less commonly, fungi and gram-negative bacilli can also cause IE in IDUs. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most cases of right-sided IE occur among IDUs, and a majority of IDUs with IE have right-sided infections. The tricuspid valve is involved more frequently than the pulmonic valve. In the setting of isolated tricuspid IE, patients can present with acute symptoms in the absence of a heart murmur or peripheral stigmata of endocarditis; blood cultures are usually positive. Echocardiography should be pursued for patients with positive blood cultures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> for patients with evidence of septic pulmonary emboli. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice and duration of antibiotic therapy for treatment of IDUs with IE are generally the same as for other patients with IE. These decisions are dictated by the identity and antimicrobial susceptibility results of the infecting pathogen. In addition, indications for surgery in patients with IE and concurrent IDU are also generally the same as for other patients with IE. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-therapy-of-native-valve-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial therapy of native valve endocarditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications and outcome of infective endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, short-course regimens are not appropriate for IDUs with IE, particularly for patients with involvement of the aortic or mitral valve, patients with IE due to highly resistant organisms (including methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em>), and patients with complications, such as heart failure or perivalvular abscesses. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among IDUs, patients with tricuspid valve IE have lower case fatality rate than patients with aortic valve IE or other forms of IE. Factors associated with increased mortality include vegetation size &gt;2 cm and fungal etiology of infection.
