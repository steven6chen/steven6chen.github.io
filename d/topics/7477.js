There are different kinds of fractures, depending on how the bone breaks. When a bone breaks, it might crack, break all the way through, or shatter. If a broken bone sticks out of the skin or can be seen through a wound, doctors call it an &quot;open&quot; fracture. If the bone does not stick out of the skin or cannot be seen through a wound, doctors call it a &quot;closed&quot; fracture.</p><p>People with a condition called osteoporosis have a higher chance of getting a fracture. That's because osteoporosis makes a person's bones weak. This condition is especially common in older women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7956811\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms depend on which bone breaks and the kind of break it is. Common symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain, swelling, or bruising over the area</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The area looking abnormal, bent, or not the usual shape</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not being able to move or put weight on that part of the body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numbness in the area of the broken bone</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7956826\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms, do an exam, and take an X-ray. He or she might do other imaging tests, such as a CT or bone scan. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7956841\"><span class=\"h1\">How are fractures treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends, in part, on the type of fracture you have and how serious it is. The goal of treatment is to have the ends of the broken bone line up with each other so that the bone can heal.</p><p>If the ends of your broken bone are already in line with each other, your doctor will put a cast, splint, or brace on that part of the body. The cast, splint, or brace will keep your bone in the correct position so that it can heal.</p><p>If the ends of your broken bone are not in line with each other, your doctor will need to line them up. To do this, he or she can move your bone to the correct position without doing surgery, and then put a cast, splint, or brace on.</p><p>He or she can also do surgery to put your bone back in the correct position. This can involve:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using screws, pins, rods, or plates to fix a bone inside the body</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting pins or screws through the skin and into the bone, and then attaching the pins or screws to a bar that is outside the skin</p><p/><p>Your doctor will also treat your pain. If you have a severe fracture, he or she can prescribe a strong pain medicine. If you have a mild fracture, he or she might recommend that you take an over-the-counter medicine for your pain. Over-the counter medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p>After your bone heals, your doctor might recommend that you work with a physical therapist (exercise expert). The physical therapist can show you exercises and stretches to strengthen your muscles and help your joints move more easily.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7956856\"><span class=\"h1\">How long do fractures take to heal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on the body part involved and the type of fracture. Most fractures take weeks to months to heal. Fractures in children usually heal faster than fractures in adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7956871\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything to improve the healing process?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions while your fracture is healing. For example, he or she will probably recommend that you eat a healthy diet that includes getting enough calcium, protein, and vitamin D (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79375 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67824\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67824 \">table 1</a>). He or she will also probably recommend that you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not play certain sports</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not smoke &ndash; If you smoke, it can take longer for your fracture to heal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not get your cast wet, if you have a cast that shouldn't get wet</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7956886\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor or nurse will tell you when to call him or her. In general, you should call if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your pain, swelling, or other symptoms get worse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You get a fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You can't move part of your body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You get your cast wet, and it's not supposed to get wet</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7956901\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to prevent getting another fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To protect your body from getting hurt, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear safety gear when you bike, ski, rollerblade, or do activities where you could get hurt. Safety gear can include helmets, elbow pads, knee pads, and shin pads.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep walkways clear of clutter, and remove or tack down loose rugs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear a seatbelt every time you ride or drive in a car.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put a non-slip mat in the bathtub and handrails on the stairs (especially for older people).</p><p/><p>To help your bones stay strong so that they don't break easily, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat and drink foods with a lot of calcium, vitamin D, and protein. Calcium and vitamin D are nutrients that help keep bones strong.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get regular exercise, even if it's just taking a daily walk.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7956916\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cast-and-splint-care-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cast and splint care (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoporosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-wrist-injuries-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Common wrist injuries (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=finger-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Finger fracture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clavicle-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Clavicle fracture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hip-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hip fracture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rib-fractures-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rib fractures in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ankle-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ankle fracture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shinbone-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Shinbone fracture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertebral-compression-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vertebral compression fracture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=boxers-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Boxer's fracture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neck-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Neck fracture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pelvic fracture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=toe-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Toe fracture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=paget-disease-of-bone-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Paget disease of bone (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
