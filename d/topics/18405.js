The options for drug therapy for these women are oral contraceptives, antiandrogens, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. Consideration of GnRH agonist therapy is based upon the assumption that the hyperandrogenism is at least in part gonadotropin-dependent, because the action of chronic GnRH agonist therapy (as opposed to physiologic endogenous pulsatile GnRH secretion) is to inhibit luteinizing hormone (LH) and to a lesser extent follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion, thereby leading to a decline in ovarian function and consequently ovarian androgen production (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51212\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51212 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of gonadotropin-releasing hormone&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The role of GnRH agonist therapy in women with hyperandrogenism and hirsutism will be reviewed here. Any therapy that decreases androgen production, such as the administration of a GnRH agonist, must be continued for at least six months before its efficacy can be judged. Decreasing androgen secretion slows the growth of new hair follicles, but has little effect on existing ones, which must complete their life span before the hair is lost. Other therapies for hirsutism are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hirsutism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hirsutism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy should be considered for those women with ovarian hyperandrogenism who do not respond adequately to oral contraceptive therapy with or without an antiandrogen such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hirsutism#H3126952879\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hirsutism&quot;, section on 'Treatments not recommended'</a>). This situation is most likely to occur in women who have marked menstrual disturbances and signs of virilization in addition to hirsutism. Unlike women with hirsutism alone, these women usually have unequivocal increases in serum testosterone concentrations and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or ovarian hyperthecosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and causes of hirsutism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The reasons for not using a GnRH agonist as primary therapy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GnRH agonist therapy alone causes severe hypoestrogenism, and therefore estrogen-progestin supplementation must be given if therapy is continued for more than a few months, as is necessary in women with hyperandrogenism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The agonist must be given parenterally and is therefore inconvenient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cost of GnRH agonist therapy is high compared with other available therapies.</p><p/><p>In 2008, the Endocrine Society published clinical guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women. They suggested against the routine use of GnRH agonists for hirsutism, for the reasons noted above, and because there are other effective therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gnrh-agonists-in-the-treatment-of-hyperandrogenism-and-hirsutism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL RESPONSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy alone in women with ovarian hyperandrogenism has been demonstrated in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gnrh-agonists-in-the-treatment-of-hyperandrogenism-and-hirsutism/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. One study, as an example, evaluated eight women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and compared their serum hormonal values in response to daily injection of a GnRH agonist for six months with the values in women who had undergone bilateral oophorectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gnrh-agonists-in-the-treatment-of-hyperandrogenism-and-hirsutism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Serum estradiol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estrone</a>, progesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone concentrations decreased in one month to the concentrations present in the women after oophorectomy and remained low thereafter. <strong>Adrenal</strong> steroid production was not affected. Four of the women with PCOS had hot flashes, five had decreased hair growth, and all had a subjective reduction in skin oiliness.</p><p>In another study, six women with hirsutism were treated with the GnRH agonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nafarelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nafarelin</a> for six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gnrh-agonists-in-the-treatment-of-hyperandrogenism-and-hirsutism/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Their serum androgen concentrations decreased markedly within one month; as an example, the mean serum total testosterone concentration fell from 77 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (2.7 to 1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> the mean serum free testosterone concentration decreased from 1.1 to 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (38 to 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L),</span> and the mean serum androstenedione concentration decreased from 240 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (8.4 to 4.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L);</span> the values remained low for the remainder of the treatment period. Clinically, hair growth slowed, hair texture became finer, and the Ferriman-Gallwey hirsutism score decreased in four women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">COMBINED GnRH AGONIST-ESTROGEN THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy in reducing ovarian androgen and estrogen secretion, paired with the unacceptability of severe estrogen deficiency in premenopausal women, led to studies of combined GnRH agonist and estrogen therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gnrh-agonists-in-the-treatment-of-hyperandrogenism-and-hirsutism/abstract/6-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-14</a>]. A progestin must also be given to ensure regular endometrial shedding and avoid endometrial hyperplasia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of combined therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estrogen does not appear to interfere with the beneficial effect of GnRH agonist therapy on excessive hair growth and may even enhance it. As an example, a six-month study randomly assigned 22 women with hirsutism to receive the long-acting GnRH agonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triptorelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triptorelin</a> (Decapeptyl) alone or with estrogen therapy (0.625 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of conjugated estrogens for 21 <span class=\"nowrap\">days/month</span> and 10 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> on days 12 to 21) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gnrh-agonists-in-the-treatment-of-hyperandrogenism-and-hirsutism/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Serum androgen concentrations decreased in both groups, although the reductions in serum total and free testosterone were greater in the group receiving combined GnRH agonist-estrogen therapy. The Ferriman-Gallwey hirsutism score also decreased more in the women receiving combined therapy (4.1 versus 2.5), while vasomotor symptoms occurred only in the women receiving triptorelin alone.</p><p>A second study found similar reductions in serum androgen concentrations in women receiving the GnRH agonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=goserelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">goserelin</a> alone or with estrogen therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gnrh-agonists-in-the-treatment-of-hyperandrogenism-and-hirsutism/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Bleeding and premenstrual symptoms necessitated withdrawal of therapy in 3 of 10 women treated with estrogen.</p><p>An oral contraceptive also can be given to prevent estrogen deficiency without altering the therapeutic efficacy of the GnRH agonist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gnrh-agonists-in-the-treatment-of-hyperandrogenism-and-hirsutism/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. In one study, as an example, 33 women with hirsutism were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a> alone, leuprolide plus a combination monophasic oral contraceptive, or an oral contraceptive alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gnrh-agonists-in-the-treatment-of-hyperandrogenism-and-hirsutism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The fall in serum free testosterone concentrations was significantly greater in the leuprolide plus oral contraceptive group as compared with either of the other groups, because the leuprolide reduced ovarian testosterone secretion and the estrogen raised serum sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations, thereby increasing binding of the testosterone that was produced. However, the greater decrease in serum free testosterone concentrations in the combined therapy group was not associated with greater clinical benefit; the decreases in facial hair density and hirsutism score were similar in both GnRH therapy groups.</p><p>The combination of a GnRH agonist and an oral contraceptive is somewhat less effective (and far more costly) than antiandrogen and oral contraceptive therapy. In a study of 38 women with hirsutism randomly assigned to receive an oral contraceptive and either the GnRH agonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triptorelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triptorelin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproterone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyproterone acetate</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flutamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flutamide</a> for nine months, the Ferriman-Gallwey scores decreased by 28, 33, and 47 percent in the three groups, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gnrh-agonists-in-the-treatment-of-hyperandrogenism-and-hirsutism/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>When GnRH agonist therapy is started in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, there is a transient increase in gonadotropin and therefore in estrogen secretion, which can cause bloating and breast tenderness. Thus, the initiation of estrogen replacement should be <strong>delayed</strong> until the woman begins to have hot flashes, or for six to eight weeks, whichever is sooner. Avoidance of the gonadotropin flare and transient elevation of estrogen may be achieved with administration of GnRH agonist in the mid-luteal phase of the menstrual cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gnrh-agonists-in-the-treatment-of-hyperandrogenism-and-hirsutism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The addition of estrogen (add-back therapy) in any form ameliorates or prevents hot flushes and vaginal dryness in women treated with a GnRH agonist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58788\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58788 \">table 1</a>). It also minimizes bone loss. Those women treated with a GnRH agonist and an oral contraceptive had no loss of bone density in two reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gnrh-agonists-in-the-treatment-of-hyperandrogenism-and-hirsutism/abstract/12,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,17</a>], while in other studies women given a GnRH agonist and low-dose estrogen lost less bone than women given the agonist alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gnrh-agonists-in-the-treatment-of-hyperandrogenism-and-hirsutism/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY OF GnRH AGONISTS IN SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and hyperthecosis presents some separate challenges.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Polycystic ovary syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PCOS is a prime example of gonadotropin-dependent hyperandrogenism, and these women should be ideal candidates for GnRH agonist therapy. However, several factors need to be considered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some women with PCOS have a small increase in adrenal androgen production (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60049\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60049 \">table 2</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=steroid-hormone-metabolism-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Steroid hormone metabolism in polycystic ovary syndrome&quot;</a>). GnRH agonist therapy does not reduce adrenal androgen secretion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depending upon the severity of hair growth, some women may not achieve their desired cosmetic goal. There are ethnic and familial traits that may render a woman more likely to develop hirsutism and less likely to have a satisfactory response to any reduction in serum androgen concentrations. As an example, women of Middle Eastern extraction tend to have more facial and body hair.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with PCOS are often obese, and complete suppression of ovarian steroidogenesis during GnRH agonist therapy may not be achieved due to an inadequate dose relative to weight. This possibility is suggested by a lack of hypoestrogenic symptoms (eg, vasomotor instability or vaginal dryness) soon after the initiation of treatment and can be confirmed by measurement of serum estradiol. If the concentration is not low, then the dose of GnRH agonist should be increased.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovarian hyperthecosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This uncommon condition of young women represents an extremely severe form of ovarian hyperandrogenism. These women characteristically have not only marked hirsutism and menstrual irregularity, but also some virilization. Most also have marked hyperinsulinemia, which probably contributes substantially to their excess androgen production. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-hyperthecosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian hyperthecosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are few reported studies of GnRH agonist therapy in women with hyperthecosis. In one woman, daily GnRH agonist administration for six months nearly completely inhibited ovarian steroid production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gnrh-agonists-in-the-treatment-of-hyperandrogenism-and-hirsutism/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], but her hirsutism changed little, probably because it was long-standing and severe. GnRH should be effective in these women, and its use should always be considered because the only other available treatment of any efficacy is oophorectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-hyperthecosis#H14632546\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian hyperthecosis&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Hyperthecosis in postmenopausal women represents a different challenge. These women develop stromal hyperplasia because of the increase in gonadotropin secretion induced by ovarian senescence. In addition, the ovaries are usually enlarged. Most of these women are treated by oophorectomy because of the possibility of ovarian tumor.
