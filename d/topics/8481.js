The major complication of an elevated TB level (hyperbilirubinemia) is bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND), which occurs when circulating bilirubin crosses the blood-brain barrier, binds to brain tissue, and can cause a spectrum of neurologic sequelae.</p><p>Therapeutic interventions (ie, phototherapy and exchange transfusion) reduce TB levels in the blood and prevent BIND and, hence, kernicterus. In infants at or greater than 35 weeks GA (ie, term and late preterm infants), universally-accepted guidelines based upon an age-specific, percentile-based TB nomogram are used when deciding when to initiate phototherapy and exchange transfusions to prevent severe hyperbilirubinemia and BIND [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-preterm-infant-less-than-35-weeks-gestation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Lack of an evidence-based consensus on the management of hyperbilirubinemia in the preterm infant is due to variabilities in the clinical manifestations and spectrum of BIND, absence of reliable and predictive measures of bilirubin neurotoxicity, and uncertainties of the relative risks and benefits of interventions to reduce TB levels (ie, phototherapy and exchange transfusions), particularly in the extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infant (birth weight [BW] &le;1000 g).</p><p>Hyperbilirubinemia in the preterm infant &lt;35 weeks GA will be reviewed here. The diagnosis, evaluation, and management of hyperbilirubinemia in the late preterm and term infant are discussed separately.

A retrospective study reported a 4 percent rate of kernicterus based upon characteristic postmortem neuropathological findings (ie, bilirubin staining and neuronal necrosis) in 81 preterm infants (gestational age [GA] &lt;34 weeks) who died after 48 hours of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-preterm-infant-less-than-35-weeks-gestation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Although there have been small case series of survivors with neurologic sequelae associated with hyperbilirubinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-preterm-infant-less-than-35-weeks-gestation/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>], there are no data on the prevalence of kernicterus in preterm survivors. Determining the prevalence rate is limited by the variability in the spectrum of bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND) in preterm infants as well as in the presence of comorbidities (eg, sepsis, periventricular leukomalacia [PVL], and intraventricular hemorrhage [IVH]), and delayed manifestations of hypertonicity. For example, dystonic posture and abnormal muscle tone may not manifest until six months corrected age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-preterm-infant-less-than-35-weeks-gestation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Since the late 1970s, the incidence of kernicterus in preterm infants has declined to the point where kernicterus is rarely seen postmortem, and significant neurologic sequelae (eg, choreoathetoid cerebral palsy [CP], sensorineural hearing losses [SNHL]) due to hyperbilirubinemia have not emerged as clinically significant issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-preterm-infant-less-than-35-weeks-gestation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

As an example, the incidence of kernicterus fell from 31 to 0 percent in one neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) when the use of bacteriostatic saline containing benzyl alcohol to flush intravenous (IV) lines was discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-preterm-infant-less-than-35-weeks-gestation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperbilirubinemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of hyperbilirubinemia in the preterm infant is similar to that in the term infant.

Unconjugated bilirubin, which is not bound to albumin (also referred to as &quot;free&quot; or &quot;unbound bilirubin&quot; [UB]), enters the brain and causes cell death by apoptosis (programmed cell death) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> necrosis resulting in BIND.

Thus, the reported accuracy ranges limit their use since intervention thresholds have narrower ranges and are also guided by GA and are impacted by bilirubin-albumin binding. Devices with improved accuracy, better precision, and adjustments to bilirubin-albumin binding are needed if routine TcB screening is to be beneficial in preterm infants.</p><p>As a result, based on the currently available information, we do <strong>not</strong> recommend the routine use of TcB devices for assessing hyperbilirubinemia in preterm infants.

However, it is generally believed that infants born &lt;35 weeks gestational age (GA) are at greater risk to develop bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND) than the more mature infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-preterm-infant-less-than-35-weeks-gestation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, kernicterus is a rare complication in preterm infants and may be due in part to the aggressive use of phototherapy. Follow-up studies, as noted above, also have failed to demonstrate an association between a specific threshold peak total <span class=\"nowrap\">serum/plasma</span> bilirubin (TB) level and adverse neurologic outcome. In addition, there is concern that phototherapy increases the risk of mortality in low BW infants (BW &le;2500 g) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-preterm-infant-less-than-35-weeks-gestation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In an effort to answer whether aggressive phototherapy is beneficial or harmful in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (BW &le;1000 g) with elevated TB levels, a randomized trial from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network (NRN) evaluated the outcome of 1974 ELBW infants who were randomly assigned to aggressive or conservative phototherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-preterm-infant-less-than-35-weeks-gestation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. At 12 to 36 hours of life (mean age approximately 24 hours), infants were stratified into two groups by BW (low BW: 501 to 750 g, and high BW: 751 to 1000 g) and then randomly assigned to receive either aggressive or conservative therapy during the first 14 days of life. Aggressive phototherapy was initiated and continued for 24 hours when TB &ge;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (86 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> for both BW groups, and the threshold was increased to TB &ge;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (120 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> for the high BW group during the second week. Conservative therapy was initiated and continued for 24 hours at higher levels of TB &ge;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (137 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> in the low BW group and &ge;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (171 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> in the high BW group. Irradiance levels were increased if the TB exceeded 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (222 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> and 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (257 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> in the low and high BW groups, respectively.

These concerns are supported by the findings of an earlier trial of an increased mortality rate in preterm infants who received phototherapy compared with controls who received no phototherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-preterm-infant-less-than-35-weeks-gestation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. These results indicate potential adverse effects of phototherapy in the most preterm infants, which may contribute to an increased risk of death. It is possible that phototherapy may result in photo-oxidative injury to cell membranes, to which the most immature infants would be the most susceptible because of the greater transmission of light through their thin, gelatinous skin. Another speculation relates to the possible antioxidant role of bilirubin. If bilirubin has an antioxidant role, its reduction due to early use of phototherapy in the first 24 hours of life could have a deleterious effect in the most immature infants, who are the most vulnerable to oxidant injury because of reduced natural antioxidants.</p><p>A subsequent report from the NICHD NRN trial assessed the effect of phototherapy exposure on death and NDI at 18 to 22 months corrected age for 1802 patients (91.4 percent of the original cohort), of whom 1607 received phototherapy treatment (PTx) and 195 did not (NoPTx) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-preterm-infant-less-than-35-weeks-gestation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The NoPTx group had a higher mean BW and GA, and rate of caesarean section, and was more likely to have mothers with a lower educational level. At 18 to 22 months corrected age, phototherapy during the birth hospitalization was not independently associated with the primary outcome of death or NDI, death alone, or NDI alone. In the subgroup of lower BW infants (501 to 750 g), mortality before discharge was lower in the PTx group; however, this result may have been biased due to early deaths in this group prior to meeting the criteria for phototherapy. Among the lower BW group, the NoPTx group had an increased risk of severe cognitive impairment (Bayley Scales Mental Development Index [MDI] score of &lt;50) compared with the PTx group (29 versus 12 percent). In contrast, in the larger BW group, there was no difference in NDI or mortality between the PTx and NoPTx groups.</p><p>In a second analysis that compared patients treated with aggressive phototherapy (n = 230) versus those treated with conservative phototherapy (n = 218) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-preterm-infant-less-than-35-weeks-gestation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], aggressive phototherapy in lower BW infants (501 to 750 g) was associated with increased mortality, but a reduction in NDI, including profound impairment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88254618\"><span class=\"h3\">Prophylactic phototherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of prophylactic phototherapy in preterm infants (defined as initiation of phototherapy soon after birth and within 36 hours of life) has been suggested to prevent hyperbilirubinemia.

An operational guideline based on the preterm infant's BW was developed using data from the 1974 NICHD NRN phototherapy trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-preterm-infant-less-than-35-weeks-gestation/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p>This operational guideline was used in the study design of the previously discussed NICHD NRN trial, in which the indication for exchange transfusion was defined as a TB that exceeded the threshold based upon BW despite increased irradiance.

Although there are a number of experience-based management approaches developed by experts in the field that are based upon TB stratified by birth weight (BW), we utilize the following TB thresholds based on GA in our practice (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>GA &lt;28 weeks &ndash; TB &gt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (86 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>GA 28 to 29 weeks &ndash; TB 6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (103 to 137 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>GA 30 to 31 weeks &ndash; TB 8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (137 to 171 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>GA 32 to 33 weeks &ndash; TB 10 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (171 to 205 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>GA &gt;34 weeks &ndash; TB 12 to 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (205 to 239 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In preterm infants &lt;35 weeks GA, we suggest that the use of exchange transfusion be reserved for patients who do not respond to intensive phototherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We consider exchange transfusion in any infant with neurologic signs suspicious of BIND, with TB that exceeds the ability of available phototherapy to effectively lower the TB level (eg, TB levels &gt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [86 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]</span> greater than the values used to initiate phototherapy), with failure of phototherapy, or in whom the clinical benefit of exchange transfusion exceeds its potential risks.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-preterm-infant-less-than-35-weeks-gestation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">American Academy of Pediatrics Subcommittee on Hyperbilirubinemia.
