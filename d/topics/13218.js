In addition, youth with bipolar disorder usually have recurrent episodes of major depression; however, depressive episodes are not necessary for making the diagnosis. Pediatric bipolar disorder severely affects normal development and psychosocial functioning, and increases the risk for behavioral, academic, social, and legal problems, as well as psychosis, substance abuse, and suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-clinical-manifestations-and-course-of-illness/abstract/1,2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5</a>]. </p><p>Multiple retrospective studies have reported that in up to 60 percent of adults with bipolar disorder, onset of mood symptoms occurred before age 20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-clinical-manifestations-and-course-of-illness/abstract/1,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6-8</a>]. However, pediatric bipolar disorder is often not recognized, and many youth with the disorder do not receive treatment or are treated for comorbid conditions rather than bipolar disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-clinical-manifestations-and-course-of-illness/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A retrospective study of 88 pediatric patients with bipolar disorder found that the duration of untreated bipolar disorder, from onset of the first mood episode to first mental health contact, was nearly two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-clinical-manifestations-and-course-of-illness/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

As an example, the level of irritability and sleep disturbance in pediatric cyclothymic disorder each appear to be comparable to that for pediatric bipolar I disorder. In addition, youth with cyclothymic disorder typically have psychiatric comorbidity (eg, anxiety disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), and the frequency of comorbidity is comparable to that for youth with bipolar I disorder.

Symptoms are often vaguer and shorter lived in children than adolescents, and children have more difficulties expressing their symptoms. As a consequence, symptoms in children are more difficult to ascertain and differentiate from symptoms of other psychiatric disorders or normal behaviors. Symptoms in adolescents, in both <span class=\"nowrap\">manic/hypomanic</span> and depressive phases, are more similar to those seen in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-clinical-manifestations-and-course-of-illness/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

During episodes of mania, youth can present with elation (euphoria) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> irritability, increased energy, grandiose ideation or delusions, rapid to disorganized thinking, rapid (pressured) speech, distractibility, decreased need for sleep (eg, sleeping a few hours or awake all night and the next day without fatigue), and hypersexuality, as well as increased activity, agitation, impulsivity, and risky behaviors. Some investigators have argued that mania in children is mainly manifested with chronic symptoms of severe irritability, even if the irritability does not occur episodically. However, mania rarely occurs without elation; chronic (non-episodic) irritability is usually associated with other disorders (eg, oppositional defiant disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), rather than bipolar disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-clinical-manifestations-and-course-of-illness/abstract/1,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22,23</a>]. </p><p>A meta-analysis of 20 observational studies evaluated the frequency of manic symptoms in youth with bipolar I disorder and other specified bipolar disorder (total n &gt;2000, average age 11 years) (see <a href=\"#H856499873\" class=\"local\">'Bipolar disorder subtypes'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-clinical-manifestations-and-course-of-illness/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The most common symptoms across both bipolar subtypes included increased energy, irritability, mood lability, distractibility, and goal directed activity (each occurred in approximately 75 percent of patients) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F111706\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111706 \">table 4</a>). By contrast, the least frequent symptoms were hypersexuality, hallucinations, and delusions (each occurred in roughly 25 to 30 percent). The most frequent symptoms that are specific for bipolar disorder were grandiosity (57 percent) and hypersexuality (32 percent). For each symptom, the prevalence was greater in youth with bipolar I disorder than those with bipolar not otherwise specified; although the differences were not statistically significant, in nearly all instances the difference was clinically significant. The results of the meta-analysis need to be taken with caution because there were methodologic limitations (eg, studies varied in how they diagnosed bipolar disorder), which led to substantial heterogeneity across studies in the rates of most symptoms. &#160;</p><p>Manic symptoms are more severe than what is expected in a given environment for the child&rsquo;s developmental age. The symptoms cluster in episodes in that they have their onset or intensify with the abnormal mood and increased energy. Manic symptoms, especially increased activity, agitation, irritability, distractibility, and talkativeness, are distinguished from overlapping symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder by clearly worsening during the episode of mania.</p><p>Symptoms of mania in youth need to be distinguished from normal behavior. For symptoms of grandiosity, elation, and increase in goal activity, the line between normal and psychopathology, particularly in young children, can be challenging. Diagnosis is relatively easy if symptoms are extreme, recurrent, out of proportion for context and culture, and significantly affect the functioning of the child, but many cases are more difficult. </p><p>The diagnosis of pediatric mania (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91106\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91106 \">table 1</a>) is discussed separately.

Information about prodromal symptoms is discussed elsewhere in this topic, in the context of offspring of parents with bipolar disorder. (See <a href=\"#H2995284799\" class=\"local\">'Youth at high risk for bipolar disorder'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H577177368\"><span class=\"h3\">Elation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elation (euphoria) can be difficult to ascertain because children can normally be overly happy or silly, especially in situations such as a party or a visit to an amusement park [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-clinical-manifestations-and-course-of-illness/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. When elation is episodic, inappropriate for the context, and beyond what is expected for the age of the child, it may be a symptom of mania, particularly if other manic symptoms and impaired functioning are present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2520854\"><span class=\"h3\">Grandiosity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is normal for children to overestimate their abilities and believe they are the best at a particular sport, smarter than others, or will be very important. Some children, particularly those with oppositional defiant or conduct disorders, may believe that they are above needing to follow adult rules and requests. Manic grandiosity can be distinguished from these other presentations by representing a change from the child&rsquo;s usual behavior. Examples that raise suspicion that the grandiosity is pathological include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent and exaggerated thoughts that one is by far the best in an activity (eg, sports), despite clear evidence to the contrary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeatedly commanding teachers, parents, and coaches to do what one wants despite getting in trouble for this behavior.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thoughts that one has superpowers and acting upon these thoughts and doing things that most kids of the same age would not, even if they fantasize about them (eg, trying to fly from a tall tree).</p><p/><p>Grandiosity can manifest as either an overvalued idea (an unreasonable idea that the individual can acknowledge may not be true) or as a delusion (false, fixed belief that the individual insists is true despite obvious evidence to the contrary). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2520868\"><span class=\"h3\">Increased goal directed activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To be counted as a symptom of mania in children, increased goal directed activity has to be exaggerated, represent a change in functioning, and be recognized by others as excessive given the developmental age of the child. Diagnosis can be more difficult in younger children than in adolescents or adults. Examples of potentially manic behavior include situations when the child:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has uncharacteristically extended periods of driven creative activity such as drawing, painting, writing, or building things.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Takes on many tasks simultaneously (eg, school work while playing video games, watching television, and communicating with friends).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is driven to rearrange and redecorate <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> room, or to spontaneously complete many household chores well beyond expectations, particularly if the child typically does not engage in these activities or performs them at unusual times such as late at night.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2520875\"><span class=\"h3\">Increased sexual activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To be counted as a manic symptom, increased sexual activity needs to be inappropriate for the age of the child and not accounted for mainly by a history of sexual abuse or by exposure to others&rsquo; sexual activity. For children, this can manifest as preoccupation with viewing or drawing naked people; provocative touching of the breasts, genital area, or buttocks of others; or sexually explicit dancing. The frequency, intensity, and temporal association between these activities and elevated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> irritable mood are key factors when assessing potential hypersexual behavior. Mild expressions of these behaviors may be normal if they are transient and do not impair functioning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6530620\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypomania</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of hypomania (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91107\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91107 \">table 2</a>) are similar to the ones described for mania, but of lesser intensity and severity. As an example, the youth may become more talkative, sleep less, be more intrusive and outgoing, and be unable to still in class. In some instances, hypomania may improve functioning, such that the youth becomes more creative and &ldquo;sharper,&rdquo; and finishes school assignments faster and more accurately. Symptoms of hypomania may be difficult to differentiate from normal adolescent mood and behaviors and require careful longitudinal evaluation.</p><p>The diagnosis of pediatric hypomania (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91107\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91107 \">table 2</a>) is discussed separately.

Bipolar disorder in adolescents typically starts with a depressive syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-clinical-manifestations-and-course-of-illness/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Most depressed youth seen at psychiatric clinics are experiencing their first episode of major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-clinical-manifestations-and-course-of-illness/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although some of these youth may develop bipolar disorder, it is not possible to know at the time of first assessment who will go on to develop bipolar disorder. Thus, all patients who initially present with depressive syndromes should be assessed for a history of syndromal and subsyndromal manic or hypomanic symptoms. The presence of psychosis, family history of bipolar disorder, psychiatric comorbidity (eg, anxiety disorders and substance use disorders), and pharmacologically induced <span class=\"nowrap\">mania/hypomania</span> may indicate susceptibility to develop bipolar disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-clinical-manifestations-and-course-of-illness/abstract/1,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,28</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2995284799\" class=\"local\">'Youth at high risk for bipolar disorder'</a> below.) </p><p>The symptoms of major depression are above and beyond of what it is expected in a given environment for the child&rsquo;s developmental age. In addition, they cluster concurrently in episodes. If the child has other comorbid disorders with symptoms that overlap with major depression (eg, irritability due to oppositional defiant disorder and generalized anxiety disorder or poor concentration due to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), these symptoms need to worsen during the episode of major depression. &#160; &#160;</p><p>In contrast to mania, there is an overall decrease in emotion, cognition, and energy during an episode of depression. Depression is manifested by persistent sadness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> irritability, diminished ability to enjoy (anhedonia), lack of motivation, isolation, fatigue, low activity, poor concentration, hopelessness, negative thoughts, and suicidal ideation or attempts. </p><p>Children develop the cognitive maturity to describe emotions, thoughts, and behaviors as they age; thus, the younger the child, the more difficult it is to ascertain the symptoms of major depression (and <span class=\"nowrap\">manic/hypomanic</span> symptoms) and differentiate them from other disorders. As an example, the intent to commit suicide can be disguised because children may choose methods that in reality are not lethal such as holding their breath or putting their head under water in the bathtub. Younger children may not report feeling depressed, but only irritable or bored. &#160;</p><p>The combination of depressive symptoms and difficulty expressing their mood may make children more susceptible to have behavior problems, such as rebelling against parents and teachers (eg, not doing homework), having low frustration tolerance, and frequent temper outbursts. These behaviors may be misinterpreted as oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder and the symptoms of depression overlooked. &#160;</p><p>Children tend not to have as many &ldquo;melancholic&rdquo; symptoms (eg, anhedonia, lack of motivation, tiredness, lack of appetite, and insomnia) as depressed adolescents or adults. In addition, children may still be active in sports and music, but do not enjoy these activities as much, or continue to do well at school, but take longer to do their homework when depressed. Adolescents may tend to have more hypersomnia than insomnia, and increased appetite than lack of appetite.

Symptoms of bipolar disorder in adolescents, in both <span class=\"nowrap\">manic/hypomanic</span> and depressive phases, are more similar to those seen in adults. (See <a href=\"#H1520508615\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Episodes of bipolar mania, hypomania, and major depression can be accompanied by symptoms of the opposite polarity; these episodes are referred to as mood episodes with mixed features.

Although most patients recover from their mood episodes, periods of euthymia are relatively short and the disorder typically manifests with persistent fluctuating syndromal and subsyndromal symptomatology, particularly mixed and depressive symptoms. However, a substantial proportion of patients may experience prolonged periods without mood symptoms. Early age of onset, long duration of bipolar disorder, low socioeconomic status, mixed or rapid cycling episodes, psychosis, subsyndromal symptoms, comorbid disorders, exposure to negative life events, and family psychopathology are associated with worse course and outcome.

Onset of bipolar disorder in these high risk youth is often preceded by prodromal symptoms that include subsyndromal <span class=\"nowrap\">manic/hypomanic</span> symptoms, mood lability, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Other antecedent symptoms can include irritability and problematic behavior and sleep.
