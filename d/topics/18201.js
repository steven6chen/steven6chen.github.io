The TNM system combines features of the tumor into disease stage groups that correlate with survival and are linked to recommendations for treatment. Despite the evolving staging system, the links between stage and treatment have become weaker, given that older studies of stage-specific treatments were performed at a time that predated the staging techniques and treatments of modern clinical practice.</p><p>The purpose of TNM staging is to provide a description of the anatomic extent of cancer that can be easily communicated to others, assist in treatment decisions, and serve as an indicator of prognosis. It allows a way to compare cases, particularly in regards to the outcomes associated with different therapeutic options. In clinical practice, TNM stage is combined with the unique clinical characteristics of the patient and, in some cases, the molecular features of the tumor itself to guide prognostic assessment and treatment selections.</p><p>The eighth edition of the TNM staging system and the evidence supporting it are described in this topic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109806\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109806 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-for-lung-cancer/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

In general, SCLC tends to have a faster growth rate, more central and mediastinal localization, earlier metastasis to extrathoracic sites, and shorter overall survival time.</p><p>Small cell carcinoma is usually staged and managed using a simplified system of clinical limited or clinical extensive disease. The main role for TNM staging in SCLC is to improve the specificity of information contained in clinical cancer registries and clinical research. Analyses performed for the eighth edition of the TNM system confirm that the TNM system is applicable to small cell lung cancer and allows prognostication, with worsened survival for more advanced stages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-for-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Comparison with seventh edition staging is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109806\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109806 \">table 2</a>). This database was composed of data from diverse sources (90,041 patients) and cases from an electronic data capture system developed by Cancer Research And Biostatistics (CRAB, 4667 patients). Data from 70,967 patients with NSCLC were used to retrospectively validate the prognostic value of the TNM descriptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-for-lung-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>As with previous editions, the current edition of the TNM staging system categorizes tumors on the basis of primary tumor characteristics (T), the presence or absence of regional lymph node involvement (N), and the presence or absence of distant metastases (M). Molecular tumor features of lung cancer are not included in the TNM system. The overall stage of the tumor (stage I through IV) is determined by the combination of T, N, and M descriptors. The suffix &quot;X&quot; is attached (eg, TX, NX, or MX) if the extent of disease cannot be assessed for any of these features. The same TNM staging system is used to determine the clinical-diagnostic stage, surgical-pathologic stage, retreatment stage, and autopsy stage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3060885877\"><span class=\"h2\">Differences between eighth and seventh editions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Revisions to the seventh edition were made in order to improve the prognostic ability of the staging categories and cutoff points.

The five-year survival rates according to the cN and pN status were 60 and 75 percent (N0), 37 and 49 percent (N1), 23 and 36 percent (N2), and 9 and 20 percent (N3), respectively. The differences between nodal categories were all significant.</p><p>For pathologic staging, additional analyses revealed separation in survival based on the number of unique lymph nodes involved in N1 and N2 stations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-for-lung-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], leading to the new subdivisions proposed in the eighth edition. The presence of a &quot;skip&quot; metastasis, in which a single focus of N2 disease is present without N1 disease (pN2a1), was associated with an improved survival compared with disease in which both an N2 focus and an N1 focus were present (N2a2). No statistically significant differences in survival were observed for those with pN1b and pN2a disease, both of which had five-year survival rates of approximately 50 percent. Because these new subclassifications of nodal metastasis were based on smaller numbers of patients from a limited number of institutions, it is proposed that these be routinely recorded and considered for inclusion in future staging paradigm revisions. These nodal designations by themselves do not determine treatment options, but rather should be considered together with patient-specific factors in clinical decision-making.</p><p>As in previous staging systems, regional lymph nodes are divided into stations by laterality (right versus left) and location. Lymph node stations are designated by numbers 1 through 14 according to an internationally accepted schema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73945\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73945 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-for-lung-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2633591036\"><span class=\"h3\">Metastasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the eighth edition of the TNM staging system, metastatic disease continues to be classified as M1a if it is limited to the chest (cases with <span class=\"nowrap\">pleural/pericardial</span> effusions, contralateral lung or pleural nodules, or a combination of these factors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-for-lung-cancer/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. If not confined to the chest, there is now a new category, M1b, designating a single extrathoracic metastasis, which is distinguished from M1c, in which there are multiple metastatic lesions (in one or multiple organs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 1</a>). These changes led to the designation of stage IVA disease, in which disease is limited to either intrathoracic metastatic involvement or a single extrathoracic metastasis, versus stage IVB disease, in which multiple extrathoracic metastases exist. It is intended that this degree of precision will ultimately help guide treatment options for oligometastatic disease.</p><p>These changes were based on overall survival results from 1059 cases of metastatic NSCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-for-lung-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In this analysis, patients with M1a and M1b disease had similar survival, which differed from that of patients with M1c disease (11.5 months, 95% CI 10 to 13.8 months; 11.4 months, 95% CI 9.6 to 13.7 months; and 6.3 months, 95% CI 4.8 to 7 months, respectively) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110568\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110568 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3660790764\"><span class=\"h3\">Changes to the stage groupings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Changes made in the eighth edition TNM categories have resulted in alterations in assigned disease stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109806\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109806 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-for-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

For example, all T1N1 tumors are now stage IIB rather than IIA disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some situations, both of these influences apply. For example, tumors that are larger than 5 cm are now T3 rather than T2b, causing them to be grouped into higher stages, regardless of the N category.</p><p/><p>A new disease category stage IIIC has been created for patients with N3 disease and either a T3 or T4 primary lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-for-lung-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This new category reflects the poor prognosis of such cancers relative to stage IIIB cancers. Although the prognosis for stage IIIC disease is similar to stage IV disease, the distinction is made due to different treatment approaches available for locally advanced, nonmetastatic disease.
