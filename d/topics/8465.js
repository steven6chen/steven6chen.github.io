Despite this long experience, our understanding of the mechanism of action of hydroxyurea in SCD remains incomplete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydroxyurea-use-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2514106759\"><span class=\"h2\">Inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hydroxyurea</a> can bind metals. The primary cellular target of hydroxyurea is the ribonucleotide reductase enzymes, iron-containing enzymes that convert ribonucleoside diphosphates to deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), which are used in DNA synthesis and repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydroxyurea-use-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Ribonucleotide reductases use a free radical mechanism to catalyze the conversion to dNTPs, and hydroxyurea appears to block their function by binding the iron molecules and scavenging the free radicals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydroxyurea-use-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The lack of available dNTPs causes cells to arrest in S-phase of the cell cycle. Eventually, cells with stalled DNA replication forks will either delay S-phase until DNA synthesis can proceed, or they will undergo cell death.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hydroxyurea</a> has been shown to suppress other enzymes such as iron-sulfur cluster-containing enzymes (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-pathophysiology-of-the-sideroblastic-anemias#H3925656997\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and pathophysiology of the sideroblastic anemias&quot;, section on 'Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis'</a>), but it is not clear whether there is any physiologic effect in vivo.</p><p>Because <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> affects cell division, it causes global myelosuppression, including neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. (See <a href=\"#H3290537625\" class=\"local\">'Myelosuppression'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H543179326\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased HbF production</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hydroxyurea</a> causes a shift in gene expression at the beta globin locus, such that expression from the gamma globin locus is increased relative to that from the beta globin locus. This results in increased production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF; &alpha;<sub>2</sub>&gamma;<sub>2</sub>) and decreased production of adult hemoglobin (HbA; &alpha;<sub>2</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub>), the reverse of the normal fetal switch. Since the gamma globin chain is not affected by the sickle mutation, the overall effect in patients with SCD is to reduce the relative concentration of hemoglobin S (HbS; &alpha;<sub>2</sub>&beta;<sup>S</sup><sub>2</sub>).</p><p>HbF is the form of hemoglobin normally produced during fetal development and early infancy. HbF has other properties that differ slightly from normal adult hemoglobin (eg, slightly higher oxygen affinity), but it is well tolerated and causes no clinical problems. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hydroxyurea</a> causes HbF production to be increased at least twofold above baseline, often much more. The concentration of HbF per cell, the proportion of HbF-containing cells, and the overall percentage of HbF are all increased. The resultant decrease in the relative intracellular concentration of HbS leads to less hemoglobin polymerization and precipitation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sickle hemoglobin polymer: Structure and functional properties&quot;</a>). These effects reduce sickling. Red blood cell (RBC) lifespan is increased; RBC hydration is improved; hemolysis is reduced; and adhesion of cells to the vascular endothelium is lessened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydroxyurea-use-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. In turn, blood flow through the microcirculation improves and vaso-occlusive events are less likely to occur. This is thought to be the major mechanism by which hydroxyurea reduces vaso-occlusive events. In a prospective observational study of 230 children with SCD who were treated with hydroxyurea, a HbF percentage &gt;20 percent was associated with much lower rates of hospitalization, vaso-occlusive pain, acute chest syndrome, and fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydroxyurea-use-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Additional evidence to support the role of increased HbF in ameliorating SCD complications comes from observational studies of populations with naturally higher HbF levels and mouse models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydroxyurea-use-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. The role of HbF in these populations is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal hemoglobin (hemoglobin F) in health and disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The mechanism(s) by which <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> increases HbF production are incompletely understood and may include effects on epigenetic modification, gene transcription, and cell signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydroxyurea-use-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Increased nitric oxide (NO) levels and cyclic nucleotides such as guanylyl cyclase may induce HbF transcription via genes that regulate fetal hemoglobin transcription and translation, including BCL11A, a key regulator of baseline HbF levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydroxyurea-use-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Hydroxyurea may suppress expression of the small GTP binding protein SAR1 (<strong>s</strong>ecretion-<strong>a</strong>ssociated and <strong>r</strong>as-related signaling protein), which activates gamma globin expression through c-Jun N-terminal kinase <span class=\"nowrap\">(JNK/Jun)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydroxyurea-use-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Expression is increased from the G-gamma rather than the A-gamma gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydroxyurea-use-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These effects require a degree of active erythropoiesis, which may be suppressed by transfusion and possibly increased by erythropoietin. Alternative approaches to increasing HbF production via these pathways are under investigation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=investigational-therapies-for-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Investigational therapies for sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The changes in HbF and HbS production are first seen in reticulocytes. It may take up to three or more weeks to be seen in mature RBCs, and up to six months to affect clinical symptoms. The effects are completely reversible upon drug discontinuation, necessitating lifelong therapy in most cases.

Free hemoglobin, released during hemolysis, is a natural NO scavenger. Hydroxyurea reduces hemolysis and in turn may reduce free hemoglobin, allowing NO levels to be higher. Intracellularly, hydroxyurea leads to NO production in RBCs and endothelial cells via multiple mechanisms including direct NO generation by reacting with heme proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydroxyurea-use-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>]. NO is a potent vasodilator, and depletion in certain vascular beds could contribute to vaso-occlusion; increases in NO may improve blood flow in certain circulatory beds such as the pulmonary vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydroxyurea-use-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/17,23-26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,23-26,28</a>].

In vitro studies have shown that neutrophils from individuals with SCD have enhanced binding to fibronectin and increased activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydroxyurea-use-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

In contrast, an inverse relationship between HbF-containing cells and pain episodes was only seen during the first three months of the trial. Interpretation is difficult because the hydroxyurea dose was titrated to the neutrophil count.

A number of mechanisms may be involved, the most important of which is an increase in the level of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which reduces sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization, sickling, and vaso-occlusion.
