Their role, compared with other drugs, in the overall management of angina is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stable-ischemic-heart-disease-overview-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stable ischemic heart disease: Overview of care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcium influx into the myocyte initiates a series of events essential for contractility. Calcium entry into the myocyte first triggers intracellular calcium release; the released calcium then binds the regulatory protein troponin, resulting in a calcium-troponin complex which allows actin and myosin to interact and contract. The sequence of events is the same in vascular smooth muscle cells, except that a calcium-calmodulin complex instead of calcium-troponin permits the interaction between actin and myosin. The net effect is vasodilatation; the ensuing fall in blood pressure decreases cardiac work and may contribute to the efficacy of these drugs in the patient with angina.</p><p>Calcium channel blockers work by blocking the initial calcium influx into myocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, preventing the cascade of events detailed above. The available calcium channel blocking agents block receptors on the L-type calcium channel which gives rise to a slowly inactivating high threshold current in cardiac cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CARDIOVASCULAR AND ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The currently available calcium channel blockers may be categorized into four groups based upon different chemical structures:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dihydropyridines (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicardipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nicardipine</a>, nitrendipine, and others).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Verapamil</a>, which is structurally similar to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=papaverine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">papaverine</a>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Diltiazem</a>, a benzothiazepine derivative.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bepridil, a nonspecific calcium blocker that is infrequently used in the United States.</p><p/><p>These classes have varying mechanisms of action, leading to different effects on cardiovascular function and different types of side effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Dihydropyridines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dihydropyridines have the following actions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They block slow calcium channels in a dose-dependent fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They have a greater selectivity for vascular smooth muscle than for the myocardium, making them more potent vasodilators than either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They vasodilate coronary arteries, reduce coronary resistance, increase coronary blood flow, and may enhance the development of coronary collaterals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

Verapamil is effective in angina because it decreases myocardial oxygen demand by acting as a negative inotrope and chronotrope and by lowering the systemic blood pressure. Changes in contractility are minimal in patients without heart disease; however, verapamil can exacerbate heart failure in patients with cardiac dysfunction due to its negative inotropic activity. This effect is more pronounced in patients who are also treated with a beta blocker, a combination that is not generally used.

In the International Multicenter Angina Exercise (IMAGE) trial, 280 patients with chronic stable angina were randomized to six weeks therapy with long-acting preparations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> (20 mg BID) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> (200 mg once daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Nifedipine reduced the frequency of angina and increased the mean exercise time to 1-mm ST segment depression.

At five years, mortality was similar for nifedipine and placebo (1.64 versus 1.53 deaths per 100 patients per year). Nifedipine did significantly reduce the subsequent rates of coronary angiography and bypass surgery.

However, patients taking diltiazem reported twice as many adverse reactions than those on amlodipine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Felodipine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=felodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">felodipine</a> along with or instead of a beta blocker was evaluated in 363 patients with angina despite therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The addition of felodipine to metoprolol therapy increased the time to 1 mm ST segment depression and the time to angina during exercise testing and reduced the maximal ST segment depression. In contrast, the exercise test results after replacement of metoprolol with felodipine were not different from those observed during metoprolol therapy.</p><p>Given these data, the choice of a particular calcium channel blocker-beta blocker combination largely depends upon the clinical setting, the tolerance of side effects, and the severity of ischemic symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">ARE CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS SAFE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preceding findings as well as other studies suggested an adverse effect on cardiovascular disease in patients treated with short-acting dihydropyridines and high doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F51222\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51222 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. In particular, the marked hemodynamic perturbations of large doses of short-acting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> when given to such vulnerable patients appeared to increase mortality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F76385\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76385 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>These adverse hemodynamic effects are generally not seen when long-acting calcium channel blockers are given to patients with hypertension or stable angina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F52312\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52312 \">table 1</a>). The safety of long acting calcium channel blockers, when used for either blood pressure control or relief of angina, was evaluated in a meta-analysis of 15 studies including over 47,000 patients with coronary artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. There were no significant differences between the calcium channel blockers and other classes of agents (such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or beta blockers) or placebo in the rates of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or heart failure. A significant 21 percent relative reduction in the risk of stroke and, as expected, a significant reduction in the risk of angina were noted. No apparent difference was seen between dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine drugs.</p><p>The FDA has given the long acting and heart rate lowering calcium channel blockers a &quot;clean bill of health,&quot; while warning against short acting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].
