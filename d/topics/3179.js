The condition can be primary (ie, idiopathic CSA) or secondary. Secondary CSA can arise, for example, in association with Cheyne-Stokes breathing, a medical condition, a drug or substance, or high altitude periodic breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-sleep-apnea-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. CSA associated with Cheyne-Stokes breathing is particularly common, especially among patients who have heart failure or have had a stroke. It is characterized by central apneas that occur during the decrescendo portion of the cyclic crescendo-decrescendo respiratory pattern. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-sleep-disorders#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of sleep disorders&quot;, section on 'Sleep-related breathing disorders'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-disordered-breathing-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-disordered breathing in heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CSA can alternatively be categorized as hyperventilation- or hypoventilation-related. Hyperventilation-related CSA encompasses most of the types of CSA mentioned above; a notable exception is CSA associated with a drug or substance. Hypoventilation-related CSA occurs in disorders in which there is alveolar hypoventilation that is so severe that central apneas occur when the patient falls asleep because the wakefulness stimulus to breathe disappears. Central apneas tend to be a minor component of such disorders. Examples of contexts in which hypoventilation-related CSA may occur include central nervous system diseases, central nervous system suppressing drugs or substances, neuromuscular diseases, and severe abnormalities in pulmonary mechanics (eg, kyphoscoliosis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-sleep-apnea-pathogenesis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central sleep apnea: Pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Central apnea due to hyperventilation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-sleep-apnea-pathogenesis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central sleep apnea: Pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Central apnea due to hypoventilation'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical presentation and diagnosis of hyperventilation-related CSA are reviewed here. Hypoventilation-related CSA is not discussed here because central apneas tend to be a minor component of the underlying condition and, therefore, the presentation and diagnosis are dictated by the underlying condition. The pathogenesis and treatment of CSA are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-sleep-apnea-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central sleep apnea: Pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-sleep-apnea-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central sleep apnea: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H799740496\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CSA is common, although less prevalent in the general population than obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In a population-based study that included 5804 community-dwelling adults aged 40 years and older, the overall prevalence of CSA on polysomnography was 0.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-sleep-apnea-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Approximately half of the CSA cases were associated with Cheyne-Stokes breathing (0.4 percent overall). The median age of patients with CSA was 69 years. CSA was more common among patients with heart failure (4.8 percent) and in men compared with women (1.8 versus 0.2 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of symptomatic CSA (ie, CSA syndrome) appears to be higher among older adults, males, and those with certain comorbid medical conditions such as heart failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of CSA syndrome is greater among adults who are older than 65 years than among younger adults (1.1 versus 0.4 percent), according to an observational study of 741 randomly selected adults that defined CSA syndrome as a central apnea-hypopnea index &ge;10 events per hour plus symptoms or signs of disrupted sleep (eg, daytime sleepiness) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-sleep-apnea-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The study also found that 12 percent of the adults older than 65 years had &ge;2.5 central apneas per hour of sleep compared with only 1.7 percent of younger adults.</p><p>The increased prevalence of CSA syndrome among older adults may reflect the higher frequency of comorbid conditions that influence breathing during sleep among older adults, such as heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-sleep-apnea-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-sleep-apnea-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and cerebrovascular diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-sleep-apnea-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Alternatively, it may be due to the aging process itself or to sleep state oscillation precipitating central apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-sleep-apnea-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-sleep-apnea-pathogenesis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central sleep apnea: Pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Central apnea at sleep onset'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Sex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CSA syndrome is more prevalent among men than women. In one population-based sample, the prevalence of CSA syndrome was 0.4 percent among men and zero percent among women, while central apneas were detected in 7.8 percent of men and only 0.3 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-sleep-apnea-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Experimentally, the propensity for developing hypocapnic central apnea is greater in males compared with females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-sleep-apnea-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-sleep-apnea-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central sleep apnea: Pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The difference in CSA propensity between women and men may relate to the effects of both testosterone and estrogens on apneic threshold. Administration of testosterone to healthy premenopausal women for 12 days increases the apneic threshold during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-sleep-apnea-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], whereas suppression of testosterone with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a> acetate in healthy males decreases the apneic threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-sleep-apnea-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In a separate study, there was no difference in carbon dioxide reserve between men and postmenopausal women during NREM sleep, whereas administration of hormone replacement therapy to the women increased carbon dioxide reserve (reflecting lower susceptibility to central apnea) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-sleep-apnea-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both CSA associated with Cheyne-Stokes breathing, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are prevalent among patients with heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-sleep-apnea-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14-16</a>]. The former is particularly common among individuals with heart failure who are male, older than 60 years, have atrial fibrillation, or have daytime hypocapnia (PaCO<sub>2</sub> &lt;38 mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-sleep-apnea-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. CSA and OSA in patients with heart failure are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-disordered-breathing-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-disordered breathing in heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CSA is common after stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-sleep-apnea-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,18</a>]. This was illustrated by a prospective cohort study of 161 patients who had a stroke. Approximately 70 percent of patients developed sleep apnea (defined as an apnea-hypopnea index &gt;10 events per hour) within the initial 72 hours, including 26 percent with CSA in the context of Cheyne-Stokes breathing. Three months later, CSA was detected in only 7 percent of the patients, suggesting that CSA following acute stroke is often self-limited. There was no relationship between the location of the stroke and the likelihood of sleep apnea. The diagnosis and management of sleep apnea in patients with stroke is discussed in more detail elsewhere.

They may also report symptoms due to the recurrent central apneas with oxyhemoglobin desaturation, including paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, morning headaches, and nocturnal angina. These may be the presenting complaints, reported during the evaluation of another complaint, or detected during health maintenance screening. Alternatively, CSA may be first suspected when a hospitalized patient is being monitored and is noted to have episodic oxyhemoglobin desaturation, pauses in breathing, or nocturnal arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-disorders-in-hospitalized-adults-evaluation-and-management#H1727638264\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep disorders in hospitalized adults: Evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Central sleep apnea'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4409547\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive daytime sleepiness is a common feature of CSA. However, it may go unnoticed or its significance may be underestimated because of its insidious onset and chronicity. Therefore, careful questioning is essential to uncover subtle drowsiness in boring, passive, or monotonous situations, such as driving, watching television, and reading. Excessive daytime sleepiness may not be present and is not a required feature of CSA, as some patients complain instead of insomnia due to the repetitive awakenings. </p><p>In addition to daytime sleepiness, the clinician should ask about other symptoms of disrupted sleep, such as poor subjective sleep quality, fatigue, inattention, poor concentration, moodiness, decreased libido, and impotence. Patients may complain of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea due to the compensatory hyperpnea that follows a central apnea, or they may report morning headaches and nocturnal angina due to the episodic oxyhemoglobin desaturation. Bed partners may report apneic periods.</p><p>CSA is typically associated with another medical condition and, therefore, patients often report the symptoms of the coexisting condition. As an example, patients with CSA associated with Cheyne-Stokes breathing may report symptoms of heart failure, such as dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. When the CSA occurs in the context of Cheyne-Stokes breathing, the bed partner may report episodic hyperpnea, hypopnea, and apneic periods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4409554\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no physical findings that are specific for CSA. However, patients who have CSA associated with another condition typically have physical findings due to the associated condition. As examples, patients with CSA associated with Cheyne-Stokes breathing due to heart failure frequently have peripheral edema, crackles, an S3 gallop, jugular venous distension, or right upper quadrant pain due to hepatic congestion, while patients with CSA associated with stroke may have asymmetric weakness, sensory or cranial nerve abnormalities, or ataxia. Many patients with CSA have an irregularly irregular pulse due to atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-sleep-apnea-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4409758\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hospitalized patients who are being monitored may exhibit abnormalities due to CSA. Among the more common monitoring abnormalities are episodic apneic periods detected by a respiratory monitor, episodic oxyhemoglobin desaturation detected by continuous pulse oximetry, atrial fibrillation detected by telemetry while the patient is asleep or awake, and nocturnal arrhythmias detected by telemetry. While such monitoring data are not specific enough to confirm or exclude CSA, they warrant consideration of CSA, particularly when risk factors for CSA exist. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with daytime sleepiness plus risk factors for CSA (eg, heart failure, stroke, use of a long-acting opioid) or more than one symptom or sign of CSA (eg, daytime sleepiness, insomnia, morning headaches, nocturnal angina, witnessed pauses in breathing during sleep) should undergo full-night, attended, in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG). PSG is considered the gold standard diagnostic test for sleep-related breathing disorders. Ambulatory diagnosis and management, including home sleep apnea testing, have not been validated for the management of CSA. </p><p>During PSG, the patient is connected to a variety of monitoring devices. Physiologic variables are recorded digitally on a paperless computerized system while the patient sleeps and during any intervening wakefulness. Captured information includes sleep stages (via electroencephalography, electrooculography, submental electromyography), respiratory effort (usually via respiratory inductive plethysmography, sometimes with electromyography, strain gauges, piezo electrodes, or impedance devices), airflow (usually via a nasal pressure transducer and oronasal thermistor), oxyhemoglobin saturation (via continuous pulse oximetry), and heart rate and rhythm (via continuous electrocardiography). The sleeping room is usually equipped with an infrared camera and audio system that allows the technologist to see, hear, and communicate with the patient without entering the bedroom. Patterns of physiologic abnormalities during sleep are often diagnostic.

These obstructive events typically lead to awakenings, resulting in symptoms and signs of disrupted sleep. Among the disorders in the differential diagnosis of CSA, OSA is the most closely related because only CSA and OSA are characterized by symptoms and signs of episodic oxyhemoglobin desaturation (eg, morning headaches).

(See <a href=\"#H17199584\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CSA is uncommon in the general population; however, its prevalence is higher among older adults, males, and those with certain comorbid conditions, such as heart failure or stroke. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with CSA typically present with symptoms of disrupted sleep (eg, excessive daytime sleepiness, poor subjective sleep quality, insomnia, inattention, and poor concentration) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms due to recurrent central apneas with oxyhemoglobin desaturation (eg, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, morning headaches, and nocturnal angina). These may be the presenting complaints, reported during the evaluation of another complaint, or detected during health maintenance screening. Alternatively, CSA may be first suspected when a hospitalized patient is being monitored and is noted to have episodic oxyhemoglobin desaturation, pauses in breathing, or nocturnal arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"#H26263960\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with daytime sleepiness plus risk factors for CSA (eg, heart failure, stroke, chronic opioid therapy) or more than one symptom or sign of CSA (eg, daytime sleepiness, insomnia, morning headaches, nocturnal angina, witnessed pauses in breathing during sleep) should undergo full-night, attended, in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG). PSG is considered the gold standard diagnostic test for sleep-related breathing disorders. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic criteria for CSA vary according to the type of CSA. Generally speaking, diagnosis generally requires evidence of frequent central apneas via polysomnography, symptoms or signs of disrupted sleep, association with an underlying cause, and exclusion of alternative diagnoses. (See <a href=\"#H4409791\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of conditions must be considered in the differential diagnosis of CSA because they similarly cause excessive daytime sleepiness and other symptoms and signs of disrupted sleep. All of these conditions are distinguished by polysomnography. They include obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movements of sleep, shift work, narcolepsy, and respiratory disease. (See <a href=\"#H4409823\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">American Academy of Sleep Medicine.
