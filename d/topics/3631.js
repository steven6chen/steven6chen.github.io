They can present in childhood as congenital lesions or acquired disorders which by adulthood are quite common. Vein-related problems may or may not be symptomatic and include a wide range of clinical signs varying from minimal superficial venous dilation to edema <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic skin changes with ulceration and even so-called venous claudication.</p><p>An overview of the Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification of lower extremity chronic venous disorders will be presented here.

Lower extremity swelling due to lymphedema is often confused with that due to venous origin. Venous edema usually occurs at the ankle, and may extend to the leg but less commonly extends to the foot and toes, distinguishing it from lymphedema. The evaluation and management of lymphedema is discussed separately.

It usually occurs in the ankle region but may extend to the more proximal leg or to the foot.</p><p>Eczema is an erythematous dermatitis, which may progress to blistering, weeping, or scaling eruption of skin of the leg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F51553\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51553 \">picture 4</a>). It is often located near varicose veins but the presence of varicosities is not required for eczema of venous origin, and venous eczema may be located anywhere on the leg below the knee.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Lipodermatosclerosis (C4b)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lipodermatosclerosis (LDS) is localized chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the skin and subcutaneous tissues of the lower leg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F65447\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65447 \">picture 5</a>), sometimes associated with scarring or contracture of the Achilles tendon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F76901\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76901 \">picture 6</a>). It is sometimes preceded by diffuse inflammatory edema of the skin which may be painful and which is often referred to as hypodermatitis. The differential diagnosis includes: lymphangitis, erysipelas, or cellulitis.</p><p>Atrophie blanche (white atrophy) is a localized, circular or stellate ivory colored depressed region of abnormal skin surrounded by dilated capillaries and sometimes hyperpigmentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67105\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67105 \">picture 7</a>).

Veins that traverse between the same system (superficial to superficial or deep to deep) are termed communicating veins, whereas veins that connect the superficial to the deep system are called perforating veins. The nomenclature of the venous anatomy of the lower extremity is standardized to eliminate confusing terminology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disorders/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Eighteen named venous segments are used as locators of pathology and classified anatomically as superficial veins (As), deep veins (Ad), perforating veins (Ap) or venous location not specified (An) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F77469\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77469 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Superficial venous system (As)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The superficial veins are contained in the subcutaneous tissue of the lower extremity within a superficial space that is bounded deeply by the muscular fascia and superficially by the dermis. The major axial superficial veins of the lower extremity include the great and small saphenous veins. Other lower extremity superficial veins with more variant anatomy include the anterior, posterior and superficial accessories of the great saphenous vein, the superficial accessory of the small saphenous vein, intersaphenous veins (communicating veins between the great and small saphenous veins) and the lateral venous system.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The great saphenous vein originates from the dorsal venous network of the foot and courses medially in the lower leg and thigh (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55019\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55019 \">figure 1</a>). It drains into the common femoral vein at the confluence of the superficial inguinal veins at the saphenofemoral junction. The anatomy of the saphenofemoral junction is highly variable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F113245\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113245 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disorders/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The great saphenous vein also drains into the deep venous system through both calf and thigh perforating veins. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The small saphenous vein originates from the lateral foot and courses posteriorly along the midline of the calf overlying the fascia between the heads of the gastrocnemius muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52340\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52340 \">figure 3</a>). It usually joins the deep system at the level of the popliteal veins as the saphenopopliteal junction. The anatomy of the proximal small saphenous vein is, however, highly variable and it may join the femoral vein in the thigh or it may be a tributary of the great saphenous vein. A cranial extension of the small saphenous vein may course up the posterior thigh.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The accessory saphenous veins can become more prominent after saphenous ablation procedures and are a potential source of recurrent varicose veins.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Perforating veins (Ap)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perforating veins are those veins that traverse the muscular fascia to connect superficial veins with deep veins.

The deep veins of the lower extremity are classified as intramuscular (within the muscle) or intermuscular (between muscle groups). The intermuscular veins are more important in the development of chronic venous disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leg &ndash; The intermuscular veins of the leg include the popliteal veins and crural veins (paired anterior tibial, posterior tibial and peroneal veins) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75219 \">figure 4</a>). The intramuscular veins include the gastrocnemius and soleal sinus veins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The three paired crural veins are named after the artery they accompany. The posterior tibial veins originate from the medial foot at the medial malleolus, the anterior tibial veins from the dorsum of the foot, and the peroneal veins from venous collaterals originating between the distal tibia and fibula. The popliteal vein originates in the popliteal space as the confluence of the crural veins. The popliteal veins transition to be renamed the femoral vein at the level of the adductor canal in the thigh. Duplication of the femoral vein in the thigh is a well-recognized anatomic variant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thigh &ndash; The intermuscular veins of the thigh include the femoral vein, deep femoral vein and common femoral vein. The femoral vein is joined just below the saphenofemoral junction by the deep femoral vein to form the common femoral vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75219 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvis &ndash; The pelvic veins draining blood away from the lower extremities can, when narrowed or thrombosed, contribute significantly to the development of chronic venous disease. The main collecting veins of the pelvis include the external iliac veins, internal iliac veins, and common iliac veins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After passing beneath the inguinal ligament, the common femoral vein becomes the external iliac vein, which is joined by the internal iliac veins to form the common iliac veins. The common iliac veins merge at the level of the umbilicus to form the inferior vena cava. Because the inferior vena cava is usually located to the right of the spine, the left common iliac vein is longer with a less vertical path to the cava (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75219 \">figure 4</a>). The left common iliac vein is crossed anteriorly by the right common iliac artery and this results in variable degrees of compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery. When associated with left lower extremity edema or iliac vein thrombosis, this is referred to as May-Thurner syndrome. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Anatomy not specified (An)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In clinical studies, if an anatomic location is not identified, An is assigned.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiology (The &quot;P&quot; component of CEAP)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiologic element of the CEAP classification designates the presence or absence of venous reflux <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> obstruction.</p><p>In the upright position, the effects of gravity must be overcome for blood from the lower extremities to return to the heart. The venous valves and &quot;venous pump&quot; (effect of leg muscle contraction on venous flow) are the two major determinants of lower extremity venous flow when subjects are upright [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disorders/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Blood is directed from the superficial system (draining the skin and subcutaneous tissues) to the deep venous system by muscular contractions and prevented from flowing in the opposite direction by passive closure of one-way venous valves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Venous reflux (Pr)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital valvular abnormalities or damage to the vein valves from trauma or prior venous thrombosis may result in varying degrees of retrograde flow (abnormal is defined as &gt;0.5 seconds of reverse flow detected by duplex scanning) in the venous system termed reflux. Reflux may be present in isolated segments or throughout the entire course of the superficial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deep venous systems. Deep venous reflux is generally associated with the most severe clinical symptoms and signs, but ulceration is also possible with superficial venous reflux alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Several classification systems are used to categorize these disorders and determine disease severity for the purpose of providing an accurate record of the patient's disease status, facilitating communication between practitioners, and serving as a basis for standardized reporting. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) criteria, developed by international consensus, classifies lower extremity venous disease based upon clinical signs, etiology, anatomic location, and pathophysiologic abnormality. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'CEAP classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measures of lower extremity venous clinical severity augment the CEAP criteria and assign point values to various clinical, anatomic, activity, and lifestyle-related parameters. Higher scores indicate more severe debilitation due to chronic venous disease. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Measures of clinical severity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Villalta scale is a clinical scale used to identify patients who have developed post-thrombotic syndrome following lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and to grade the severity of the post-thrombotic syndrome.
