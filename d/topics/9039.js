In some circumstances, however, other tests, such as insulin-induced hypoglycemia, are utilized to evaluate the response to stress, particularly when ACTH deficiency is suspected as the cause. This stress test also is used to establish a diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency. It has been used in patients with suspected Cushing's syndrome, but is not recommended as a diagnostic test in this setting.</p><p>Details of the insulin-induced hypoglycemia test in adults will be reviewed here. Additional information on the diagnoses of adrenal insufficiency, growth hormone deficiency, and Cushing's syndrome in adults is reviewed separately.

However, hypoglycemia causes a major stress response, with increases in plasma corticotropin (ACTH) and serum cortisol, growth hormone, and prolactin, and activation of the sympathetic nervous system. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic response to hypoglycemia in normal subjects and patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1824015\"><span class=\"h2\">Advantages/disadvantages</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a stress test, insulin-induced hypoglycemia has certain advantages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>This test evaluates the integrity of the full hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as hypoglycemia acts centrally to stimulate hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) release and, therefore, ACTH release</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The degree of hypoglycemia can easily be quantified</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The test is safe, if a clinician is present, in patients with no history of seizures or cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hypoglycemia can be corrected within seconds by intravenous infusion of glucose</p><p/><p>However, compared with other tests for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, it is more difficult to perform, has some risk, and is more expensive. As a result, it is rarely performed in clinical practice for the assessment of pituitary-adrenal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-induced-hypoglycemia-test/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The magnitude of the response depends upon the degree of hypoglycemia. Criteria (ie, rate and degree of fall in serum glucose) that are adequate to elicit a maximal serum growth hormone response are inadequate to ensure a maximal plasma ACTH response. Thus, since the purpose of the test is to increase ACTH release, more stringent criteria of adequate hypoglycemia must be applied.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H727077\"><span class=\"h2\">Suggested use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although insulin-induced hypoglycemia is a valid and perhaps the most rational test of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal response to stress, in most settings the one-hour <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ACTH stimulation test</a> provides nearly the same information, is less difficult and expensive to perform, and is without risk to the patient (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the response to ACTH in adrenal insufficiency&quot;</a>). Recent pituitary surgery is the main clinical scenario when the ACTH stimulation test may not be as useful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H621972649\"><span class=\"h3\">After pituitary surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If ACTH deficiency occurs as a result of transsphenoidal surgery, the cortisol response to exogenous ACTH stimulation may by normal until the adrenal glands atrophy. In this setting, insulin-induced hypoglycemia may be a better test to diagnose ACTH deficiency because the ACTH response to hypoglycemia may be lost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-induced-hypoglycemia-test/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This is suggested by the discrepancy in responses to both the 250 and 1 mcg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ACTH stimulation test</a> compared with insulin hypoglycemia. In one study of 19 patients after transsphenoidal surgery, 6 of 19 patients had an abnormal response to insulin within 11 days of surgery, but two of these had normal responses to the 1 mcg and five had normal response to the 250 mcg ACTH stimulation test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-induced-hypoglycemia-test/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In another study, at three to five weeks after surgery, six patients with an abnormal cortisol response to the 1 mcg ACTH stimulation test had normal responses to insulin, while three with normal responses to the 250 mcg test had an abnormal response to insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-induced-hypoglycemia-test/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A third study showed that 23 of 62 patients with initial normal responses to 250 mcg ACTH had an abnormal response when tested at one or three months. Based on this, it appears that ACTH stimulation tests are not an appropriate test for adrenal insufficiency in the immediate post-operative period, and that at one month after surgery the 250 mcg test may under-diagnose while the 1 mcg test may over-diagnose adrenal insufficiency.</p><p>However, an abnormal cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia test in the immediate post-operative period may not predict long-term dysfunction. In one study of 36 patients with an abnormal response to insulin at three months after surgery, 20 patients had a normal response at 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-induced-hypoglycemia-test/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In another, all six patients with an abnormal response to insulin in the immediate postoperative period had a normal response at three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-induced-hypoglycemia-test/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. By contrast, very few patients with an initially normal response to insulin or ACTH progress to an abnormal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-induced-hypoglycemia-test/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>The basal cortisol level after surgery may be a useful indicator of adrenal function. A morning value &gt;250 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L</span> (9 to 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL)</span> within eight days of surgery predicts a normal response to insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-induced-hypoglycemia-test/abstract/3,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7-9</a>]. Conversely, basal values of 80 to 111 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L</span> (3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL)</span> predict an abnormal response. Intermediate values may represent normal or abnormal function.</p><p>The preoperative assessment of adrenal function is also helpful, as patients with abnormal function are unlikely to regain function and should receive perioperative glucocorticoid coverage and post-operative replacement therapy. We suggest that patients receive perioperative glucocorticoid treatment with replacement doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> to avoid suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Patients with normal adrenal function before surgery should receive post-operative assessment, particularly if they undergo extensive exploration or resection. Because the basal morning serum cortisol can provide very useful information, we suggest that it be measured within eight days of surgery, before any glucocorticoid is administered that day. Values greater than 250 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L</span> suggest that the patient does not require glucocorticoid replacement, while indeterminate values or those less than 111 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L</span> suggest that glucocorticoid replacement is prudent until further testing is performed. More definitive testing at three months using ACTH or hypoglycemia to stimulate the axis is needed in these patients. Those who have a normal response to either agent are very unlikely to develop subsequent adrenal insufficiency, while those with an abnormal response to insulin may normalize over time and should receive further testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-testing-for-hypopituitarism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic testing for hypopituitarism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is important to recognize that specific recommended cut-off levels for cortisol are based on specific assays, and may vary among assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-induced-hypoglycemia-test/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Ideally, criteria for an abnormal response should be validated locally, or very conservative cut-off points should be used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient fasts for at least eight hours before the test and must remain supine during the procedure. A clinician must be present at all times. A syringe containing 50 percent glucose solution should be at the bedside. An intravenous line is established and insulin is injected intravenously. The usual dose is 0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/kg,</span> but different doses may be indicated in certain patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients thought to have hypopituitarism or primary adrenal insufficiency, the insulin dose is decreased to 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/kg</span> because these conditions may be associated with decreased release of other counterregulatory hormones such as epinephrine and growth hormone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with obesity, diabetes mellitus, suspected acromegaly or Cushing's syndrome, the dose is increased to 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/kg</span> because insulin resistance is likely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In premenopausal women, the test can be performed at any phase of the menstrual cycle, as there are no cycle effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-induced-hypoglycemia-test/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>Blood is obtained for bedside measurement of serum glucose, and for laboratory measurement of serum glucose and cortisol assays (and for growth hormone, if indicated) immediately before insulin is injected and every 15 minutes thereafter. The last sample is obtained when adequate hypoglycemia, defined as 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> or less, is achieved. At that time, patients should have some symptoms of hypoglycemia, either of sympathetic discharge or of central nervous system glucose deprivation, such as simply falling asleep.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Almost all patients have some degree of perspiration. If the patient does not perspire, the adequacy of the stress stimulus must remain suspect irrespective of the serum glucose concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients also have a hyperactive precordium (but not tachycardia or hypotension, because they are supine), and feelings of hunger, drowsiness, detachment, or anxiety. The last is common and sometimes severe, and many patients find this an unpleasant experience.</p><p/><p>Hypoglycemia usually occurs 30 to 45 minutes after insulin injection. If adequate hypoglycemia is not achieved, a second similar dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a> should be injected intravenously. Adequate hypoglycemia should be achieved within the ensuing 30 to 45 minutes.</p><p>Ideally, an automated glucose oxidase analyzer should be available at the bedside. Unfortunately, most glucose oxidase strips, whether read visually or with a glucose meter, are inaccurate at low serum glucose concentrations, tending to underestimate them, leading to premature termination of the test. The final, definitive blood sample for measurement of cortisol should be obtained 5 to 10 minutes after the patient begins to perspire or, if it can reliably be measured, when the serum glucose falls below 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Some have recommended a serum glucose nadir of 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> or less, which appears to be adequate in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-induced-hypoglycemia-test/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency or long-standing diabetes mellitus have an impaired compensatory response to hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic response to hypoglycemia in normal subjects and patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therefore, the test should be stopped when the serum glucose concentration falls to or below 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> by infusing 10 percent glucose solution in addition to giving sweetened orange juice or cola by mouth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 50 percent glucose solution should be infused over a period of one minute (slowly, because of its hypertonicity) if seizure, chest pain, confusion, disorientation, or other potentially serious complications occur; this will result in hyperglycemia within 30 seconds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood should be drawn for measurement of cortisol when glucose is given, and 15 minutes later, as levels continue to increase despite increasing serum glucose concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-induced-hypoglycemia-test/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p>The impact of glucose infusion on cortisol values was illustrated in a study of hypoglycemic symptoms in 16 healthy subjects who underwent two insulin tolerance tests. Each received 500 mL of a 5 percent glucose or a 0.9 percent saline solution in a randomized fashion when the blood glucose fell to less than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. The duration and severity of symptoms were reduced significantly by glucose infusion and peak cortisol levels were similar in the two tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-induced-hypoglycemia-test/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Although such an approach has not been validated in patients with adrenal insufficiency, it may be useful in patients with pituitary disease who may have diminished counter-regulatory responses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal values</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The criteria for a normal serum cortisol response ranged from 18 to about 22 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (500 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> in multiple studies using different assays and various methods to establish a normal reference range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-induced-hypoglycemia-test/abstract/6,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14</a>]. Ideally, reference ranges would be determined locally but this is rarely done in practice. If serum cortisol reaches this level, it is unimportant whether hypoglycemia was adequate. On the other hand, failure to reach this level is indicative of an inadequate response <strong>only</strong> if the serum glucose fell to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> or less. If this was not achieved, the stimulus was inadequate and the test must be repeated. It is the serum cortisol concentration that is achieved rather than the increment that is important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-induced-hypoglycemia-test/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The serum cortisol increase parallels that of plasma ACTH up to a serum cortisol concentration of about 22 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (607 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> corresponding to a plasma ACTH concentration of approximately 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (16 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L),</span> which is the acute maximally stimulating plasma concentration of ACTH.</p><p>Plasma ACTH can also be measured. The normal plasma ACTH response has not been carefully defined, but the peak concentration should exceed 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (33 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-induced-hypoglycemia-test/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>].</p><p>Serum growth hormone should also increase; its measurement provides another index of anterior pituitary function. Its use for the diagnosis of adult growth hormone deficiency is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth hormone deficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are only limited data regarding the salivary cortisol response to insulin hypoglycemia; this promising outcome measure requires further validation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-induced-hypoglycemia-test/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An inadequate cortisol response can be due to hypopituitarism of any etiology, including hypothalamic CRH deficiency, isolated ACTH deficiency, partial or panhypopituitarism, and acute or chronic administration of synthetic glucocorticoids; it can also be due to primary adrenal insufficiency when serum cortisol rather than plasma ACTH values are used as the end-points of the test. However, false negative results in patients who have partial adrenal insufficiency can occur because hypoglycemia is such a potent stimulus that it may obscure a partial defect.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoglycemia is a much stronger stimulus of ACTH secretion than is hypocortisolemia (as induced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a>). Consequently, patients may have a normal response to hypoglycemia, but an inadequate response to metyrapone, which can detect subtle defects in ACTH secretion. The reverse is almost never true.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The low-dose (1 mcg) one-hour <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ACTH stimulation test</a> does not result in maximally stimulating plasma ACTH concentrations. Thus, as with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a>, patients may have a normal serum cortisol response to hypoglycemia (or to the high-dose cosyntropin test), but an inadequate response to low-dose cosyntropin.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Previous use in Cushing's syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It was once claimed that the failure of the pituitary to respond to hypoglycemia with increased secretion of growth hormone and ACTH (as assessed by the serum cortisol concentration) was a unique feature of Cushing's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-induced-hypoglycemia-test/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, this lack of response is characteristic of chronic hypercortisolemia of any etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-induced-hypoglycemia-test/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].
