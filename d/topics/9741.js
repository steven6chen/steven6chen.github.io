Surface cells and foveolar cells line the upper portion of the gastric glands. Slightly deeper in the gland is the isthmus, which contains the mucous neck cells. The base of the oxyntic gland contains the specialized epithelium, which includes the enterochromaffin cell (serotonin), the enterochromaffin-like cell (histamine), the chief cell (pepsinogen), the D cell (somatostatin), and the parietal cell (acid and intrinsic factor).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPERPLASTIC GASTROPATHIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">M&eacute;n&eacute;trier's disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>M&eacute;n&eacute;trier's disease (also called protein-losing hypertrophic gastropathy) is a rare acquired condition of the stomach that is characterized by the following features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giant mucoidal folds in the gastric fundus and body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63252\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63252 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminished acid secretory capacity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A protein losing state with hypoalbuminemia</p><p/><p>This condition is most common in middle-aged males, but it occurs in both genders and in children as a special pediatric variant. The disease is usually progressive in adults. There are rare reports of spontaneous regression, but virtually none in patients with symptoms longer than six months' duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-gastric-folds-hyperplastic-and-nonhyperplastic-gastropathies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of M&eacute;n&eacute;trier's disease is not well understood. It is thought to involve increased signaling of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which results in proliferation of epithelial cells of the mucous cell compartment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-gastric-folds-hyperplastic-and-nonhyperplastic-gastropathies/abstract/2,4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-6</a>]. The enhanced activity of EGFR in M&eacute;n&eacute;trier's is related to overproduction of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), a ligand that can bind and activate EGFR. TGF-alpha is produced by the oxyntic mucosa, predominantly by the parietal cells; however, the molecular defect that results in the localized upregulation of TGF-alpha is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-gastric-folds-hyperplastic-and-nonhyperplastic-gastropathies/abstract/2,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6</a>]. TGF-alpha is known to stimulate growth of epithelial cells and inhibit gastric acid secretion. The decreased acid production may be due to both direct effects on the parietal cells and indirectly via stimulation of somatostatin release.</p><p>Gastric infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) is postulated to be an important cause of M&eacute;n&eacute;trier's disease in children. One-third of the children with M&eacute;n&eacute;trier's reportedly have CMV-associated M&eacute;n&eacute;trier's disease, which usually spontaneously resolves in two to four weeks. It has been difficult to prove that an actual infection with CMV is present in these pediatric cases, due to the high prevalence of CMV infection in children. It is interesting, however, that one study suggested that CMV infects cells by interacting with EGFR, thereby activating a tyrosine kinase, a requirement for viral particle entry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-gastric-folds-hyperplastic-and-nonhyperplastic-gastropathies/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. TGF-alpha was found to be increased by immunohistochemistry in one childhood and one adult case of CMV-associated M&eacute;n&eacute;trier's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-gastric-folds-hyperplastic-and-nonhyperplastic-gastropathies/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. As CMV is cleared from the stomach, the stimulus to the EGFR is decreased, thus resulting in less TGF-alpha production, lessened cell proliferation, and a return to normal anatomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with M&eacute;n&eacute;trier's disease can present with a variety of clinical features including epigastric pain, substantial weight loss, nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding, diarrhea, and protein-losing gastroenteropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-gastric-folds-hyperplastic-and-nonhyperplastic-gastropathies/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-losing-gastroenteropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protein-losing gastroenteropathy&quot;</a>).

The most common diagnoses in the remainder were gastric polyps and polyposis syndromes (13 of 48 patients, 28 percent).

One case report suggested that production of an enteroendocrine mucosal growth factor, glucagon-like peptide (GLP-2), is upregulated in <em>H. pylori</em> infection. It is hypothesized that the increase in this trophic hormone may result in the formation of giant folds, which then recede along with the serum GLP-2 levels with resolution of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-gastric-folds-hyperplastic-and-nonhyperplastic-gastropathies/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Another study demonstrated different levels of cytokine production associated with different strains of <em>H. pylori</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-gastric-folds-hyperplastic-and-nonhyperplastic-gastropathies/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. They found that the <em>H. pylori</em> isolated from a patient with M&eacute;n&eacute;trier's disease induced the production of high levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) mRNA expression. HGF has been reported to alter the tight junctions of gastric epithelial cells, which would lead to protein loss. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastric neoplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neoplasms, particularly lymphoma, adenocarcinoma, and carcinoid tumors, should be excluded in patients with enlarged gastric folds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-gastric-folds-hyperplastic-and-nonhyperplastic-gastropathies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Diffuse mucosal hypertrophy may be hyperplastic or nonhyperplastic.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperplastic gastropathies include M&eacute;n&eacute;trier's disease and its rare variant, hyperplastic hypersecretory gastropathy, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Large gastric folds associated with other conditions include various gastridities, infiltrative diseases, infections, and malignancy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Hyperplastic gastropathies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Large gastric folds associated with other conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>M&eacute;n&eacute;trier's disease is a rare acquired condition of the stomach. Patients with M&eacute;n&eacute;trier's disease can present with a variety of clinical features including epigastric pain, substantial weight loss, nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding, diarrhea, and protein-losing gastroenteropathy with edema formation. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'M&eacute;n&eacute;trier's disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyposis syndromes (the most common mimics of M&eacute;n&eacute;trier's disease) are distinguished by genetic testing,&nbsp;history of familial polyposis, and extra-gastric&nbsp;pathology.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Multiple medical treatments for M&eacute;n&eacute;trier's disease have been utilized (cytomegalovirus <span class=\"nowrap\">[CMV]/Helicobacter</span> treatment, gastric antisecretory agents, somatostatin analogues, a monoclonal antibody to the epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]), although more trials are needed. Our approach is to treat <em>H. pylori</em> or CMV infection, if present. If absent, we perform a one- to three-month trial of a proton pump inhibitor given twice daily. Should this trial fail, either a trial of a monoclonal antibody to EGFR or total gastrectomy is warranted. In rare cases with massive or unrelenting bleeding that is uncontrollable endoscopically, gastrectomy will be required.
