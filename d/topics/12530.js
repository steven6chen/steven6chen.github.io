Ptosis may be the presenting sign or symptom of serious neurologic disease. Regardless of the etiology, when ptosis obstructs vision, it is disabling. The appropriate management requires recognition of the underlying cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The facial or seventh nerve innervates the circumferential orbicularis oculi to close the upper and lower eyelids. The oculomotor or third cranial nerve innervates the levator palpebrae superioris to elevate the upper eyelid. The levator palpebrae superioris becomes a tendinous aponeurosis, which fuses with the anterior superior portion of the superior tarsal plate and possibly the pretarsal skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69153\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69153 \">figure 1</a>). This junction of the aponeurosis to the tarsus and orbicularis oculi forms the eyelid crease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>An additional accessory smooth muscle, M&uuml;ller's muscle, is innervated by the sympathetic nervous system. It arises from the undersurface of the levator palpebrae superioris and inserts into the superior tarsus. It contributes approximately 1 to 2 mm to the elevation of the upper eyelid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69153\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69153 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. M&uuml;ller's muscle contributes to the over-elevation of the eyelid when a patient becomes excited or fearful and leads to mild ptosis with fatigue or inattention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Landmarks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal eyelid crease is 6 to 7 mm away from the eyelid margin in adults. This crease is not appreciable in most Asian eyelids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The upper eyelid normally covers the top 1 mm of the cornea, and the lower eyelid typically lies at the junction of the cornea and sclera (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78269\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78269 \">picture 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The palpebral fissure (PF) represents the distance between the upper and lower eyelid margins at the axis of the pupil. The normal PF measures 9 to 12 mm.</p><p>A point source of light directed at the patient creates a central pupillary light reflex. The distance from this reflex to the upper eyelid margin is called the margin reflex distance (MRD). Normally this measures 4 to 5 mm. Margin reflex distance is often more helpful than PF since lower lid position may vary individually.</p><p>The PF and MRD provide an objective means of identifying ptosis and measuring its severity that may be useful in planning treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history and physical examination can identify the cause of ptosis in most patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F63515\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63515 \">table 1</a>). Additional diagnostic tests are indicated in some patients. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The historical features center on the timing and associated symptoms of the ptosis. Important information to gather includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has it been present from birth?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Was this acute or slowly progressive?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the degree of ptosis vary over the course of the day or with fatigue?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there any associated headache or diplopia?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a history of ocular surgery, trauma (including birth trauma), or contact lens wear?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a family history of ptosis?</p><p/><p>It may be helpful to consult family members and review old photographs to understand the duration and progression of the condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of examination features may help determine the cause of ptosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F63515\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63515 \">table 1</a>). The examination begins with noting head posture and eyebrow position. Patients with ptosis may assume a chin up position to look through the lowered palpebral fissure. The eyebrows may be elevated in an effort to raise the lids. Next, the eyelid position should be noted with the patient at rest with the eyebrows relaxed and the eyes in primary gaze. Anatomic landmarks: eyelid crease, palpebral fissure (PF) and margin reflex distance (MRD) should be specifically noted (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Landmarks'</a> above). The PF might increase in downgaze in congenital ptosis but generally decreases in downgaze in acquired causes of ptosis.</p><p>Hering's law of equal innervation applies to eyelid muscles, which are innervated by a single midline brainstem nucleus providing equal bilateral central output. In unilateral ptosis, excessive innervational stimulation often causes the contralateral eyelid to appear retracted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F80069\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80069 \">picture 2</a>). If ptosis is bilateral but asymmetric, the less affected eyelid may appear normal. This can sometimes be detected by manual elevation of the obviously ptotic eyelid; a fall of the contralateral eyelid or &quot;curtaining&quot; confirms the bilaterality of the condition.</p><p>Levator function (LF) is assessed by measuring the excursion of the eyelid margin from downgaze to upgaze. Stabilizing the eyebrow to avoid overestimating the excursion of the lid margin may be accomplished by gentle fingertip pressure on the brow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60401\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60401 \">picture 3</a>). Normal LF is greater than 12 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Horner syndrome causes ptosis by reducing activity of M&uuml;ller's muscle; LF remains intact. LF is also preserved in acquired aponeurotic ptosis. Myopathic, congenital, and neuromuscular junction causes of ptosis have reduced LF.</p><p>With the patient looking downward, the physician can measure the distance from the eyelid crease to the eyelid margin (normal approximately 6.5 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. An increased distance or redundancy of the eyelid crease suggests levator aponeurosis dehiscence or slippage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This crease is not appreciable in most Asian eyelids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The crease is often less distinct or absent in patients with congenital ptosis.</p><p>The examination should also include notation of pupil size and reactivity. When a third nerve palsy involves the pupil, it will appear larger than the contralateral pupil and react poorly to light and accommodation. In contrast, an ipsilateral, miotic pupil with normal reactivity will accompany ptosis in the setting of a Horner syndrome. The anisocoria is more evident in a darkened room.</p><p>Extraocular motility and ocular alignment should be tested. Lesions of the third cranial nerve will frequently include some eye movement abnormality (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Third nerve palsy'</a> below). Orbicularis weakness suggests a myopathic or neuromuscular junction cause. Myopathic disease often results in bilateral symmetric ophthalmoplegia without diplopia. Eye movements may be normal or abnormal in cases of myasthenia gravis.</p><p>Evidence of levator fatigue should be sought for the diagnosis of neuromuscular junction disease. If the ptosis fluctuates throughout the examination, then evidence for fatigability of the levator muscle is present. Fatigue can also be induced by prolonged activation of the levator palpebrae muscle in sustained upgaze for one to two minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Enhancement of ptosis during prolonged upgaze or upon return to primary gaze suggests fatigability. Eyelid &quot;curtaining&quot; as discussed above is suggestive but not specific for fatigability. Finally, a Cogan lid twitch, a transient overshoot of eyelid position when patient saccades from downgaze to primary gaze position also suggests eyelid fatigability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ocular-myasthenia-gravis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ocular myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Examination for eyelid fatigue'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The underlying etiology of ptosis is generally apparent after history and physical examination. The major clinical features of the more common causes are presented (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F63515\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63515 \">table 1</a>). Additional diagnostic testing may help confirm some diagnoses. As an example, an imaging study is indicated only in patients who have a third nerve palsy or Horner syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital ptosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital ptosis is most often associated with absence or reduction of striated levator palpebrae superioris muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. M&uuml;ller's muscle remains relatively intact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Congenital ptosis is usually unilateral (in 69 to 75 percent), neurologically isolated, and nonprogressive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. There can be a familial association, but it may be unrecognized if family members are only mildly affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Levator function (LF) varies in proportion to the degree of ptosis. Lid creases are often absent or lower than normal. Other ophthalmologic findings may include amblyopia and strabismus in 20 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. Approximately 5 percent of these patients cannot elevate the involved eye, presumably because the superior rectus and levator palpebrae superioris originate from a common embryologic source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Rarely, a patient may have congenitally aberrant innervation of the levator muscle by the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (Marcus Gunn jaw winking) causing eyelid retraction when the patient contracts the pterygoid muscle during the acts of sucking, jaw opening, or lateral jaw movement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F57508\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57508 \">picture 4</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. LF is variable or decreased, the upper eyelid crease is present, and there may be a strabismus.</p><p>Congenital orbital fibrosis, an autosomal dominant inherited condition producing fibrosis of the extraocular muscles and limited eye movements, sometimes includes associated ptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-vertical-strabismus-in-children#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of vertical strabismus in children&quot;, section on 'Congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles'</a>). Blepharophimosis is another dominantly inherited condition associated with severe bilateral ptosis with telecanthus, hypertelorism, and epicanthus inversus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>A congenital Horner syndrome produces a lighter colored iris on the affected side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In the absence of clear birth trauma, any child with a Horner syndrome should be evaluated for secondary causes. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Horner syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Aponeurotic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adults, the most common cause of acquired ptosis is spontaneous disinsertion or dehiscence of the levator aponeurosis, the tendon connecting the levator to the tarsal plate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Clinical features include elevated or absent lid crease due to weakened attachments to the tarsus and orbicularis oculi (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F80069\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80069 \">picture 2</a>). LF remains intact. </p><p>In the elderly, aponeurotic ptosis usually results from a naturally occurring involutional change. In younger patients, ptosis may result from contact lens wear, presumably from repetitive manipulation of the upper lid during lens insertion or removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. This is more common in rigid or hard contact lens use.</p><p>Ptosis may develop after ocular surgery when an eyelid speculum is used. Six percent of cataract surgeries have postoperative ptosis as a complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Older patients with already weakened aponeurosis are believed to be at higher risk, but postoperative ptosis is a well-documented phenomenon in young patients as well; 10 percent of patients with an average age of 34 years developed ptosis after radial keratotomy in one reported series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Trauma and chronic lid rubbing are other causes of aponeurotic ptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanical</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanical ptosis can occur as a result of excess weight on the upper lid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F74219\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74219 \">picture 5</a>). Causes include infections, inflammation, and eyelid tumors (dermoid cyst, metastatic neuroblastoma, chalazion, rhabdomyosarcoma, neurofibroma, hemangioma, others) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eyelid-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eyelid lesions&quot;</a>). Mechanical ptosis can easily be diagnosed from examination and history.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurologic disease affecting the muscle, neuromuscular junction, cranial nerve, and the brainstem may lead to ptosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Third nerve palsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The inferior division of the oculomotor nerve (CN3) innervates the ipsilateral inferior rectus, medial rectus, and inferior oblique. It also carries the efferent pupillary fibers from the Edinger Westphal nucleus. The superior division innervates the superior rectus and levator palpebrae superioris. The brainstem subnucleus of the levator is unpaired, and a lesion there produces bilateral ptosis. Peripheral third nerve lesions are much more common.</p><p>A complete third nerve palsy is easily recognizable with profound ptosis, significant ophthalmoplegia, and diplopia. Because profound ptosis may occlude vision, the patient may not have diplopia and may be unaware of pupillary involvement. LF is decreased or absent. If involved, the pupil may be mid-dilated and poorly reactive, and the anisocoria will be more prominent in bright light. Partial oculomotor weakness may show only mild ptosis, and eye movement abnormalities can be subtle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69413\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69413 \">picture 6</a>).</p><p>Dysfunction of the third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) can result from lesions anywhere along its path between the oculomotor nucleus in the midbrain and the extraocular muscles within the orbit. Causes range in severity from those that are immediately life-threatening to those that are benign and self-limited. This topic is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Horner syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical triad of Horner syndrome, ipsilateral ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis, is produced from a disruption in the three-neuron oculosympathetic chain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F54798\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54798 \">picture 7</a>). Anhidrosis may be absent or unnoticed, but miosis is invariable. The anisocoria appears more prominent in dim light with delayed dilation of the ipsilateral pupil. Since M&uuml;ller's muscle is affected instead of the levator superioris, the ptosis is mild, usually 1 to 2 mm. The ipsilateral lower lid can also be slightly higher, further narrowing the palpebral fissure. Other acute features of sympathetic disruption include ipsilateral conjunctival injection, nasal stuffiness, and increased near point of accommodation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Topical administration of 10 percent cocaine eyedrops can confirm the diagnosis of Horner syndrome. The normal pupil dilates more than the Horner pupil, increasing the degree of anisocoria. Alternatively, instillation of 0.5 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apraclonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apraclonidine</a> will dilate the Horner pupil and raise the Horner eyelid in many cases. Horner syndrome is discussed separately.

Ptosis and diplopia may occur in the Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), but they are rarely prominent or presenting symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. LEMS is not typically considered in the differential diagnosis of ptosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H309075\"><span class=\"h4\">Myasthenia gravis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MG is an autoimmune disorder directed at the postganglionic acetylcholine receptors in the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscles. The hallmark of MG is the variability and fatigability of both signs and symptoms. The initial presentation may occur as isolated ocular findings in approximately 50 percent of cases. Unilateral or bilateral ptosis can develop with or without diplopia and ocular motor deficits. Fatigability, Cogan's lid twitch, orbicularis oculi weakness, and curtaining (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Examination'</a> above) are frequently seen but are neither requirements nor pathognomonic findings of myasthenia. LF is often abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Resting with eyes closed for several minutes, or placing an ice pack on the ptotic eyelid for one minute may result in transient improvement of ptosis secondary to MG. The diagnosis and management of ocular MG are discussed separately.

Genetic testing for CPEO is commercially available. If negative, then the diagnosis requires a skeletal muscle biopsy. Ragged red fibers are seen with Gomori trichrome staining. In addition, tests for mitochondrial mutations, measurement of oxidative phosphorylation, and stains for cytochrome oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase can be helpful.

Causes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of posterior support in an enophthalmic eye may induce ptosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hypotropic eye that points downward appears to have a ptotic lid, but when the patient fixates with that eye the apparent droop disappears.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A patient with lid retraction of one eye may give the false impression of ptosis in the contralateral eye.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In elderly patients, redundant eyelid skin and prolapse of the orbital fat (dermatochalasis) can cause the eyelid to overhang the eyelid margin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F52091\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52091 \">picture 9</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Finally, a patient can artificially induce the appearance of ptosis by lowering the ipsilateral eyebrow and raising the contralateral one (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64679\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64679 \">picture 10</a>).</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonsurgical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of ptosis is not always satisfactory. Only myasthenia gravis (MG) responds to medical therapy, which is the treatment of choice. Eyelid crutches inserted into eyeglasses are a temporizing measure for some; other patients are considered for surgery, which has incomplete success and associated risks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is indicated primarily in patients who have an obscured visual field due to ptosis. Surgery may also be considered for cosmetic reasons, but patients should be aware of the potential complications. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>Surgical approaches to the correction of ptosis include M&uuml;ller muscle resection, levator muscle resection or advancement, and frontalis suspension:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>M&uuml;llerectomy may be considered for the treatment of Horner syndrome and for patients with milder degrees of ptosis (1 to 2 mm). Benefit may be predicted by installation of 10 percent neosynephrine or 2.5 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> eye drops, which stimulates M&uuml;ller's muscle. Improvement of ptosis by 2 to 3 mm after 10 minutes predicts a better response to this surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If good levator function (LF) is present, advancement of the levator aponeurosis is commonly performed to ameliorate ptosis. If the levator aponeurosis is disinserted, then it is reattached to the tarsus. If stretched thin, then the surgeon resects a portion of the aponeurosis before reinsertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is severe, bilateral ptosis and poor LF, frontalis suspension surgery is usually preferred. Various synthetic or autologous materials are used to form a sling, which lies below the skin surface and connects the upper eyelid to the frontalis muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with third nerve palsy, an interval of 6 to 12 months before surgical intervention is advised because many will have spontaneous recovery. Similarly, patients with MG should have stable disabling ptosis for several months on maximal medical therapy before considering surgical therapy.</p><p>Surgery is often also delayed in patients with muscle disease. Because of the progressive nature of the disease, repeated procedures are likely. Also, these patients are at higher risk of surgical complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common troubling complication of ptosis surgery is lagophthalmos or failure of the eye to close completely. This in turn may lead to dry eye and exposure keratopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This is more common in myopathic and neuromuscular junction disorders in which there is accompanying weakness of the orbicularis oculi. An impaired Bell's phenomenon (the superior rotation of the eyeball during eye closure in sleep and blinking) is also a risk factor for this complication. The presence of an impaired Bell's phenomenon as well as abnormal tear production or orbicularis oculi weakness will make the surgeon more reluctant to perform surgery and will lead to a more conservative surgical approach (ie, undercorrection).</p><p>Because of Hering's law of equal innervation, processes that produce bilateral but asymmetric ptosis may cause the less affected eye to appear normal. Postoperatively, the ptosis in this eye will be increased, perhaps apparent for the first time. Preoperatively, manual elevation of the more ptotic eyelid in a patient with unilateral ptosis may cause the higher eyelid to become ptotic (curtaining) indicating that bilateral surgical repair is needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78269\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78269 \">picture 1</a>). However, one report indicates that this may not be a sufficiently sensitive test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ptosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Other complications of ptosis surgery include scarring, deformity of the lid crease, and asymmetry or undercorrection of the lid position.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blepharoptosis is a drooping of the upper eyelid.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ptosis may be congenital or acquired. Acquired conditions may be related to disorders affecting the muscle tendon, muscle, neuromuscular junction, or nerve. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical history and examination will generally distinguish among the causes of ptosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F63515\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63515 \">table 1</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Third nerve palsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with stable, disabling ptosis may be considered for surgery. Ptosis severity, levator function (LF), and underlying etiology are used to guide the surgical procedure.
