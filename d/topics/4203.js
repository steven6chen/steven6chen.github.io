Infection control practices must be implemented, including contact precautions and hand hygiene. Hand hygiene with soap and water may be more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers in removing <em>C. difficile</em> spores, since <em>C. difficile</em> spores are resistant to killing by alcohol.
