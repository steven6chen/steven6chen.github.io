Patients with diabetes have an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease, and this, combined with the frequent microvascular complications of the disease, often translate into more surgical interventions.</p><p>Careful assessment of patients with diabetes prior to surgery is required because of their complexity and high risk of coronary heart disease, which may be relatively asymptomatic compared with the nondiabetic population. Diabetes mellitus is also associated with increased risk of perioperative infection and postoperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>One key aspect of the perioperative management is glycemic control; complex interplay of the operative procedure, anesthesia, and additional postoperative factors such as sepsis, disrupted meal schedules and altered nutritional intake, hyperalimentation, and emesis can lead to labile blood glucose levels. A rational approach to diabetes mellitus management allows the clinician to anticipate alterations in glucose and improve glycemic control perioperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>This review will discuss the preoperative evaluation of patients with diabetes, general goals of glycemic control, and management of blood glucose in the perioperative phase. The special circumstances of glucocorticoid therapy and hyperalimentation are also reviewed. More details regarding glucose control in hospitalized patients in general are found separately.

These neurohormonal changes result in metabolic abnormalities including insulin resistance, decreased peripheral glucose utilization, impaired insulin secretion, increased lipolysis, and protein catabolism, leading to hyperglycemia and even ketosis in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-14</a>].</p><p>The magnitude of counterregulatory hormone release varies per individual and is influenced by the type of anesthesia (general anesthesia is associated with larger metabolic abnormalities as compared with epidural anesthesia), the extent of the surgery (cardiovascular bypass surgery resulting in significantly higher degree of insulin resistance), and additional postoperative factors such as sepsis, hyperalimentation, and glucocorticoid use. The hyperglycemic response to these factors may be attenuated by the lack of caloric intake during and immediately after surgery, making the final glycemic balance difficult to predict.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21261166\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21261379\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preoperative evaluation of any patient, including those with diabetes mellitus, focuses on cardiopulmonary risk assessment and modification. Coronary heart disease is much more common in individuals with diabetes than in the general population, and in addition, patients with diabetes have an increased risk of silent ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

Other associated conditions, such as hypertension, obesity, chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, and autonomic neuropathy, need to be assessed prior to surgery as these conditions may complicate anesthesia and postoperative care.

Further investigations including noninvasive cardiac testing should be considered on an individual basis.

A1C levels will permit the determination of chronic glycemic control, and this is an important element in determining adequacy of current glycemic management, especially insulin dose, in insulin-requiring patients. There is some suggestion that elevated A1C levels predict a higher rate of postoperative adverse events, including infections, myocardial infarction, and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-23</a>]. As an example, in an analysis of 3089 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting, who had A1C measured as part of routine preoperative labs, higher A1C was associated with an increased incidence of death, myocardial infarction, and sternal wound infection (odds ratio [OR] approximately 1.4 per unit increase in A1C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Hypoglycemia and subsequent neuroglucopenia can be difficult to detect in sedated or anesthetized patients. (See <a href=\"#H23238898\" class=\"local\">'Hypoglycemia'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus are insulin deficient and are prone to developing ketosis and acidosis. A common mistake is to manage these patients like type 2 diabetes patients who are not ketosis prone and, for example, holding long-acting insulin if the glucose level is in the normal range, with the consequent risk of ketoacidosis. Similarly, failure to provide premeal, rapid-acting insulin for persons with type 1 diabetes will result in unacceptable postmeal glucose excursions. Type 2 diabetes patients are susceptible to developing hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (also known as nonketotic hyperosmolar state) that may lead to severe volume depletion and neurologic complications, and they may develop ketoacidosis in the setting of extreme stress.

Although there are varying opinions on what the target blood glucose should be, there is little evidence to support specific targets. Given the risk of hypoglycemia (especially in unmonitored settings), in our practice, we aim to keep glucose readings between 110 and 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (6.1 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. In a meta-analysis of 12 randomized trials (1403 patients with diabetes) comparing intensive (&lt;120 or &lt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [&lt;6.7 or &lt;8.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> versus conventional (variable) glycemic control in the perioperative period, intensive glycemic control perioperatively was not associated with any reductions in infectious complications, cardiovascular events, or mortality, but it was associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Among the trials, the mean difference in achieved blood glucose levels between the intensive and conventional groups ranged from -13 to -91 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.72 to 5.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p>Diabetes guideline bodies recommend glycemic targets of between 110 and 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (6.1 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> for noncritically ill hospitalized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. However, a less stringent glucose target (&lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [11 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> may be considered depending on risk for hypoglycemia and also potentially in the general patient population (given the acknowledged lack of evidence to support more stringent targets). The risk of hypoglycemia can be reduced by frequent glucose monitoring and carefully designed management protocols. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has endorsed a target glucose range for the perioperative period of 80 to 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.4 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Most protocols for insulin administration are formulated by expert opinion and personal experience. The strategies described below, while sensible, have not been proven to optimally reduce outcomes of morbidity, mortality, and hospital length of stay. The role of insulin infusions has not been clarified, but these strategies are often expensive, labor intensive, and even impossible at some hospitals. Ultimately, even well-coordinated plans for diabetic management are dynamic, being influenced by predictable and sometimes unpredictable events. Decisions of which regimens to utilize and when will depend upon individual patients, hospital settings and resources, and the clinician's own judgment.</p><p>Ideally, all patients with diabetes mellitus should have their surgery as early as possible in the morning to minimize the disruption of their management routine while being nil per os (NPO).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 2 diabetes treated with diet alone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generally, patients with type 2 diabetes managed by diet alone do not require any therapy perioperatively.

Fingerstick glucose levels are less reliable in patients who are critically ill, are on vasopressor agents, or hypotensive, and venous or arterial blood and laboratory testing should be used in these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Correction insulin alone should not be used as the sole treatment for patients with type 1 diabetes, in whom ketosis can occur before significant hyperglycemia is present, or for insulin-treated type 2 diabetes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dosing </strong>&ndash; Corrective insulin typically is given when glucose levels are &gt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (8.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> and the amount of insulin depends upon the degree of insulin sensitivity of the patient, caloric intake, and the glycemic target (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F83834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83834 \">table 2</a>) (see <a href=\"#H27486643\" class=\"local\">'Glycemic targets'</a> above). Older, lean, type 1 diabetes patients or individuals with renal or liver failure are usually considered to be &quot;insulin sensitive,&quot; while obesity or treatment with glucocorticoids are usually associated with an insulin-resistant state. Smaller doses of insulin are given at bedtime to avoid nocturnal hypoglycemia. Many different regimens have been used, with no studies demonstrating the superiority of one over the others. Since there is a large patient-to-patient variability in terms of insulin sensitivity and response to clinical changes, the absolute dose choice is empirical and most importantly, frequent (daily) adjustments based on glucose levels need to be made.

Less commonly, hypoglycemia may also affect patients with type 2 diabetes who take a sulfonylurea or a meglitinide or who use insulin. Prevention of severe hypoglycemia requires the recognition of early symptoms and signs by the patient (and by those around them). Avoiding hypoglycemia during anesthesia and in the postoperative phase is important because hypoglycemic symptoms are virtually impossible for the sedated patient to sense and, similarly, its signs are difficult for health care providers to detect.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Goals</strong> &ndash; The goals in the perioperative setting are to preoperatively identify patients at highest risk for hypoglycemia, appropriately adjust diabetes treatment preoperatively to prevent its occurrence, and monitor for any episodes of hypoglycemia by measuring glucose levels to ensure prompt treatment. Patients at particularly high risk for perioperative hypoglycemia include patients with &quot;tight&quot; glycemic control, labile blood glucoses, or history of frequent hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monitoring</strong> &ndash; In the perioperative setting, hypoglycemia can be detected through monitoring of blood glucose levels, which are typically checked every one to two hours during surgery (for patients treated with insulin or insulin secretagogues).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After recovery from anesthesia or sedation, hypoglycemia may be suspected based upon symptoms, including tremor, palpitations, anxiety, sweating, hunger, and paresthesias. The hypoglycemic thresholds at which these symptoms occur are very variable. In patients with diabetes, these symptoms of hypoglycemia may occur at glucose levels of &lt;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Hypoglycemia can also cause cognitive dysfunction, which may occur at plasma glucose concentrations below 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. More severe neurologic symptoms, including obtundation, seizures, and coma, occur with progressive hypoglycemia. The glycemic thresholds for these responses shift to higher plasma glucose concentrations in patients with poorly controlled diabetes and to lower plasma glucose concentrations in patients with repeated episodes of hypoglycemia, such as may be associated with intensive therapy of diabetes.

Twice-daily intermediate-acting insulin with short-acting insulin given in a subcutaneous sliding scale may be needed to achieve glucose control in patients using longer-acting steroids or patients on steroids dosed twice daily. A two- to threefold increase in the total daily insulin dose is frequently needed in patients on high-dose steroid therapy.

Once the patient is on a stable infusion rate of TPN, <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> may have the daily requirement of insulin directly added to the TPN solution bag. As an example, if the patient requires 20 units of insulin per 24 hours, add 20 units of short-acting insulin in the TPN solution that is administered continuously over 24 hours. A subcutaneous insulin sliding scale using short-acting insulin may be used initially to identify the 24-hour insulin requirement if insulin infusion is not feasible, and should be converted to a twice-daily, intermediate-acting insulin if the TPN solution and rate are stable. TPN orders should always include an order to substitute dextrose infusion and recalibrate insulin dosing if the TPN is interrupted for more than an hour.</p><p>For nasogastric feeds administered continuously over 24 hours, either a variable rate IV insulin infusion or twice-daily intermediate-acting insulin plus sliding-scale short-acting insulin every four to six hours may be administered. Changes in insulin regimen must precede any changes in nasogastric feeding regimens (ie, changes from 24-hour infusion to three times a day bolus feeds). As with TPN, interruption of continuous enteral feeding for more than an hour will require IV dextrose to prevent hypoglycemia and recalibration of insulin dosing. Thus, good communication between the surgeon, dietitian, and the person managing diabetes care is important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1847153\"><span class=\"h2\">Emergency procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When emergency surgery is required in a patient with diabetes whose glucose levels are very high (for example, greater than 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [13.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> or low enough to threaten hypoglycemia (&lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> blood glucose levels should be monitored with fingerstick or whole venous blood methods at least every hour and more frequently for blood glucose levels &lt;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients with type 1 diabetes and very elevated glucose levels may be managed most conveniently with an IV insulin infusion through a reliable IV access.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with type 2 diabetes and elevated blood glucose levels (&gt;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [13.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> who require emergency surgery, we treat with an IV insulin infusion or subcutaneous insulin. For long procedures, an insulin infusion is preferred. If the patient had been using a long-acting basal insulin (eg, glargine, degludec) once daily or a continuous infusion of short- or rapid-acting insulin (insulin pump), it should be continued along with the IV insulin infusion or additional corrective subcutaneous insulin.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H159435611\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The strategies described below, while sensible, have not been proven to optimally reduce outcomes of morbidity, mortality, and hospital length of stay. Most protocols for insulin administration are formulated by expert opinion and personal experience.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients require a careful preoperative history and physical examination, with further evaluation required in certain individuals. Basic laboratory investigation should include a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG), assessment of renal function (serum creatinine), glycated hemoglobin (A1C) if not measured in previous four to six weeks, and blood glucose (see <a href=\"#H21261166\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> above). Associated conditions, such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, obesity, chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, and autonomic neuropathy, need to be assessed prior to surgery as these conditions may complicate anesthesia and postoperative care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevalence of and risk factors for coronary heart disease in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the obese patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of perioperative diabetic management include avoidance of hypoglycemia, prevention of ketoacidosis, maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance, and avoidance of marked hyperglycemia. (See <a href=\"#H27486620\" class=\"local\">'General goals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are few studies evaluating the optimal intraoperative blood glucose level for patients with diabetes. During surgical procedures and in the postoperative phase, we aim to keep the glucose readings between 110 and 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (6.1 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Glycemic targets must take into account the individual patient's situation and whether these goals can be safely achieved within each individual hospital system. (See <a href=\"#H27486643\" class=\"local\">'Glycemic targets'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ideally, all patients with diabetes mellitus should have their surgery prior to 9 AM to minimize the disruption of their management routine while being nil per os (NPO). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Perioperative phase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For short procedures, patients with type 2 diabetes managed by diet alone may not require any therapy perioperatively. Supplemental short- (eg, regular) or rapid-acting (eg, lispro, aspart, or glulisine) insulin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73676 \">table 1</a>) may be given (typically every six hours) to patients whose glucose levels rise over the desired target (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F83834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83834 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Type 2 diabetes treated with diet alone'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23238691\" class=\"local\">'Correction insulin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with type 2 diabetes who take oral hypoglycemic drugs or noninsulin injectables (eg, glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] analogs) are advised to hold their oral hypoglycemic and noninsulin injectable drugs on the morning of surgery. For patients who develop hyperglycemia, supplemental short- or rapid-acting insulin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73676 \">table 1</a>) may be administered subcutaneously (typically every six hours), based on frequently (every one to two hours) measured glucose levels which are often obtained on capillary &quot;fingerstick&quot; samples (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F83834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83834 \">table 2</a>). Correction insulin is administered until the patient is eating and either can resume oral <span class=\"nowrap\">agents/noninsulin</span> injectables or a basal-bolus insulin regimen is initiated. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Type 2 diabetes treated with oral hypoglycemic agents/noninsulin injectables'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23238691\" class=\"local\">'Correction insulin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generally, patients who use insulin can continue with subcutaneous insulin perioperatively at a reduced dose (rather than an insulin infusion) for procedures that are not long and complex (eg, no more than one or two missed meals). However, intravenous (IV) insulin is usually required for long and complex procedures (eg, coronary artery bypass graft, renal transplant, or prolonged neurosurgical operations). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Type 1 or insulin-treated type 2 diabetes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generally, the preoperative diabetes treatment regimen (oral agents, noninsulin injectables, oral agents plus insulin, or basal-bolus insulin) may be reinstated once the patient is eating well. However, there are a few caveats for certain oral hypoglycemic agents. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative phase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding hypoglycemia during anesthesia and in the postoperative phase is important because hypoglycemic symptoms are virtually impossible for the sedated patient to sense, and similarly, its signs are difficult for health care providers to detect. For a sedated, anesthetized patient with a blood glucose of &lt;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> we typically administer IV dextrose (25 g) and repeat blood glucose measurements in 5 to 10 minutes. (See <a href=\"#H23238898\" class=\"local\">'Hypoglycemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the awake patient with a normal swallowing mechanism and gag reflex, symptomatic hypoglycemia is typically treated with at least 15 g of carbohydrates (glucose tablet, sweetened fruit juice). In patients unable to take anything by mouth, hypoglycemia can be treated by giving 25 g of 50 percent glucose (dextrose) intravenously. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hypoglycemia-during-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hypoglycemia during treatment of diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Treatment of hypoglycemia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucose control in critically ill patients is discussed separately.
