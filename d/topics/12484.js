Niemann-Pick disease originally was defined in terms of its histology as a reticuloendotheliosis. It now is subdivided into two major categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51071\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51071 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Niemann-Pick disease type A and type B are allelic disorders caused by mutations in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase-1 gene (SMPD1), and characterized by a primary deficiency of acid sphingomyelinase activity</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Niemann-Pick disease type C is caused by mutations of the NPC1 and NPC2 genes that result in impaired cellular processing and transport of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">NPD type A</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Niemann-Pick disease type A (NPD-A; MIM 257200) is the acute neuronopathic form. The incidence of NPD-A is highest among Ashkenazi Jews, in whom the gene frequency is estimated to be 1:100. The overall prevalence of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (types A and B combined) is estimated to be 1:250,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Affected patients present with hepatosplenomegaly, feeding difficulties, and loss of early motor skills in the first few months of life. Rapid, progressive, and profound loss of neurologic function leading to death occurs by two to three years of age. A peripheral neuropathy is manifest as hypotonia and absent reflexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Storage of sphingomyelin in pulmonary macrophages leads to interstitial lung disease, frequent respiratory infections, and often to respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Macular cherry red spots (seen on funduscopic examination) are eventually present in all affected individuals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65650\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65650 \">picture 1</a>), although they may not be observed early in the course of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In a natural history study of 10 infants with NPD-A, all except one infant had a normal neonatal course and early development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The one exception had jaundice that resolved without treatment. The first detected sign of the disease was organomegaly, noted at a median of three months (range two to four). The median age at diagnosis was six months. A cherry red spot was evident in all infants by 12 months of age, but was absent in several on initial examination. No infant progressed beyond the gross motor milestone of sitting with support; none ever crawled on all fours or walked. Social smile was retained well into the disease course, and was lost at a median age of 19 months. Death (from respiratory failure in nine patients and bleeding in one) occurred at a median age of 27 months (range 19 to 35).</p><p>The laboratory findings may include lipid abnormalities such as decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia, and increased LDL-cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Electron microscopy reveals lysosomal inclusions and myelin inclusions in peripheral nerves, indicating a severe myelinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Type A disease is caused by mutations in the acid sphingomyelinase gene, also known as the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 or SMPD1 gene, on chromosome 11p15, that result in complete absence of residual acid sphingomyelinase activity and subsequent lysosomal accumulation of sphingomyelin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">NPD type B</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Niemann-Pick disease type B (NPD-B; MIM 607616) is pan-ethnic and generally later in onset and less severe than NPD-A, with a good prognosis for survival into adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As already mentioned, the overall prevalence of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (types A and B combined) is estimated to be 1:250,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>NPD-B is characterized by the development of hepatosplenomegaly during infancy or childhood. Most affected patients have thrombocytopenia secondary to hypersplenism. Liver involvement can be severe, with infiltration of foamy histiocytes, ballooning of hepatocytes, and fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Other systemic manifestations include short stature with delayed skeletal maturation, interstitial lung disease, hyperlipidemia, and ocular abnormalities (macular halos and cherry red maculae, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65650\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65650 \">picture 1</a>)) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. The natural history is one of progressive hypersplenism and gradual deterioration of pulmonary function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Most patients with NPD-B have no neurologic abnormalities. However, in those who survive early childhood, prolonged nerve conduction velocities and varying degrees of central nervous system involvement may be present, including cerebellar signs, nystagmus, extrapyramidal involvement, intellectual disability (mental retardation), psychiatric disorders, and peripheral neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/4,17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,17-21</a>]. In one series of 64 patients with NPD-B, neurologic abnormalities were observed in 30 percent; these were minor and nonprogressive in 22 percent, and global and progressive in 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In the latter group, the onset of neurologic abnormalities occurred between the ages of two and seven years.</p><p>Although data are limited, brain MRI may show pronounced cerebellar and mild supratentorial atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Other laboratory abnormalities may include liver dysfunction, decreased HDL cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia, and increased LDL-cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The atherogenic lipid profile worsens over time, whereas the liver dysfunction remains stable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>NPD-B is associated with mutations of the acid sphingomyelinase gene (SMPD1 gene) that result in acid sphingomyelinase deficiency with some residual activity of the enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/9,10,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,22</a>]. In two studies, for example, acid sphingomyelinase activity in patients with NPD-B was 4 percent of normal compared with undetectable activity in patients with NPD-A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/9,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">NPD type C</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPD-C) can present from the perinatal period until late adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>]. The disorder has an estimated prevalence of 1:100,000 in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. NPD-C has two genotypes related to mutations in the NPC1 gene (NPD-C1; MIM 257220) or to mutations in the NPC2 gene (NPD-C2; MIM 607625). Systemic involvement of liver, spleen or lung, is present in &ge;85 percent of patients, and precedes the development of neurologic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The age on onset and clinical presentation of NPD-C is highly variable.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with NPD-C have disease onset in middle to late childhood after normal early development. These patients typically have cerebellar involvement characterized by clumsiness and gait problems progressing to frank ataxia, and slow cognitive deterioration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/25,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28</a>]. Vertical supranuclear ophthalmoplegia is another early manifestation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supranuclear disorders of gaze in children&quot;</a>). Progressive dystonia, dysarthria, and dysphagia occur, eventually impairing oral feeding, and approximately one-third of patients develop seizures. Death typically occurs from aspiration pneumonia in the second or third decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal onset of NPD-C may occur, presenting with severe hepatic disease from infiltration of the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In addition, pulmonary disease with respiratory failure secondary to alveolar proteinosis may accompany neonatal hepatic disease or occur as the initial presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Fetal onset of NPD-C is most often associated with ultrasonographic findings of splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and ascites or fetal hydrops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].<br/><br/>A separate infantile form presents with hypotonia and developmental delay with little or no hepatic and pulmonary involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adult onset of NPD-C may present with ataxia, supranuclear vertical gaze palsy, cognitive impairment, and other symptoms similar to earlier onset disease, except that progression is generally much slower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/25,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,33</a>]. Other adults present with cognitive dysfunction or psychiatric disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/34-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-39</a>]. In some cases of NPD-C, subtle premonitory signs or symptoms in childhood, such as splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, learning difficulty, deafness, or impaired vertical gaze, may precede neurologic deterioration in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p>Volumetric changes on brain MRI in patients with NPD-C include gray matter reductions involving the thalamus, hippocampus, striatum, cerebellum, and insular cortex, as well as white matter reductions involving the corpus callosum and widespread reductions in fractional anisotropy of white matter tracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) may show early changes prior to MRI findings, but data are limited. Reported findings include decreased n-acetyl <span class=\"nowrap\">aspartate/creatine</span> ratios in the frontal and parietal cortex, centrum semiovale and caudate nucleus with increased <span class=\"nowrap\">choline/creatinine</span> ratios in the frontal cortex and centrum semiovale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Genetics of NPD-C</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two separate disease gene loci for NPD-C: the NPC1 gene on chromosome 18q11-q12, and the NPC2 gene (also called the HE1 gene) on chromosome 14q24.3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/24,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,44,45</a>].</p><p>Mutations in the NPC1 gene can be identified in approximately 95 percent of NPD-C cases, while mutations in NPC2 account for approximately 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-49</a>]. So-called Niemann-Pick type D is an allelic variant of NPD-C that results from a point mutation of NPC1 and occurs in descendants of an Acadian couple who were born in the late 1600s in Nova Scotia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p>NPC1 encodes a large membrane glycoprotein primarily located to late endosomes; this protein plays a role in the intracellular trafficking, levels, and distribution of LDL-cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/52-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-55</a>]. Disruption of this trafficking leads to lipid accumulation and neuronal degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. NPC2 encodes a small soluble lysosomal protein previously known as cholesterol-binding protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Mutations in both the NPC1 and NPC2 genes result in the accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and glycolipids in the <span class=\"nowrap\">lysosomal/late</span> endosomal system. The biochemical pattern is identical. The precise functions and relationship of the two genes remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) first depends upon an appreciation of the variable phenotypic manifestations.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The definitive diagnosis of NPD-A and NPD-B requires demonstration of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency, with residual acid sphingomyelinase activity &lt;10 percent of controls.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The definitive diagnosis of NPD-C requires demonstration of abnormal intracellular cholesterol trafficking by the impaired response to low-density lipoprotein&nbsp;(LDL)-cholesterol loading in cultured fibroblasts, as shown by reduced cholesterol esterification and excessive cholesterol accumulation (visualized by positive filipin staining).</p><p/><p>NPD is often erroneously omitted from the differential diagnosis in cases that lack organomegaly, but this is not a universal feature.

In rare cases, the use of a so-called &quot;artificial&quot; substrate rather than the natural sphingomyelin substrate has led to falsely normal or enhanced laboratory determination of sphingomyelinase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Molecular genetic testing can also confirm the diagnosis of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency if it identifies both disease-causing alleles, but such testing should only be used after biochemical testing for acid sphingomyelinase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Three common SMPD1 mutations account for approximately 90 percent of NPD-A cases among Ashkenazi Jews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>], and another common SMPD1 mutation accounts for approximately 90 percent of NPD-B cases among patients of North African descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Thus, for patients of Ashkenazi Jewish or North African descent, targeted mutation analysis is the preferred initial method of molecular genetic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Sequence analysis of SMPD1 is appropriate if targeted mutation analysis does not identify both mutations in patients with confirmed acid sphingomyelinase deficiency.

A risk prediction score of &ge;70 indicates a strong suspicion for NPD-C. The index was derived by a retrospective review that compared the clinical features of patients with NPD-C confirmed by filipin staining (n = 71), noncases excluded from the diagnosis of NPD-C by negative filipin staining (n = 64), and control patients who had at least one characteristic symptom of NPD-C (n = 81). Individual signs and symptoms were analyzed by logistic regression to develop prediction scores for NPD-C.</p><p>The clinical features most strongly associated with NPD-C were vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, gelastic cataplexy, isolated unexplained splenomegaly, prolonged neonatal jaundice or cholestasis, and premature cognitive decline or dementia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F85656\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85656 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Gelastic cataplexy had a high specificity but low sensitivity for NPD-C, and was noted to be rare among adults. Premature cognitive decline or dementia was common in NPD-C but was not highly specific.</p><p>The diagnosis of NPD-C is confirmed by fibroblast cell culture.

Formal esterification studies demonstrate delayed low-density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol esterification. Filipin staining shows an intense punctuate pattern of fluorescence concentrated around the nucleus, consistent with unesterified cholesterol.</p><p>Biopsies of tissues other than skin are rarely required for the diagnosis of NPD-C since the development of biochemical tests on cultured fibroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-niemann-pick-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Nonetheless, it is prudent to send a portion of the skin biopsy for electron microscopy to confirm the diagnosis in biochemical &quot;variant&quot; cases. Foam cells (ie, lipid laden macrophages) occur in bone marrow, spleen and liver. Sea blue histiocytes may be found in bone marrow.

Niemann-Pick disease types A and B are allelic disorders caused by mutations in the SMPD1 gene, and characterized by a primary deficiency of acid sphingomyelinase activity. Type C is caused by mutations of the NPC1 and NPC2 genes that result in impaired cellular processing and transport of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification and clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Niemann-Pick disease type A (NPD-A) is the acute neuronopathic form. The incidence of NPD-A is highest among Ashkenazi Jews. Affected patients present with hepatosplenomegaly, feeding difficulties and loss of early motor skills in the first few months of life. Rapid, progressive, and profound loss of neurologic function leading to death occurs by two to three years of age. Additional manifestations include peripheral neuropathy, hypotonia, loss of reflexes, and interstitial lung disease. Macular cherry red spots are eventually present in all affected individuals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65650\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65650 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'NPD type A'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Niemann-Pick disease type B (NPD-B) is pan-ethnic and generally later in onset and less severe than NPD-A, with a good prognosis for survival into adulthood. Hepatosplenomegaly develops during infancy or childhood. Other systemic manifestations include short stature with delayed skeletal maturation, interstitial lung disease, hyperlipidemia, and ocular abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65650\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65650 \">picture 1</a>). The natural history is one of progressive hypersplenism and gradual deterioration of pulmonary function. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'NPD type B'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPD-C) can present from the perinatal period until late adulthood. Most patients with NPD-C have disease onset in middle to late childhood, typically with cerebellar symptoms, slow cognitive deterioration, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, and progressive dystonia, dysarthria, and dysphagia. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'NPD type C'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of NPD first depends upon an appreciation of the variable phenotypic manifestations. The definitive diagnosis of NPD-A and NPD-B requires demonstration of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency. The definitive diagnosis of NPD-C requires demonstration of abnormal intracellular cholesterol trafficking by the impaired response to LDL-cholesterol loading in cultured fibroblasts. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of all forms of NPD is supportive. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no treatment for NPD that is proven to modify the onset or neurologic progression of the disease, or prolong lifespan.
