Despite the relative rarity, clinicians in multiple disciplines, including general surgery, emergency medicine, thoracic surgery, trauma surgery, otolaryngology, and spine surgery, must be knowledgeable regarding their diagnosis and management. </p><p>Penetrating injuries are more common than blunt injuries. Injury to adjacent structures, such as the trachea, and a delay in diagnosis of 24 hours are associated with a poor outcome. For traumatic injuries, primary surgical repair is the generally preferred treatment approach, particularly for thoracic or abdominal injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Most esophageal perforations are iatrogenic following esophageal instrumentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61112\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61112 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The most common cause of non-iatrogenic esophageal perforation is spontaneous rupture, followed by foreign body ingestion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66623\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66623 \">table 2</a>), trauma, and malignancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61112\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61112 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Spontaneous (emetogenic) rupture (Boerhaave's syndrome) and foreign body perforation of the esophagus are reviewed separately.

A two-year contemporary analysis of the National Trauma Database found 227 reported cases of penetrating esophageal trauma from 77 Level 1 and 20 Level 2 trauma centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, a review of the Scottish Trauma Audit Group (STAG) identified an annual incidence of esophageal trauma to be 0.95 per million per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>The majority of the esophageal injuries are penetrating injuries. The incidence of blunt esophageal injuries was one-tenth that of penetrating injuries at one urban Level 1 trauma center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The most common penetrating etiology is gunshot wound (75 percent) in the United States studies, followed by stab wounds, and other mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. In a series of 1921 patients with transmediastinal gunshot wounds, less than 1 percent had an esophageal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. However, in the STAG study, 57 percent of esophageal perforations were due to blunt trauma and 43 percent from penetrating trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In a 10-year, single-center retrospective review of non-iatrogenic esophageal trauma, 19 esophageal injuries were identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The mechanism of injury was gunshot wound in 18 and blunt injury in one patient. The cervical esophagus was most commonly involved, with less than 5 percent of injuries involving more than one anatomic location (eg, neck and thorax) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The most common adjacent site involved was the trachea (75 percent), although all nearby structures are at risk for injury with penetrating trauma to any portion of the esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Concomitant esophageal and tracheal perforation is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening injury. Most patients probably die at the scene of the accident or from the penetrating injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Of those who survive and are transported to a hospital, no deaths were reported in one review of 27 patients who had emergency surgical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H185506585\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of traumatic esophageal injury poses some unique challenges. As with esophageal perforation in general, timeliness of diagnosis remains a cornerstone of management. In a multivariate analysis, time delays in diagnosis were a significant predictor of esophageal-related complications following penetrating esophageal injury (odds ratio 3.13, 95% CI 1.72-5.89) (see <a href=\"#H185506627\" class=\"local\">'Morbidity and mortality'</a> below). The clinician must therefore maintain a high degree of suspicion based upon mechanism of injury (eg, gunshot, stab), site of injury (eg, neck, chest, abdomen), and the proximity of the esophagus to other identified injuries (often identified on computed tomography [CT]), particularly given that clinical symptoms and signs of esophageal injury (eg, dysphagia, neck pain, neck swelling, hypersalivation, retrosternal fullness, hematemesis, odynophagia, subcutaneous emphysema) are not reliably present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109814\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109814 \">algorithm 1</a>). In a review of 405 patients, dysphagia was present in only 7 percent and subcutaneous emphysema was identified in 19 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The initial trauma evaluation of neck or chest injury is based upon the mechanism of injury, location, and clinical condition of the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51111\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef51111 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>] and often includes CT of the neck or chest, which may identify immediately life-threatening injury (eg, aortic injury), or injury to structures (eg, vascular, laryngotracheal, spinal injury) in proximity to the esophagus; however, the overall sensitivity of CT for esophageal injury is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. In a retrospective review of 42 patients with penetrating zone II neck injuries, CT scan missed two of the four perforations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. CT has also proven useful for identifying the trajectory of transmediastinal missiles, which may or may not have a path that involves the esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. Findings on CT that suggest the esophageal injury include periesophageal air or fluid.

If endoscopy is not possible, or the results are equivocal, then esophagography can be performed. Compared with esophagoscopy, esophagography has a higher rate of false negatives, ranging from 10 to 43 percent, but may be more accurate in the thoracic compared with cervical esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/8,23,24,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,23,24,30</a>].

In one study, 4 of 18 patients (22 percent) had unremarkable findings at esophagography using a water-soluble contrast, but a perforation was subsequently detected using barium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are clinically unstable or intubated, flexible esophagoscopy should be performed in the intensive care unit or operating room. In one retrospective review, 55 patients with a suspected penetrating esophageal injury underwent emergency flexible endoscopy at a median time of three hours after presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

However, due to the multiplicity of associated injuries in this patient population, the injuries should be triaged according to severity and the surgical approach should be planned accordingly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of damage control surgery and resuscitation in patients sustaining severe injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Initial management includes securing the airway, appropriate fluid resuscitation, laboratory evaluation, and type and crossmatch.

Blind insertion of a nasogastric tube should never be attempted in a patient with suspicion for esophageal injury. </p><p>Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics should be administered covering aerobes and anaerobes. If the patient has been on a longstanding therapy with a proton pump inhibitor, antifungal therapy should also be administered, particularly for lower esophageal injuries.

The approach to traumatic esophageal perforation depends upon the location of the injury (eg, neck, chest, abdomen), severity of damage (grade of injury), hemodynamic status of the patient, and nature and severity of associated injuries. (See <a href=\"#H2084407051\" class=\"local\">'Conservative treatment'</a> below.) </p><p>Hemodynamically unstable patients are brought to the operating room because of a positive Focused Abdominal Sonography for Trauma (FAST) scan or hemothorax with bleeding from the chest tube site. The operative management of traumatic esophageal perforation is entertained only after bleeding has been controlled and hemodynamics have stabilized. It is important during the intraoperative trauma evaluation that the involved surgeons think of the potential for esophageal injury and use endoscopy, which can be performed regardless of patient positioning.</p><p>The principles of esophageal repair include debridement of contaminated and necrotic material, closure of the esophageal defect, and control of esophageal drainage. Primary repair is preferable within 24 hours from perforation; however, repair can be entertained after 24 hours depending on the degree of contamination and devitalized tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/3,5,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,34,35</a>]. If there is significant contamination, placement of a closed-suction drain is advisable and may help prevent postoperative abscess formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

In a multicenter review of 405 patients, 346 patients survived to reach the operating room, of which 175 patients had immediate surgical intervention with no preoperative evaluation. Immediate intervention patients had a higher rate of intra-abdominal esophageal injury (26 versus 10 percent) and a lower mean Revised Trauma Score (6.7 versus 7.3), but no differences in mechanism of injury, physiologic parameters, American Association for the Surgery of Trauma-Organ Injury Severity Score (AAST-OIS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72957\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72957 \">table 3</a>), or mean number of associated injuries. Those taken directly to the operating room without preoperative evaluation had significantly fewer complications compared with those who had delayed surgical intervention due to preoperative evaluations (odds ratio [OR] 3.13, 95% CI 1.72-5.89) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The mean time that elapsed for the group undergoing preoperative evaluation in the emergency department was 13 hours, with a mean of 1.7 procedures performed per patient, including esophagoscopy (73 percent), contrast studies (61 percent), and computed tomography (CT) scans (43 percent). The rate of postoperative esophageal complications was significantly higher in the patients who had preoperative evaluations in the emergency department compared with those taken directly to the operating room (41 versus 19 percent, OR 3.13). These patients also had a longer surgical intensive care unit admission (11 versus 7 days, OR 4.53). With the exception of more intra-abdominal injuries in patients taken to the operating room directly, the esophageal injuries and surgical repairs were comparable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1763257134\"><span class=\"h2\">Repair approach by injury grade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary repair of esophageal injuries can be performed whenever there is an ability to get a closure of healthy tissue without tension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/5,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,34-36</a>].

If primary repair is not possible because of contamination or hemodynamic instability, but there is only a small amount of tissue loss, an effective strategy is to repair the esophagus around a large T-tube, but this is rarely needed with the availability of esophageal stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/8,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,38,39</a>]. This creates a controlled esophageal-cutaneous fistula, which may close spontaneously after edema resolves and the T-tube is removed. Alternatively, an esophageal stent could be used to cover the defect. (See <a href=\"#H3140059526\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive esophageal stenting'</a> below.)</p><p>The esophagus should be debrided to healthy tissue and the mucosal defect should be completely exposed, even if this requires enlarging the muscular defect. Failure to close the mucosa will most assuredly result in failure of the repair. Intraoperative endoscopy can be helpful for identifying the extent of the defect. The mucosal defect should be closed first, followed by a second-layer closure of the muscularis layer. There are no studies comparing the techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/5,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,35</a>]. Some recommend absorbable suture with knots on the outside to avoid granuloma formation, but this has not been subjected to rigorous evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Larger defects or those involving significant devascularization (IV, V) require more challenging surgical management. Typically in the traumatic circumstance, esophagectomy with reconstruction is not indicated due to the length and technical nature of the procedure as well as the patient's hemodynamic status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Rather, esophageal diversion may be required. This includes creation of an end cervical esophagostomy and division of the esophagus at the gastroesophageal junction to exclude the site of injury. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, removal of the thoracic esophagus should be performed. In the unstable patient, the thoracic esophagus may be left in situ with removal later once the patient is stable. While in the abdomen, a gastrostomy is recommended but should be placed strategically so as to not damage the subsequent formation of a gastric tube for reconstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. Feeding jejunostomy is also recommended, although only in stable patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/5,8,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,35,36</a>].

No comparisons have been made with nonoperative surgical repair. Although there is minimal experience in the trauma population, temporary esophageal stenting may be an alternative to open surgical repair among those patients who, at least initially, are not deemed fit for surgery or who have multiple other injuries that take precedent. When elected, stent placement should only be attempted by an experienced endoscopist. Additionally, drainage of the contaminated field is a necessary adjunct to stent placement for source control of the infection, which can be done thoracoscopically. In addition, a route needs to be provided for enteral nutrition. Endoscopic stent placement for patients with an esophageal perforation is discussed in more detail elsewhere.

However, the chest should also be prepped into the field in case broader exposure is required. Violation of the platysma by a penetrating object predicts deeper injury of vital neck structures 24 to 33 percent of the time. This includes a 10.8 to 12.6 percent rate of esophageal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Due to the anatomic confines of the neck, cervical esophageal injuries can often be managed with drainage alone. First and foremost is the identification of associated injuries including the airway, major vessels, and spine. Dissection should begin along the lateral edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle with judicious use of cautery. The omohyoid muscle is then divided and the lateral aspect of the esophagus is exposed. Care must be taken to avoid injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which includes careful retraction of the deeper structures (a finger on the trachea is best), minimal use of cautery, and, if cautery is used, bipolar rather than monopolar cautery. The retroesophageal space should be opened sharply. If an injury is readily identified, it may be closed in two layers without tension. Otherwise, closed-suction drains may be simply placed behind the esophagus and in any potentially contaminated space with subsequent wound closure. The patient should be kept nil per os (NPO) and restudied with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> esophagram in approximately one week based on drain output.</p><p>If a coexistent airway injury is identified, repair of both injuries is indicated with rotation of a muscle flap between the repairs to avoid development of a tracheoesophageal fistula. </p><p>Other considerations in the context of trauma include the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the anatomic proximity of the cervical esophagus to the trachea and other vital structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54654\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54654 \">figure 1B</a>), the surgeon must evaluate for possible coexistent injuries to prevent complications such as tracheoesophageal fistula. Further investigation for injury to the upper airway and upper gastrointestinal tract can then be undertaken in the operating room using bronchoscopy, laryngoscopy, and esophagoscopy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing can include endoscopic insufflation of the cervical esophagus while the wound is irrigated to identify air leaking into the wound, which would be indicative of injury to the trachea or esophagus. Endoscopy can also aid in identifying a perforation that might be obscured by hematoma, to evaluate the opposite side to help identify a through-and-through injury, and to insufflate air following repair to assess for a leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interposition of a muscle flap between the repaired esophagus and other structures is essential in combined repairs (esophagus-trachea, esophagus-carotid artery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/35,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,44,45</a>]. This can be accomplished using typically a strap muscle, but the sternocleidomastoid muscle can be detached and rotated at either end to buttress the esophageal repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The wound should be irrigated and well drained (closed-suction). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Care must be taken to avoid injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve running in the tracheoesophageal groove. This includes careful identification of anatomy, avoidance of monopolar cautery near the tracheoesophageal groove, and the use of soft retractors. Based on the mechanism of trauma, if bilateral nerve injury is suspected, tracheostomy may be necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensive injury to the cervical spine may result in an esophageal injury being overlooked. Subspecialists dealing with spine injury must remain wary of these events given the proximity of the esophagus to the spinal column.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The wound should be irrigated with isotonic saline and drained well with closed-suction drains (eg, Jackson-Pratt drains) placed in the periesophageal space and brought out through counter incisions in the lateral neck.

For those in whom nonoperative management is tried, restricted oral intake and intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended during healing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-tract-perforation#H12750244\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal tract perforation&quot;, section on 'Conservative care'</a>.)</p><p>Cervical perforation is most commonly considered for nonoperative management but, for blunt or penetrating traumatic injury, is usually managed operatively. The available data pertaining to management of nontraumatic cervical esophageal perforations are few and low quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/40,41,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41,46</a>]. One small study in a series of trauma patients suggested that nonoperative management could be safe and effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Given the low rate of complications with neck exploration, it would be difficult to justify any complications related to a nonoperative approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Injuries to the hypopharynx may often be safely managed nonoperatively. The low intraluminal pressure and the overlapping middle and inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscles facilitate a rapid, spontaneous seal of stab and small gunshot wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/27,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,48</a>]. In the lower hypopharynx (ie, below the tips of the arytenoid cartilages), or in the setting of extensive tissue damage, operative intervention is often necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Perforation into the pleural or peritoneal cavity is a relative contraindication to nonoperative management due to the difficulties of controlling spillage. A patient with a very small, contained thoracic perforation and no signs of sepsis may be managed nonoperatively. Published series have reported good outcomes following nonoperative management of small, contained iatrogenic thoracic esophageal perforations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/41,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,46</a>], but a major distinction between traumatic and nontraumatic perforations is that trauma may disrupt the tissue planes and thereby the potential containment of the esophageal leak. If nonoperative management of traumatic esophageal perforation is attempted, it should only be done with the guidance of a multidisciplinary team experienced in the care of complex esophageal pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3533123\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative management, including monitoring for dehiscence and leaks, is discussed separately.

As an example, given the proximity of the thoracic esophagus to major vascular structures, injuries in this region are often fatal. In a six-year retrospective review, esophageal trauma occurred in 0.14 percent of 231,694 trauma patients; the presence of esophageal trauma was an independent predictor of mortality (odds ratio = 3.42, 95% CI 2.50-4.71) in this large study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p>Complications of surgery for repair of esophageal perforation are mainly related to breakdown of the repair with ensuing esophageal leak and infection.

Mortality for grade I injuries was 8 percent, and the mortality for grade V injuries was 67 percent. Over 75 percent of postoperative deaths were due to exsanguination. Postoperative morbidity was also high within this study, with 33 percent of patients having at least one postoperative complication and 25 percent with at least one esophageal complication. Most of the esophageal complications were related to postoperative infections, including abscess, mediastinitis, and empyema, and 1.4 percent developed a tracheoesophageal fistula.
